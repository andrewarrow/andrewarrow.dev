      It hit me one day, the biggest problem every indie developer has is very simple.
      You need to go <span style="background-color: #ffeb3b; color: #000; padding: 0 3px;">from one to two as quickly as possible</span>. i.e. stop being "indie" of
      just a team of one. It simply doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
      Just like starting a band, you need that 2nd member or you're not _really_ a band.
      Sure, I know, I've been doing teams of one for many years. I get the appeal. But
      what is it that I like so much about it? I don't have to get _any_ buy in from
      <strong>anyone</strong>. I'm this <span style="background-color: #4caf50; color: #fff; padding: 0 3px;">free agent that can just code code code like an artist</span> and bring
      whatever I want to life.
      </p>
      <p>
      And how's that working out for ya?
      </p>
      <p>
      Not good. I work very hard on the project, get to MVP, release it, and get depressed
      at how hard it is to market. Why am I trying to get buy in <span style="background-color: #ff5252; color: #fff; padding: 0 3px;">AFTER doing all the work</span>?
      Just because I'm too impatient and scared* to get the buy in FIRST.
      </p>
      <p>
      * yeah, fear, fear of doing this:

      This is a new app I'm making to fix this problem. I call it from122.

      First you name your project...
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2SJe4l3.png" width="300"/>
      <p>
      We are going to use your camera for some high tech face recognition...
      </p>

      <p>
      That's right. Goto starbuck and get over your fear.
      </p>

      <p>
      iOS Face Recognition will find faces and "match" you with just the right
      person.

      Now go, you have 3 mins. Sell this person on your idea. Ask them if they
      want to be recorded of course, be polite, some people will say no.
      </p>

      <p>
      This demo project now has 1 recorded session. Do 10 more.
      </p>
      <p>
      Terrible right? I hate everything about this. I really don't want
      to go to starbucks and do this. I hate accosting strangers.
