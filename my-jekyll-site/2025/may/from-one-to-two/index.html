      It hit me one day, the biggest problem every indie developer has is very simple.
      You need to go from one to two as quickly as possible. i.e. stop being "indie" of
      just a team of one. It simply doesn't work.

      Just like starting a band, you need that 2nd member or you're not _really_ a band.
      Sure, I know, I've been doing teams of one for many years. I get the appeal. But
      what is it that I like so much about it? I don't have to get _any_ buy in from
      _anyone_ I'm this free agent that can just code code code like an artist and bring
      whatever I want to life.
