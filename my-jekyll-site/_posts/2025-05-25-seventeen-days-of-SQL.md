      We found this kitten (we think about 4 weeks old?) on the street and took her or him in. Never did get a definitive gender. We already had one cat so we named this one sequel but spelled it the tech way SQL.

      Very cute kitten but she was scratching all the time and had these like clumps of scabs on her fur from scratching so much. I should have known we needed to treat her before playing with her but her cuteness won and I started touching and petting her. Then a few days later I was itching! Red spots on my skin. She tested positive for Notoedris Cati, Feline scabies.

      They say feline scabies can't live on human skin, it will just go away on its own. HA! I got a prescription for permethrin and that's the only thing that made the itching stop. So around 7 weeks old and 1.5 lbs we went to the vet and the doctor agreed to give her the normal flea and mite treatment (Selamectin) you give an 8 week old 2 lbs kitten. He said she was under age and weight for that medicine but the scabies had to be treated.

      Kitten hung in there for 2 days after getting the meds, it seemed to be working, but this morning she wasn't moving. We only knew SQL for 17 days.
