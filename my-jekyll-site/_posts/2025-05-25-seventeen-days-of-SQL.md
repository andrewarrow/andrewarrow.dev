We found this kitten (we think about 4 weeks old?) on the street and took her or him in. Never did get a definitive gender. We already had one cat so we named this one sequel but spelled it the tech way SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
Very cute kitten but she was scratching all the time and had these like clumps of scabs on her fur from scratching so much. I should have known we needed to treat her before playing with her but her cuteness one and I started touching and petting her. Then a few days later I was itching! Red spots on my skin. She tested positive for Notoedris Cati, Feline scabies.
      </p>
      <p>
They say feline scabies can't live on human skin, it will just go away on its own. HA! I got a perscription for permethrin and that's the only thing that made the itching stop. So around 7 weeks old and 1.5 lbs we went to the vet and the doctor agree to give her the normal flea and mite treatment (Selamectin) you give an 8 week old 2 lbs kitten. He said she was under age and weight for that medicine but the scabies had to be treated.
      </p>

Kitten hung in there for 2 days after getting the meds, it seemed to be working, but this morning she wasn't moving. We only knew sql for 17 days</p>
