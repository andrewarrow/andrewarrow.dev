      That's right. Ken can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_in_tongues">speak in tongues</a>. And he has left the tech world and is now a

I asked some LLM to listen. They were pretty harsh:

<pre>
```
This is a very clear example of gibberish or nonsense speech.

Not a Recognizable Language: The sounds and syllable combinations do not form words or grammar of any known human language.

Rapid and Fluent: The speaker delivers the sounds very quickly and smoothly, mimicking the fluency of actual speech.

Varied Phonetics: The speaker uses a range of phonetic sounds, including:

    Rolled or trilled 'r's (e.g., "parriarro," "tirriettia")

    Plosive consonants (k, t, p)

    Sibilants (sh, s)

    A variety of vowel sounds.

Dynamic Intonation: The pitch and stress rise and fall, mimicking the prosody (rhythm and intonation patterns) of natural speech, giving it a semblance of sentences and phrases.

Intentional Performance: The English words "Perfect. Just basic stuff" at the very end (around 0:14-0:16) clearly indicate that the preceding sounds were an intentional performance or demonstration of vocal ability, rather than an attempt to communicate in an actual language.

In essence, it's someone skillfully "faking" a foreign-sounding language.
It's the kind of vocalization sometimes used in acting, comedy, or 
demonstrations of vocal range, sometimes also referred to as "speaking in tongues"
(glossolalia) though in this context, it's clearly a practiced performance.

Ouch. <span style="color: #cc6600; font-weight: bold;">"it's clearly a practiced performance."</span>
