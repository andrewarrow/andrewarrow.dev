I&#39;m Daddy Jack. This is Adam. We are
Sons of Legion. So, we have this wild
idea. There is a band that has recently
gone viral, which everybody is talking
about right now. Now, this band is
assumed to be an AI band.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We don&#39;t want to jump to conclusions,
but it&#39;s looking kind of AI.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. This is the band we&#39;re
referring to.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And this is the song.
Dust on the wind,
boots on the ground,
smoke in the sky, no peace found,
rivers run red, the drums roll slow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, we decided to do a little
experiment. We were kind of in a unique
position to do it because we had the
ability to kind of create a cover of
this song right here in the studio, just
between Adam and I. We thought it would
be an interesting way to gauge people&#39;s
reactions and see if people can actually
tell the difference between something
computerenerated and something that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; has soul,
something that actually has soul.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, we thought this would be really
interesting and we also thought that um
maybe not everyone is aware that these
things are going on right now. You
prompt and you say, &#34;Hey, make me a song
that sounds like da da da and da da da.&#34;
And about 30 seconds later, the computer
generates a song for you. And there you
have it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;ll get to judge for yourself. You
get to listen to both songs and see
which one do you like. We also, in a
follow-up video that you can probably
watch, we&#39;ll start putting up some
clips. You&#39;ll see when we went down to
Broadway here in Nashville where the
heart of American music, and we asked
people, can you tell the difference? And
I think when you see the reactions, it&#39;s
actually quite shocking. This is
something that is is poignant to music
history. It&#39;s happening right now. And
when you get a chance to look at those
videos, you&#39;ll see reactions that are
physical, they&#39;re emotional, but
sometimes people are a little bit
confused. They&#39;re not really sure. And
that&#39;s the part that makes this whole
entire social experiment very
interesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we are in a time where we have
never been here before. Um, where people
are already unable to tell the
difference or a lot of people are unable
to tell the difference between something
computerenerated and something human
generated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let us know what you think. Uh, there&#39;s
no right or wrong in this. We&#39;re just
really just here to see what happens and
and put it out into the world.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bringing in some big mic stands.
These will be for the drums.
So, we&#39;re just setting up microphones on
the drums. This is like a whole art form
in and of itself of which I don&#39;t claim
to be an expert, but there are people
that have spent their entire lives being
masterful recording engineers um going
back, you know, to the 30s, 40s, 50s,
especially 60s just learning how to get
the best tones out of drums. That human
touch I think is important there too
because you had a dedicated engineer and
somebody who wasn&#39;t thinking about the
songwriting, wasn&#39;t thinking about the,
you know, the parts or the composition.
His job was just to figure out the
microphones and get the best sound as
possible. And that has over time become,
you know, a lot of the iconic and famous
drum sounds that we&#39;ve heard on some of
the best recordings ever made. We&#39;re
going to do our best to get a good drum
tone here.
guitar mic, room mic,
two vocals.
These are going to be toms.
This is a high hat.
And this will be our bass DI.
Dust on the wind. Okay, cool. Smoke in
the sky, no peace found. The rivers run
red, the drums roll slow.
Tell me brother, where do we go? Right,
that&#39;s it.
Dust on the wind,
boots on the ground,
smoke in the sky. No peace found, the
rivers run red, the drums roll slow.
Tell me brother, where do we go?
Raise your hand.
Don&#39;t look away.
Sing out loud.
Make them pay.
March for peace,
not for
let that turn with the time.
cry out.
Bullets fly.
Mama prays while young men die.
There she&#39;s
We still got time to make a stand.
Raise your hand
Sing out loud.

truth won&#39;t be.
Let the song fight till the end.
