You&#39;ve been lied to about the gods of
ancient Greece. The Zeus you&#39;ve seen in
movies. The wise thundering father who
keeps the cosmos in order. He wasn&#39;t
He was a user.
A seducer.
A king who ruled more through fear than

into one. And Hades, the so-called devil
of Greek myth, he was probably the most
just fur god of them all.
Somewhere along the way, these myths
were polished,
smoothed for storytellers who needed
clean heroes and simple villains.
The gods became noble. The monsters
became evil.
The stories became safe.
But the oldest myths, they weren&#39;t safe.
They were raw, bloody, and painfully
So, let&#39;s go back, back to the versions
that still echo with dirt under the
fingernails.
Welcome to vortex mythology,
where legends bleed and the truth isn&#39;t

We&#39;ll begin with the god everyone feared
for all the wrong reasons.
say Hades,
and most people picture the Greek devil,
black robes, a throne of bones,
rivers of fire.
But the truth, Hades wasn&#39;t the Greek
Satan. He didn&#39;t rebel. He didn&#39;t tempt
He didn&#39;t torture souls for fun. After
the fall of the Titans, the three
brothers divided the universe.
Zeus claimed the sky. Poseidon took the
sea, and Hades was left with the
underworld,
not as punishment, but as duty.
Imagine it. A realm beneath the earth,
endless and silent, where shadows
wandered in meadows of gray. No fire, no
just stillness.
Unlike his brothers, Hades almost never
left his realm.
He didn&#39;t roam the earth seducing
mortals like Zeus. He didn&#39;t smash
cities in rage like Poseidon. He stayed
in the shadows,
silent and steady,
making sure the dead stayed where they
And the Greeks saw him as fair.
If you lived a decent life, you weren&#39;t
dragged into eternal fire.
You simply drifted into the Asphodel
a place neither punishment nor paradise.
Even the famous abduction of Pphanie
isn&#39;t simple.
Yes, he took her. But in the Elusinian
mysteries,
one of Greece&#39;s oldest sacred rights,
her descent wasn&#39;t seen as a kidnapping.
It was a passage,
a ritual of transformation.
Some believed Pphanie chose to eat the
pomegranate seeds, binding herself to
both worlds.
Hades wasn&#39;t a villain.
He was inevitable.
He didn&#39;t make you fear him.
Hades reminds us that death is
inevitable.
But what happens when cruelty doesn&#39;t
come from death, but from the gods who
are still alive?
When it comes to the infamous Medusa,
most likely you know the ending.
Perseus the hero, the winged sandals,
the shining shield, the snake herd
creature who turned men to stone.
But before the snakes, before the curse,
Medusa was a mortal priestess.
She served Athena in quiet devotion,
sworn to remain pure.
And then Poseidon wanted her.
And like so many Greek gods, he didn&#39;t
He took her right there in Athena&#39;s
temple, defiling the sacred place.
And what did the goddess of wisdom do?
Did she defend her servant? Punish
Athena turned on Medusa.
She cursed her hair into writhing
Made her face so terrifying
no man could look at her without turning
to stone.
It was a sentence worse than death.
Medusa was alive,
but utterly alone.
So horrifying that even her own
reflection was unbearable.
Earlier myths didn&#39;t even single her
out. The Gorgans were just vague
monstrous shadows at the edge of the
world. But over time, her story became
And here&#39;s the crulest twist. When
Perseus severed her head, from her blood
sprang Pegasus, the winged horse, a
symbol of freedom born from her
suffering.
Perseus even used her severed head as a
weapon before offering it to Athena.
the same goddess who cursed her. If
you&#39;d like to learn more about Medusa&#39;s
story and also what became of her
severed head, be sure to watch our other
two videos.
The Greeks didn&#39;t tell this story of
Medusa to warn you about monsters.
They told it to warn you about gods.
And no god embodied the danger of power.
The raw unrestrained will to rule like
the one who sat at top Olympus.
See how every hero hides a tragedy.
Every gift a curse. And at the top of it
The Zeus. You picture
a fatherly king, calm and wise.
That&#39;s a later invention.
The oldest myths describe someone far
more ruthless.
Zeus wasn&#39;t born on Olympus.
He was hidden in a cave while his father
Cronis swallowed his siblings whole.
When Zeus came of age, he poisoned
Cronis, cut open his stomach, and freed
his brothers and sisters.
Then came war.
10 years of cosmic slaughter.
Zeus held mountains as weapons,
unleashed monstrous allies with a
hundred hands,
and finally chained the Titans in the
deepest pit of Tartarus,
the depths of the Greek underworld.
And remember,
this was the beginning of his reign, not
the worst of it. Because even after
victory, his reign was never gentle.
Zeus kept his throne through force and
His loves were often victims.
Europa abducted as a bull.
Leader seduced or assaulted as a swan.
Semile burned alive when he revealed his
true form.
Zeus wasn&#39;t a protector of justice.
He was simply the most powerful being in
the room. The Greeks didn&#39;t worship Zeus
because he was good. They worshiped him
because he was untouchable.
And even the gods who served him, who
were supposed to stand for wisdom and
order, could be just as unyielding.
If even the king of the gods ruled
through fear,
what hope was there in wisdom?
Because in these myths,
even wisdom has teeth.
Athena is often softened into a goddess
of calm strategy, rationality,
and learning.
A patron of cities, art, and wisdom.
But wisdom in Greek myth isn&#39;t gentle.
It&#39;s sharp.
It cuts. When Arachnne dared to weave
tapestries that rivaled the gods, Athena
didn&#39;t praise her. She destroyed her.
Humiliated, beaten, and transformed into
a spider to weave forever in silence.
When arresties stood trial for killing
his mother, Athena cast the deciding
vote not for justice, but for the
father&#39;s authority
over the mothers.
And as we&#39;ve seen, Medusa&#39;s fate was
sealed by Athena&#39;s hand. The temple
the victim cursed. Her justice was born
from order. And in her world, order
didn&#39;t care who got hurt in the process.
But some didn&#39;t bow to wisdom&#39;s cold
Some risked everything to give humanity
hope. And none paid a higher price than
Prometheus.
A price paid in blood.
Prometheus is remembered as the noble
The Titan who stole fire for humanity
and paid the price. Chained to a rock,
his liver devoured daily by an eagle.
But the older myths tell a darker truth.
Prometheus didn&#39;t just give us fire.
He provoked the gods. At a sacred
sacrifice, he tricked Zeus himself,
hiding bones beneath glistening fat so
humans could keep the best meat. Zeus
saw through the trick
and took revenge.
The fire he is so known for wasn&#39;t just
a gift. It was punishment,
a curse wrapped in flame.
And Zeus wasn&#39;t finished. He sent
another gift.
beautiful,
and carrying a jar meant to be opened.
When she did, outpoured sickness, death,
every misery known to humankind.
Prometheus&#39;s defiance didn&#39;t save us. It
cursed us
with suffering
and the burden of knowledge we were
never meant to hold.
His name means forthought.
But even he couldn&#39;t see how heavy his
gift would become.
And if you&#39;re still here, you&#39;re already
seeing how these myths twist heroes into
villains. and gifts into curses.
So before we go deeper, make sure you&#39;re
subscribed
because the next story cuts even closer
to the bone.
Orpheus is remembered as the devoted
lover, the musician who charmed the
underworld to bring his wife Uritysy
back to life.
But devotion isn&#39;t always love.
And in some versions of the myth,
Uritysy wasn&#39;t grateful.
She was furious.
Orpheus didn&#39;t descend into the
underworld for her.
He did it because he couldn&#39;t let go.
And when he finally led her back toward
the living world, there was one
condition. He must not look back.
But just as they reached the threshold,
the final step into light, he turned.
In that moment, she was lost forever.
His need to see her destroyed his chance
to save her.
And in her final breath, she didn&#39;t
thank him. She blamed him.
Orpheus himself couldn&#39;t live among the
living anymore.
He turned away from women entirely.
Some say he turned to boys.
Others say he sang only to death itself.
and the mayads,
the frenzied women of Dionisus,
ripped him apart.
That was not out of cruelty, but because
he refused to join life again.
He belonged to the underworld
long before his body followed.
And the Maynards,
they followed a god where joy slipped
into madness so easily you couldn&#39;t tell
the difference.
And that god wasn&#39;t kind.
He didn&#39;t take your mind.
He simply made you hand it over.
Dionisus is often painted as the god of
wine, joy, and endless celebration.
But drink too deeply and the sweetness
turns sour.
Because beneath the wine was frenzy,
beneath the music was madness.
In famous Greek tragedy, the backy, King
Pentheus mocked him, laughed at the
women who danced in his honor,
denied him his rights. So, Dionus didn&#39;t
strike him down with a bolt of lightning
or a plague.
That would have been merciful.
Instead, he unraveled his mind.
Pantheus thought he was spying on
worshippers.
Thought he was in control.
But Dionus whispered illusions into his
Visions so vivid they felt real.
That&#39;s the danger of Dianisis.
You never realize you&#39;ve lost yourself
until it&#39;s already too late. And when
the frenzy took hold, it wasn&#39;t Dionis
who killed him.
It was his own mother, Agave.
Her mind shattered.
Seeing not her son, but a wild lion. She
tore him apart with her bare hands.
and paraded his head like a trophy,
smiling through her madness.
Dionisus was life and death in one.
He was both died and reborn
again and again.
He melted away the boundary between
mortal and divine
sanity and delirium
until there was nothing left but chaos.
Because Dionus isn&#39;t the god who frees
He&#39;s the god who peels away the thin
mask of order you cling to and shows you
the chaos underneath.
And maybe that&#39;s why the Greeks feared
him most of all because you can fight a
But how do you fight yourself?
The Greeks didn&#39;t worship perfection.
They worshiped power,
forces beyond human control, clothed in
names and faces.
And those forces didn&#39;t care if you
called them good or evil.
They are just gods.
Hera&#39;s jealousy turned innocent mortals
into beasts.
Poseidon drowned entire cities over
petty insults.
Hermes stole, lied, and tricked and
laughed while doing it. And if you&#39;d
like to dive deeper into other Greek
gods and their stories, please do let us
know in the comments.
The Greek gods weren&#39;t there to teach
you morality.
They weren&#39;t examples to follow.
They were reflections,
mirrors of a world that was chaotic,
beautiful, and cruel all at once. They
lied. They punished. They seduced. They
destroyed.
Not because they were evil, but because
they simply were.
And if you crossed them, there was no
forgiveness.
No second chance,
only ruin in its many guises and forms.
So the next time you hear these myths,
remember what survived wasn&#39;t meant to
comfort you.
It was meant to warn you.
Please do give this video a thumbs up
and consider subscribing for more
mythology that doesn&#39;t flinch.
Because the gods may be forgotten,
but they&#39;re not gone.
They&#39;re just waiting for you to call
their names.
