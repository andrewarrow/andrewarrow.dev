I&#39;m Jason with the All Things Open team.
I&#39;m here with Dr. Ruth. We&#39;re going to
talk about AI, productivity, and a bunch
of other topics. Uh Dr. Ruth, will you
please introduce yourself to the All
Things Open community?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, All Things Open community. My name
is Dr. Ruth Atkinson,
and I am a Christian. I&#39;m the mom of
three beautiful daughters. I am married
to a cloud engineer, Tulu, my lovely
husband. I work for SAS. Um, I&#39;m
currently live re leading their
generative AI team for their data
management division. I graduated with a
PhD, a computer science PhD from North
Carolina State University in 2021. And I
love to code and I love artificial
intelligence.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Cool. Thanks for being here. I&#39;m
so excited. I understand you&#39;re
passionate about artificial
intelligence, but the kind that has a
positive impact on humans and society.
What type of advancements are you seeing
with AI in that regards?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, as you said, I am passionate about
AI, leveraging AI for early disease
prediction from medical records. It
could be detecting of um suspicious
activities for security. um using
computer vision and it could also be
identifying emotional stress for health
as well and I&#39;m even looking at
exploring the power of AI for to assess
spiritual well-being which is one new
idea that I just had in recent times. So
um we&#39;ve seen a lot of advancements um
GPT advancements GPT models and we&#39;ve
seen computer vision object recognition
before my PhD I used to be fascinated
with computer vision I used to be
fascinated with face recognition that&#39;s
one of the things that drove me to
motivated me to pursue my PhD although I
ended up working leveraging artificial
intelligence for computer games and
improving educational games we have seen
all this GPT advancement. It just tells
us that AI is in in its early stages and
its vast potential is yet to be
explored. I&#39;m thinking around health
security as I&#39;ve said before, emotional
emotional well-being for health. We
could deploy natural language models
going into health record electro
electronic health records doctor&#39;s notes
to just analyze the data to check for
patterns of disease diseases like
diabetes cancer cardiovascular
conditions and all this would help
improve lives in meaningful ways when
these models can predict when you get
everything into text there&#39;s nothing you
cannot do with GPT models I talked about
computer vision for security. When you
get this CCTV footages and you get to
translate what they saying into text and
you plug in GPT models to analyze this
text, it can ensure intelligence from
these footages. Then we are in going
into an area of agentic AI where agents
can make decisions. So get see of
envision a scenario where you have text
from CCTV footages submitted to an LLM
model. The LLM model is analyzing this
text and seeing suspicious activities
and then sending function calls to the
CCTV camera to pointing to or zoom in on
different a different direction. Right?
So when you impute or infuse the
advancements like GPT models into all
these other areas like IoT, medical and
healthcare, you would see a vast
improvement and I&#39;m excited about that.
The fact that you can use AI as a tool
to engender great breakthroughs and
innovation that f fascinates me a lot.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I totally I think it&#39;s amazing. Uh, and
I think that&#39;s really kind of where AI
should be helping humans, right? It&#39;s
really great to see that potential for
the future. What are some of the current
limitations and making some of those
advancements?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a good question. All this
beautiful dreams, they can actually come
true because we&#39;ve seen GPT come true. I
love GPT. I used to love computer
vision. That&#39;s why I talk computer
vision, now GPT. All this just show that
we are still in the inception and there
are greater things ahead of us. But in
order to achieve all this, we need
resources. Resources like big data, um,
deep learning, architectures,
infrastructures to become more powerful.
And then we also need to ensure that we
are doing all this in an ethical way.
Right? I talked about IoT. I talked
about analyzing electrical electronic
health records. We would face
limitations such as privacy, data
privacy, data security and bias. So if
we can put strategies in place to ensure
that um all these things are done and AI
is being used in an ethical way, then
it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be a win-win for
everybody.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that&#39;s great. What&#39;s your advice
to someone who&#39;s just getting started
with artificial intelligence? like if
they if they&#39;re not even a technologist,
what would you suggest?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a good question as well. I would
like to talk about what worked for me
and that we should let&#39;s start from
there. My first AI project was back in
2015. I created a linear regression
model to predict how much of a
customer&#39;s invoice would they pay up
within 6 months. Right? So while working
on this problem, I was really fascinated
and it got me into researching how to
solve it. So for somebody that is just
starting learning or want to know more
about artificial intelligence, what is
the data problem you are trying to
solve? So when I identified that data
problem I was trying to solve, I started
doing research and now we have GPT that
can tell you what to do from start to
finish. can just put in the question to
a GPT model or GPT and ask how do I go
about solving this problem. So um for me
I didn&#39;t have GBT I had Google and so I
took courses recommended courses on
Corsera. My first data science course
was the data scientist toolbox and it it
had a capstone project creating a data
product and the data product was an
engram model for next word prediction.
Yeah. So that&#39;s that was what got me
excited. Right. I I completed the course
from start to finish. I learned the our
programming language. So identifying the
problem you&#39;re trying to work on, seeing
the courses that can help you solve it
um is the first steps. You could also
take it a level higher because I wanted
to do computer vision and get a degree
in data science or artificial
intelligence and that will teach you the
mathematics behind the data science, the
mathematics behind AI and help you be
more confident when choosing what
machine learning or AI algorithms to use
to solving your problems and then build
a portfolio. So when you have projects
that you have worked on, you can add
that to your resume and gives you more
confident that okay, confidence that you
an AI expert.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s so cool. I think that&#39;s a really
good framework and I think you shared
with our audience um a good plan of
attack that they can use to to get
involved. So there&#39;s a lot of discussion
about AI&#39;s role in development. Do you
think AI is going to replace developers
one day?
You are the third person asking me this
question and I think mo not just the
third person so many people have asked
me this question. I do not believe that
AI will replace developers. However, it
could transform the role significantly.
Software developers would need to learn
how to adapt and infuse AI models in
their applications. And this could even
lead to a new generation of software
development. This evolution could
redefine the software developer title to
something like AI integrator.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And AI integrator um as more of AI
capabilities and expertise are needed
when a need arises in app development.
And and so I feel like generative AI is
just helping us solve new challenges and
it could push the boundaries of what&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, listeners, you&#39;ve heard it from
Dr. Ruth. AI is going to change the
Uh and AI is going to have new job
titles. That&#39;s the most exciting part.
Do you have any new tools you&#39;ve been
using to boost your productivity lately?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I will not discount the effect of note
takingaking applications. So, like many
others, I use to-do lists a lot, and it
helps me push through my day. However,
when I get to a point where no level of
organization or planning or structure
can help me push through, there&#39;s this
one app that resets my mind and restores
my peace, and it&#39;s the Bible app.
Reading scriptures, connecting with God,
just gives me clarity and keeps me
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sounds great. Thanks for sharing. Last
question for you. What&#39;s one tip, best
practice or piece of advice you have to
share with the all things open
community?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You all are doing a great job. Honestly,
every post, every commit to an open
source project goes a long way and makes
a difference. You might not realize how
much you&#39;re helping people, but you&#39;re
helping people in unique ways. So, I
just want to say to the opensource
community, don&#39;t stop innovating. Don&#39;t
stop learning and sharing your
knowledge.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great. That&#39;s great advice. Thanks for
your time today, Dr. Ruth. We really
appreciate it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, Jason.
