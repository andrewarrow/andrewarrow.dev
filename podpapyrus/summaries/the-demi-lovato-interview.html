What&#39;s up everyone? It&#39;s Chicks in the
Office with Ran Fran giving you that
Friday energy on a Tuesday. Happy
Tuesday everybody. This is a dream
episode. Yes, it is.
This is a super exciting episode. It&#39;s
an emotional episode. So much to
discuss, but the main focus is we have
the one and only Demi Lovato on this
Unfreaking real.
Unbelievable.
having to keep this in for the short
amount of time that we&#39;ve known.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It hasn&#39;t been
that long, but
hasn&#39;t been that long, but
wow. Like just bursting at the seams. So
excited. So emotional about it. Really
cried all weekend long thinking about
it. It&#39;s just really
quite the moment. just the way
everything ended up working out, having
this interview booked and then
being at the Jaws Brothers show
Sunday night and having her come out
like it is just really the best 24 hours
ever. Ever. I It&#39;s just I fell to the
ground. I could not believe what was
happening. Um, and I&#39;m just so excited
for everybody to to hear the interview.
I&#39;m so excited for everybody to hear the
interview. I&#39;m so excited for to talk
about last night&#39;s Joe Brothers concert.
It&#39;s just insane to think about Demi
coming out of the concert last night and
less than 24 hours later,
walking straight into the Chicks in the
Office studio,
walking right into our studio. I mean, I
I know that our listeners and everybody
listening knows how much this really
means to us, but yet again, it still
doesn&#39;t feel like it can be talked about
enough and put into words enough. Like,
I know that I say I I cry a lot at
things or I get emotional at things.
I really do mean it, though. Like,
thinking about this and finding this out
really just made me so emotional. I know
obviously you feel the same way. Just
thinking about our childhood and our
younger selves, seeing this moment
happen now. Like I just could have never
imagined, you know, the person obsessing
over all things Disney Channel,
obsessing over everybody, obsessing over
Demi Lovado, and then thinking that my
older self would be sitting down
interviewing her after she
comes out at the Jonas Brothers concert.
Like, none of it makes sense. And it
feels like we are living a fake life and
living in a fake world. Um, and I just
think about that person who was like
locked in her purple bedroom just like
with all the magazines and writing
things on my wall and just like wanting
to be around these people and admiring
them so much and now getting to
interview Demi. Like it&#39;s just
unbelievable. Like I I just when you
listen to those songs, you just go right
back into to feeling exactly how you did
as a kid when you were listening. Even
more so now. And Demi has fantastic
new music.
Like unbelievable new music that I know
everyone&#39;s going to love.
Absolutely. It&#39;s like full It It just
really does like you said, like feels so
full circle having these moments. She&#39;s
by far one of those guests that we&#39;ve
always dreamed of having on, been a fan
of for so long. Just the
experience of having
the show happen when it did and the
interview happen when it did is just
like so perfect and felt like really
feels like fate in some sort of way.
like thinking about how I,
you know, was at those thinking about
being at PNC Bank at down in down in
Homeell, New Jersey. Claire and I going
to the Jones Brothers shows at that
time. Demi opened and like we were so
obsessed with her. We loved all those
albums, those like, you know, Don&#39;t
Forget and Here We Go Again. And like
it&#39;s just such a staple of growing up
and being, you know, so solid in our
lives and then going to Metife and being
with Claire and having the like
watching the Jones Brothers show and
then also them just be like this welcome
De like insane a dream come true really
growing up and wanting to sound like
Demi Levant. You know what I mean? Like
just wanting that voice of like the most
incredible voice. seriously one of the
best voices of our generation. I told
her that during the interview,
but so special and so honored that she
decided to sit down with us today after
all of this happened. Like we couldn&#39;t
feel more honored and feel so so so
happy and excited to share this
interview with everybody and um see how
excited everyone else is as well to hear
this. like it was a dream. Um, and this
is just peak peak peak career moment and
a life moment in general.
Absolutely. And this is going to be the
whole episode because got there&#39;s
nothing else. I mean really there&#39;s
nothing else to talk about. We&#39;re going
to go right into the interview. We of
course will recap our experiences at the
show afterwards as well because there&#39;s
so much to dissect from the night. But
we just really have to dedicate the the
episode to her. I know there&#39;s a lot
going on. We&#39;ll get to it on Wednesday
for sure. Yes. Um, you know, a lot of
other topics and things popping up.
People are freaking about. Is Taylor
going to be on New Heights? We&#39;ll talk
about them. Honestly, we&#39;ll probably
find out by that time. So, it&#39;ll be
great. But, I&#39;m so excited for everyone
to hear this interview. Yeah. So, we&#39;re
going to get right into our interview
with Demi Lovado. And then after that,
we will recap our Sunday night. So,
let&#39;s get into it.
We are obsessed with the Batiste dry
shampoo. It&#39;s the award-winning number
one dry shampoo brand, number one in the
US and number one in the world. It
instantly refreshes your hair, absorbs
the oil and grease for a cleaner looking
and feeling hair with added volume and
texture. It&#39;s great on your hair, easy
on your wallet, and you get that blowout
look without the blowout price. Batist
works better than the next leading
competitor and brands that cost up to
two times more. There&#39;s a reason
everybody loves Batiste. There&#39;s a
reason it&#39;s a cult classic. I&#39;m always
going for a little Batiste to judge up
my hair, especially maybe day two, day
three of a blowout where you want to
bring it back to life. Batiste does the
trick for you. Just brings it back.
Looks amazing. Also love that it gives
you a little texture, a little livedin
look, but you lose that oil and grease.
All hair types are welcome. So, you can
buy the Batiste dry shampoo online or in
store at your nearest retailer.
I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;ve ever felt like this
I can&#39;t deny.
It feels so right.
All right, everyone. We are here with a
very, very special guest. A legend needs
no introduction. The one and only Demi
Hello. I don&#39;t know where to look.
This could this it would be this one. If
you have like a really strong point you
want to make right into that camera.
Yeah. Yeah.
Right there.
Get it point.
Y say yeah.
We&#39;re starting with the jokes already.
It&#39;s fine.
That one wasn&#39;t really good.
I&#39;ll probably say some jokes that won&#39;t
be funny, but we&#39;ll pretend to laugh.
Yeah, I&#39;ll laugh at them.
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Thank you so much for joining us. We are
so honored that you&#39;re sitting with us
Thank you. Especially after last night,
healed all of us.
It healed me, too.
So happy to hear that.
Thank you. Yeah, it was so fun.
We We have to ask you about it because
it just was such a moment. I was
watching the videos back again on my
phone when just your name being
announced and MetLife, I thought like
MetLife was going to explode.
How did that reaction sound to you on
stage? I so I actually I&#39;m like a little
nervous Nelly like before every
performance pretty much before like
every podcast like my hands are sweaty
right now
I&#39;m an anxious person so like I get
nervous before everything so I wasn&#39;t
even like I wish I could have um soaked
it in a little bit more but I was so
focused on like what am I singing the
chorus or the verse right now like I was
so um in yeah I was so nervous that like
I was focused on just hitting my marks
and doing the thing that I didn&#39;t really
like soak up the love and also I have in
ears then so you can&#39;t really hear the
crowd as much as you would if you didn&#39;t
have them in.
So um but but seeing everyone and the
reactions and everything just like
filled my soul it with warmth and love.
It was incredible.
Really a dream come true.
You know it really was a dream come true
for us, for everybody there, for
everybody at home watching that wishes
they were a part of the show. So many
people are, oh my god, I&#39;m so
I was at those early tours in, you know,
2008, 2009, like I have been a lot like
we&#39;ve really been fans from the
beginning. So watching you on stage with
them now was just was just so special.
How did it all come to be?
Honestly, Joe just asked me like last
week was like, &#34;Hey, what are you doing
next weekend or on the 10th? um we would
love to have you come and perform This
Is Me and wouldn&#39;t change a thing. You
know, you&#39;ve been like a huge part of
our journey and and vice versa. So, um
he was like, &#34;It this this show is
really important to us and we would love
to have you there.&#34; And
it was so nice and like I said, it was
so healing for me, too. You know, we&#39;ve
been through so much together, all of
us, the Jonas Brothers and I. Um, and it
was really really great to like spend
time with them. It was really cool. They
came to my room, all three of them, and
like spent time getting to know my
husband and which was really meaningful
to me. And they just, you know, thanked
me profusely for flying across the
country to perform with them. And it was
just so thoughtful. I felt so
appreciated. And it was really healing
for us. And I loved it. you know, every
second of it was so great.
Yeah, that is so amazing. And honestly,
thank you to you and both the Jonas
Spellellers for allowing all of us to be
a part of such a special moment because
like you said, I&#39;m sure it is healing
for both of you and having that time off
stage too to talk in your room with your
husband. When Joe initially asked you,
did it take a lot of thought before you
said yes or was it kind of an instant?
No, it was an instant like let&#39;s do
this. Yeah.
Yeah. Because like in this new era of
mine too, like I&#39;m going back to my um
like I&#39;m throwing it back to like the
memes and like some of the things I&#39;ve
been posting have been like really
nostalgic and so this just fit in with
everything that I&#39;ve been doing and on
top of that it&#39;s such a meaningful song
to me. This is me is, you know, my first
big song that I&#39;ve ever had. And so, um,
getting to perform that with them for
the first time in God knows how many
years was just so full circle and so
special and, you know, it was it was
great to see them. That&#39;s what really
like I did have an outof body moment
where I was like it just it it was so
meaningful for you guys but for us too
to watch you in this new era where like
she is thriving and to watch you get to
come out and sing this is me was like
such a crazy I like have chills thinking
of talking about it again. It was like
it was so amazing cuz you people laugh.
It&#39;s camp rock. It&#39;s it&#39;s but it means
so much to our generation and it&#39;s not
just like a kids movie. It means a lot
to us and that song is so powerful
lyrically and I you know that when
hearing you get to say those words again
on stage I was like gh I&#39;m going to cry
again but it was like and then you sang
wouldn&#39;t change a thing which is my
personal favorite and when you do I like
when he was when Joe was like we have
one more I was like oh my god is it
going to be on the like for a second I
thought on the line then I&#39;ll actually
throw myself off the upper deck but
but wouldn&#39;t change I fell over and on
like it was just perfect it was insane
like fully sobbing and And I&#39;m like, &#34;Do
I look insane right now?&#34; But everyone
around me was doing the same thing.
Like, everyone&#39;s crying. And by the way,
you sounded better than ever.
Actually, unbelievable. The mic was on,
you know, like it was it was on. It was
When was the last time you sang that
song on stage?
So, when Joe asked me and I said yes, I
was like, &#34;Fuck, I&#39;m going to have to
relearn this because I don&#39;t remember
the last time that I sang this.&#34; And
like, I definitely don&#39;t remember the
words. So, and once I listened to it a
few times, it all came back to me. But,
yeah, the last time I performed This Is
Me and Wouldn&#39;t Change a Thing may have
been the Camp Rock 2 tour,
which was 2010. Yeah.
And then This Is Me. I think Joe and I
probably performed it in like 2015.
But, um, it&#39;s been a long time.
When you guys were singing each other&#39;s
parts while the other person was
singing, I was like, &#34;Oh my god, they
still know it.&#34;
We finished soundcheck and Joe was like,
&#34;Well, you still got it.&#34;
I was like, &#34;Oh my gosh, their voices
together. It sounds amazing.&#34; But you
did mention in this era of, you know,
going back and going over the internet
memes and all that. We&#39;re loving it. New
song Fast is out. Obsessed. So much fun.
I love music that makes me feel like hot
and sexy, want to dance, and I feel like
this is exactly the vibe you&#39;re going
for. Yes. And with the music video, you
touched on a lot of those past things we
see pop up. The yogurt. Yes. Um.
Yes. And if I were to ask you what your
favorite dish is right now, what would
you say?
A mug.
It&#39;s so good. What kind of inspired you
own these past internet viral moments?
I don&#39;t know. Well, I think it&#39;s just
like this era for me is I&#39;m not taking
myself too seriously. I think every
other era of my life, I&#39;ve written music
for my the albums to be like really
cathartic and therapeut therapeutic and
like I
it was just always such intense and
heavy topics that I was singing about
and I was like I went into the studio
and I was making this I was like trying
to find my sound and I started writing
like really emotional songs and it just
wasn&#39;t resonating because I&#39;m not in
that place anymore. Like I&#39;m not in a
bad place in my life where I need to
write these really intense emotional
songs. I&#39;m happy and I&#39;m in love and
it&#39;s just it&#39;s not that deep anymore.
You know what I mean? Like it&#39;s just
it&#39;s really not. And so I wanted when I
started making we there&#39;s a song called
Frequency on the album and that was the
first song that I came into the studio
with and like that&#39;s when I found my
sound. I was like okay this is there&#39;s
something to this. And I just chased
that with my producer Zone. He&#39;s
incredible. And so the the whole album
is like, you know, even the emotional
songs on the album, like I took a
different approach with my writing. Like
I&#39;ve normally always written from like
it has to be authentic. I had to like if
I mentioned a date in the song, it had
to be real.
And this time around, I was like in the
studio running out of concepts to write
about cuz there&#39;s only so many love
songs and like so many songs about sex
you can write. And so I was running out
of topics and I was like, what if I just
make stuff up and like have fun and like
write from a fictional point of view and
I did and it was really cool. It was a
really cool writing exercise for me. It
got me out of my head and um and so even
some of the emotional songs on the album
are like
they&#39;re they&#39;re coming from me, but it&#39;s
I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just not in that place
anymore where I have to write music from
a deep dark place.
Right. Were you excited to go back into
that like that dance
pop era the EDM like even just
immediately when we first we&#39;ve
obviously heard fast and we did get to
hear two others as well that were
obsessed with.
Oh, thank you.
And I&#39;m just like I&#39;m like we&#39;re back in
the like that it was almost like a
flashback to some of the the songs like
cool for the summer like some of those
where you like you had those heavy beats
or like yes like you can dance to these.
Did you feel that like connection at all
between the eras?
Definitely. I think as an artist that&#39;s
been in the game for as long as I have,
you look you have moments where you take
a look back at your career and you&#39;re
like, &#34;Okay, what worked for me?&#34;
And I&#39;m like, &#34;The rock stuff didn&#39;t
work for me.&#34; And that&#39;s okay. Like, it
was a passion project. And I I went back
to my roots a little bit with, you know,
I grew up listening to in my emo days,
like the rock stuff. And and so I did I
did that as like a passion project, but
this one is like um it&#39;s just it&#39;s more
it&#39;s fun and I I realized what worked
for me was cool for the summer and um
you know these other big pop songs and
I&#39;m like why don&#39;t I just go back to
that and like I&#39;m in it matches my mood,
you know what I mean? It feels like
authentic to where I&#39;m at right now. So,
like I&#39;m just going to chase that. And I
did. And I came up with some really
great songs that I&#39;m really proud of and
I can&#39;t wait for everyone to get their
ears on.
I cannot wait to hear more. We saw a
little snippet of Kiss at the club at
the club and you&#39;re just like dancing,
like letting loose, having fun, feeling
free. I feel like these are what these
songs embody, which I love. And it kind
of, you know, talks about you being
happy in love. Like,
no way.
No way. way. This can&#39;t be happening.
No, they do this.
We&#39;re just talking about my fire as me,
Debbie literally set the fire alarm off.
That&#39;s unbelievable.
Oh my gosh.
Yep. Thank you. We got it.
Yeah, we will.
Yeah, we&#39;ll just make a music video. I
have the stroke.
Don&#39;t mind if we start twerking. Um, no.
I feel like that was insane, but I feel
like these songs embody exactly what
you&#39;re talking about. Happy in love,
feeling free. Is Is it directly
reflective of all of that?
Yes, definitely. Like I&#39;m I&#39;m in a place
in my life now where I feel free and
happy and
um and just like loving life. And that&#39;s
what this music is really about. And
also then I mean there&#39;s a lot of like
sexually charged songs in in the music
too. But like
we&#39;re here for it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it&#39;s just
like about embracing where I&#39;m at
And um
and it it feels really good. It feels
light-hearted. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what I
think is what I&#39;m chasing with this
project is lightheartedness.
Yeah. It&#39;s so much fun. And even
listening to it getting ready in the
morning, I&#39;m like, I want to go dance.
No, I&#39;m just dancing in the mirror.
Loving it.
It really is. And we&#39;re also kind of I
mean, I&#39;m stretching mine out now a
little bit. I&#39;m almost at a year, but we
both also just got married. I was
September last year.
I was April 25th
month after.
Yes. So, we&#39;re all Congratulations.
Congratulations to you.
We&#39;re all wifeies in here. Exactly. And
it feels like we&#39;re all in that era of
just like happy in love, having a good
time, loving life. We want to hear about
your wedding.
You looked absolutely stunning. The
classic Vivian Westwood, a staple,
absolutely gorgeous. We were dying over
it on our show. And also just over you
in general lately. We were talking about
how we just love seeing you live your
life, own the internet, being so happy.
What was the wedding planning process
for you like?
So, I actually started planning, we got
engaged in December of 2023.
Um, and no, 20 I
Okay, forgive me. I&#39;m blanking on the
year, but it was a year and a half
before we got married.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So, um, we got engaged in December and
then I started planning in January
cuz I was like, let&#39;s get this. Let&#39;s
go. I was like, I don&#39;t want to be
stressed. That&#39;s the last thing I want.
Um, and so we started planning early and
we found the venue immediately. Um, we
found all the other pieces of the puzzle
pretty much immediately. And then the of
course it&#39;s stressful like leading up to
the wedding cuz you want everything to
go perfect. you don&#39;t want anything to
be messed up and it&#39;s like is it going
to rain and all these things all these
variables but like um when I say that
the day couldn&#39;t have gone more perfect
like it was everything went right and
all of those all of that stress that I
had accumulated over these like little
thoughts in my head of like what if this
goes wrong what if that goes wrong it
all went away and it was just it was
such an amazing day like I was overjoyed
and just like it was the best day of my
Love to hear that.
I know. It&#39;s so It&#39;s so so beautiful.
Um, how did you meet your husband?
We met in the studio. Studio. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
So, he he&#39;s um an artist himself,
but he&#39;s also a songwriter. And so, he
came in as a songwriter for my um Holy
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] album.
Mhm. Okay.
Yeah. And we wrote a few songs together
on that project.
And you did you know like instantly? Was
I knew instantly, but we we were friends
first. like we really built a friendship
first and you know in the beginning like
I had a crush immediately like I I
literally sat down in the studio and
texted my best friends and was like the
hottest guy just walked in. I was like I
don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m so nervous.
What do I write now? Like I want to
sound I want to impress him. You know
what I mean? Like so um
I had a whole idea for a song. I have to
scrap it cuz I cannot hear it.
Right. Right. Right.
Who made the first move? Um, it was
it was collective. It was like it was
both of us. But, um,
it was a collab.
It was a collab.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, the wedding planning process,
you&#39;re right, it could be stressful, but
when you have that amount of time, it
almost makes it&#39;s like fun cuz there&#39;s
not that much pressure when you have
that much more time in between before
the actual day. What was the guest list
like? You know, like planning who you&#39;re
going to invite, who&#39;s making the cut.
Um, I wanted to keep it as small as
possible. Like I really didn&#39;t want a
300 person wedding. Um,
but I wanted and so I wanted it to be
intimate but I wanted it to like but
they as I was planning I kept being
like, &#34;Oh, but I need to invite this
person. Oh, but I need to invite.&#34; So
the number kept growing. It was fairly
intimate. It was like 140 150 and which
I think was like the perfect size to be
honest. Um, but who made the cut? you
know, it was just like people that are
really important to me and that I that
have been that were a part of our story
and um everyone there plays a part in
our relationship and that&#39;s what we
wanted to celebrate with them.
Yeah. You&#39;re in this this new era like
you said, moving on, laughing about the
past. Where do you think like now in
your 30s it&#39;s like I feel this way after
turning 30 as last year. It&#39;s kind of
like you your circle doesn&#39;t get
smaller, but your friends are so
important and
you learn so much more I think about
friendship at this age too. How do you
think your friendships have evolved in
in this new time? I think over the
years, you know, in my 20s, I had a lot
of acquaintances
and in my 30s I have really good core,
like a really good core group of people
around me.
And I value those relationships more
than my acquaintances because those are
the ones that are going to pick up the
the calls in the middle of the night if
you&#39;re struggling or whatever. You know,
those meaningful relationships, I value
them a lot. And so I think my
friendships have evolved where like I
really just value the core relationships
in my life because I&#39;ll take connection
over anything, over fame, over money.
Like what you have at the end of the day
are the relationships in your life. Your
family, your friends, like that&#39;s the
most important thing in in the world to
me. And um and yeah,
I don&#39;t know if that answers it. I feel
like with core friendships, like you
said, when we as we get older, you
notice your life look a certain way that
when some of those people get removed,
you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, well, my life has been
improving and they&#39;re not in it, so
maybe they didn&#39;t serve me well.&#34;
Yeah. And I think I placed a lot of
expectations on other people in my 20s.
Like, I give a lot in relationships. And
so when I was putting in the effort in
these acquaintances and these
friendships that were kind of su super
superficial and wasn&#39;t receiving that
back, I learned that lesson the hard way
in my 20s because I was just like
here I am like
really trying to be a friend for people
that aren&#39;t reciprocating that. And I&#39;m
just not going to invest my time in
that. like I want people around me that
have my best interest at heart,
you know, and I want people around me
that are going to reciprocate the
connection that I&#39;m um that I&#39;m giving.
And so,
yeah, I think that&#39;s how like the things
that I&#39;ve learned the most about
friendships is like
you kind of there&#39;s different tiers,
right? And
I think you just have to have a good
understanding of where each person in
your life, what tier they fall on. Mhm.
Um yeah,
I feel like a lot of people can relate
to that though, like feeling like you
give a lot to a friend. You don&#39;t feel
it back. You&#39;re like, you know what,
then this friendship isn&#39;t going to
serve me so much. But then you know them
for what they are and you can kind of
keep them at that level, right? Keep
them at that tier. They don&#39;t have to be
at the top, but like
we&#39;re cool. And I have people in my life
like that where I&#39;m like, you know what,
you are here for like
this reason,
for this reason and this season and
that&#39;s fine. Exactly.
Exactly. So true.
I understand. So true. For sure. You&#39;ve
been, you know, very open about the
trials and tribulations of, you know,
the child star life and all those
How have you kind of healed yourself
from from those younger years? you know,
Child Star, the documentary that I did
was um really healing for me because it
made me look back at my upbringing as a
child star and how that affected me and
shaped me into the person that I am
today and
there&#39;s yeah I I learned so much about
myself and so wait what was your
question? No, I was just think that&#39;s
kind of you answered working on the
documentary. I said how you kind of
healed yourself from
Yeah. working on the
documentary label and all those things
that come with it.
It&#39;s just years of therapy. Like I&#39;m in
therapy once a week without fail. I have
been for
probably seven years now. Once a week
and if I&#39;m struggling it&#39;s twice a week.
I I do what I do to take care of myself.
Um, I&#39;ve put in a lot of work and I&#39;ve
healed a lot of my inner child um that
was wounded from growing up in the
and and through other traumas and things
like that. But I&#39;ve worked through that
and and I think that shows, you know, it
shows where I&#39;m at today. Like the
reason why people are like, &#34;Oh, you&#39;re
glowing or this or that is like one, I&#39;m
in love. Yeah. Two, it&#39;s like I&#39;ve done
the work, you know, and I and I will
continue to to do the work because
that&#39;s what this life is about is about
evolution, right?
And you are 100% glowing. I said, we&#39;ve
talked about on this show a ton. We see
it right in front of our face right now.
Like you you have a sparkle about it&#39;s
honestly really beautiful to see. And
you know, you have opened up so much
about mental health and with the
documentary Child, we loved it.
children who are getting involved,
artists. How can they support people
like you?
When I set out to do this film, it was I
was trying to figure that out, right?
Like there&#39;s no manual on how to raise a
child star. You just have to set them up
for success by having a solid foundation
in the family. like family is
everything. Um if they&#39;re coming from an
unstable home, it&#39;s probably likely that
it&#39;s going to be an unstable, you know,
journey for them. And so providing them
with support is really important.
Setting them up financially is extremely
important. A lot of people get taken
advantage of financially as child stars.
And especially now we&#39;re in like the
kind of the wild wild west where there&#39;s
no legislation on social media and
compensation and protection for ch
minors on the internet. And so we have
to like
really take a look at that and
you know legislation always follows
technology. So it&#39;s just inevitable that
we&#39;ll get there.
Um we just and and we are getting there.
Gavin Newsome signed a bill into effect
that you know protects minors and helps
compensate them um online and other
states are following suit. So hopefully
that&#39;ll just become the norm and and
that&#39;s so true now too cuz it&#39;s like the
way it&#39;s evolved it&#39;s like you know we
when we were growing up is we were
watching the kids on Disney Channel but
now it&#39;s kids are watching kids on Tik
Tok who are making all their money on
Tik Tok and doing all those things and
um you really embraced the whole Tik Tok
world which
I&#39;m having so much fun and we can and we
can see that. What kind of made you
think, you know what, I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m
gonna really start posting on this app
and like making jokes and having fun
with old memes, you know, the Disneys,
all those fun things.
Yeah. So, I was like I&#39;m kind of like a
little bit of like what else can I be
doing? You know what I mean? Like I&#39;m
not a workaholic because I really value
my rest time. Um, but like I was just
kind of like what else can I be doing?
And I was posting like my cooking videos
on Tik Tok and was having so much fun
with that that I was like maybe I should
like try some of the trends, you know
what I mean? Like some of the lip
things. Let me just see what that&#39;s
like. And then I did it and I got
hooked. And then I started posting every
day. And sometimes I&#39;d have like more
than one post a day and I&#39; but I&#39;d like
have them and I I just like with my
friends we started making Tik Toks
together like and it just became a
thing. And so once I started posting,
everyone received it well and I was
like, &#34;Wow, this is great.&#34; Cuz I&#39;m
like, I literally just did this to start
having fun on the internet.
No, we and we felt it. It is so much
It&#39;s so much fun to watch. I think
people forget and like I see in the
comments she is an actress, you know?
It&#39;s like forget.
Let&#39;s not forget she she knows it. Do
you ever like kind of get the the the
acting bug again or are you happy in you
know the music the music era? I um love
to act but I my confidence in my acting
is not as strong as my music
and so and I think it&#39;s because I&#39;ve
just done more music and you know when I
started in the industry it was film and
television and music but then it just
ended up turning into music and I spent
so much time away from acting that and
now I&#39;m like oh god am I doing a good
job of like you know I&#39;m really in my
head about it so um
yeah I I definitely get the itch and I
would love to I would actually love to
take lessons more than I have been and
just get into like build my confidence
in acting and then
and then you know do it again. It&#39;s all
there. We know the the the comedic
you had comedic timing. I mean people
like you know we we all watch honey with
a chance like you had amazing comedic
timing. So it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s there. It
would be really fun to see something
like that again.
And it is funny to say but you even see
it in the Tik Toks like you being able
to do the trending audios making fun of
yourself. Like the comedy is all there.
Absolutely. I couldn&#39;t agree more. I
feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s you have to be able
to embrace
all of that, too.
That&#39;s right. And you did go back to the
yogurt shop.
I did.
Were you nervous about that?
No, I wasn&#39;t nervous. I was like, it&#39;s
been so long
and I actually was really excited and
there was fans there. So, like the fan
interaction was really heartwarming to
me. You know, getting to see my fans in
the parking lot like singing fast before
it was even out was just like
so cool. Um, so I wasn&#39;t nervous. I had
a really great time and everyone there
was really accommodating, really sweet.
Um, and you know, they they didn&#39;t have
to welcome me back with open arms, but
they did. And that was really cool.
Everyone was so excited to see that,
especially because honestly, I kind of
forgot about that video for a second and
then when I saw you at the yogurt shop,
I was like, &#34;Oh my gosh,
it all comes back.&#34;
Wow. It all comes rushing back. Yes,
that is so true. Do you do you watch any
of the any of the old stuff? Like are
there times when you&#39;re like, let let me
throw Camp Rock on. And
so I my one of my best best friends um
her name is Libby. She was like, I
actually have never seen Cam Rock 2.
When I told her I was going to do this
with the Jonas Brothers, she was like,
&#34;I&#39;ve actually never seen Cam Rock 2.&#34;
And I was like, &#34;Bitch, we&#39;re watching
it. Like, we have to sit down. Sit the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] down.&#34; And so we she was like,
&#34;Well, we have to watch the first one.&#34;
And so we watched the first one and I
cringed out of my soul, but I loved
every second. And then we watched the
second one the next night and it was so
fun. And like really it was really I
look at Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2 and
even like even my albums they&#39;re all
scrapbooks for me
because I made I had so many memories
from that time and even just on set and
working on that film that when I watch
Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2 back I don&#39;t
just see a project that I worked on. I
see a collection of memories that really
fulfilled me and gave me so much life at
a dark point in my life. I, you know, I
was kind of struggling when I was
working on those projects, but those
projects brought me so much joy. And so
when I watch them back, it&#39;s not just,
oh, this was this movie I was in. I&#39;m
like, it&#39;s like looking at a scrapbook
and but moving. And it&#39;s really really
I love that cuz it takes us back too. I
was I mean I was listening to like full
demi disography
in preparation. And I was so excited and
you know it takes you back to I&#39;m like
listening to to
you forget and I&#39;m like it&#39;s transported
me back to like my eighth grade
boyfriend like not talking to me after
we went to different high schools and I
was like he forgot about me like this
and I just remember it you like every
lyric I&#39;d be like she knows me
and it was so good and I honestly just
saw somebody make a video about this the
other day because like Fran saying like
you listen to don&#39;t forget
I remember filming myself on my laptop
like so seriously. I have the worst
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] voice. No, the worst voice of
all time. And I&#39;m like,
did you forget? And it&#39;s so bad, but
like it really like how you talked about
last night healing you. It does heal the
parts of us inside of us, too. But
somebody made a video being like, &#34;Guys,
Demi gave us this song at 16 years old.&#34;
Like the vocals that you were giving
at that age. And I I&#39;ll actually say I
was 15 because
when I wrote it and recorded it, I was
15. And then my album came out when I
like right before right after I turned
You just have one of the most powerful
voices of our generation. I I totally
believe that. And people really do
always hype you up in that aspect. Like
your voice is
And you were working overtime then, too.
You kind of forget cuz we were kids too.
So it&#39;s like we were just used to what
was coming out. But now looking back I&#39;m
like 2008 200 like it was albums
everywhere.
When you look when you dissect the
timeline of what we were doing as Disney
Channel kids.
It was crazy. It was a movie, an album,
a TV show and a tour
for 3 years straight.
And there was no downtime. Like when I
would have a hiatus from my TV show, I&#39;d
be busy doing promo in Europe for the TV
show or my tour bus would pick me up
from the stage, the sound stage, and I&#39;d
go to do a festival or,
you know, I was just I was constantly
working. And I think that&#39;s also another
protection that people need to put in
place for child actors today and
performers because
when you when you run kids into the
it&#39;s setting them them up for either
rebellion or burnout.
Burnout or both.
And you just can&#39;t do that to a kid.
Yeah. After last night with seeing the
hype around it, everybody&#39;s reaction,
are you sort of like, &#34;Oh my gosh, now
they&#39;re going to want more from me in
this aspect and like Camp Rock and the
Jonas Brothers, all that.&#34; Or you like,
&#34;We could just let it live on that
I think like I think I know what you&#39;re
getting at and I&#39;m not going to say, but
like I
even just like want more videos of you
Okay. Like Yeah. Even I mean I&#39;m coming
from a aspect of like I was dying to see
you sing live like on do on stage like
that again. Like do you think you would
want to get back into touring?
Yeah, definitely. I definitely want to
tour with this album.
So fun. Like just
I have to. It&#39;s It&#39;s going to be such a
party. Like it&#39;s going to be so fun. Um
but I think like yeah I would love to do
more and um I think there&#39;s like it&#39;s a
delicate balance, right? Like it&#39;s not
like I want to live in the past. I want
to like highlight it and acknowledge it
and you know be appreciative of it
but not live there.
Well, I think that&#39;s kind of what your
music video shows in Fast, right?
Because I saw people talking about the
concept of like you&#39;re talking about you
want to go fast but you&#39;re walking
slowly through your past sort of.
Mhm. And I&#39;m like there&#39;s a lot of chaos
surrounding me and I&#39;m unfased by it.
Like if you notice I don&#39;t look at the
camera until the very end of the video.
Um, yeah, that was a that was a fun
video. Yeah, for sure.
What type of prep goes into a video like
that? Because it&#39;s like it&#39;s such a
great strut that you have going.
Oh, thank you. Like it&#39;s I know that&#39;s
such a But my immediate thought was
like, wow,
you got to It&#39;s hard to walk like that,
you know? I I just kind of turned it on.
Yeah. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what got into
me, but I I just started shredding and I
had fun with it. Yeah.
Like I just have it. Okay, guys.
Yeah. Now, we kind of want to wrap on
like a fun topic, which is reality TV.
We know that you love Love Love Island.
Like, we love Love Island. And when we
saw you were talking about it online,
the amount of times we were like, &#34;Can
we get Demi even over Zoom to recap an
episode with us?&#34; Like, all we wanted
She could say, &#34;I want to talk about
nothing else.&#34; She say, &#34;We don&#39;t talk
about my past. Don&#39;t talk about my
future. Don&#39;t talk about my music. Love
Island.&#34; So, we got to talk about it.
You were loving the season. Can we just
get some thoughts about how you were
feeling watching the season? You told us
you&#39;ve watched every UK and US.
Yes. So, I&#39;ve watched every UK, every
US. I haven&#39;t done Australia, but I&#39;m
going to because of you guys.
This season was
it was interesting. I felt like last
season maintained the drama a better.
Like this season was like the drama came
in hot and heavy and then it kind of
like fizzled out a little bit and
it was it was kind of like I remember
watching and being like, &#34;God, where are
they going to go after this?&#34; Like it&#39;s
really climaxing right now in the
beginning of the season.
Yeah. And and I didn&#39;t love that there
weren&#39;t any like
um God, this sounds bad, but like any
like solid couples at the end.
Totally. Yeah.
It wasn&#39;t like last season where it was
we we were confident that we had
multiple couples leaving like in love.
Yes. You know,
I think that&#39;s what we all secretly root
for is like yes, it&#39;s a show that has a
lot of drama and it&#39;s entertaining and
all this stuff, but like
at the heart of it like
we want to see them last. And you see
the way like Leah and Miguel talking
about each other now and you&#39;re like
this is beautiful and we were a part of
it like we shared that
Serena and Cordell like we rooted for
them so hard last year and it was like
oh to see them still together
and everybody want you know I mean
they&#39;ve been through their ups and downs
Molly May and Tommy Fury but
we go off that with season five we&#39;re
like we want to see that in the end.
Yeah definitely. What did you think of
this season of UK? Cuz honestly did you
watch this season?
I didn&#39;t watch the season of UK. I was
so invested in US that I I didn&#39;t watch
it. We&#39;ll get into that. But I&#39;m
starting it today on the plane. On the
plane ride home.
There you go.
It&#39;s a It&#39;s a doozy. It&#39;s a doozy.
Is it? I didn&#39;t hear anything about it
cuz the US all
it does cuz I think the conversation in
America now is like it gets brushed
under a little bit because we&#39;re all
watching US.
It&#39;s not like in those early summers
when not a lot of people were watching
US and everyone was talking about UK.
Now everyone talks about US, but UK the
the guys on the UK pulled some crazy
moves up yet either. I&#39;m still watching
like crazy moves. So it&#39;s it&#39;s worth
watching. Did you have any favorites
from this season of US of US? I mean I
love Amaya. Amaya Papaya. She&#39;s so damn
Getting the zooies
and she was like
I don&#39;t know. There just wasn&#39;t a lot of
drama around her. like I loved it and
she was just like lighthearted to watch
on camera and just like infectious and I
just loved watching her.
So fun. Besides Love Island, are there
any other reality shows that you love?
Um, besides Love Island, yes, I love The
Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.
Yes, you are speaking our language.
Love Vanderpump Rules.
And it just like almost doesn&#39;t get
better than the like initial seasons of
Vanderpump Rules.
True. It&#39;s really good. I just got to
So, I&#39;m watching through like I watched
from season 1 to now and so it&#39;s just
for the first time.
Wow. I&#39;m jealous. I wish I could erase
it all from my brain and rewatch it for
the first time.
So good.
But I love The Housewives.
I&#39;m Yeah.
The Salt Lake City ladies are really
topnotch. They have been Every season
they just give more and more. I think
it&#39;s like good new additions. Yes.
and I watched Mormon Wives.
Yeah, those girls also bring the drama.
They bring the drama, but I I thought it
was kind of like not as good as The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City. And I
can&#39;t help but compare them.
Yeah. Sometimes when you become like a
housewives purist, it&#39;s hard to step
away. Do you like other housewives or is
Salt Lake like your
I&#39;ve only seen Salt Lake?
You got to watch the New Jersey.
Yes. So, I&#39;m like new in the reality TV
game. I&#39;ve been like scripted television
for so long that now for some reason I
just like started watching reality TV
and I&#39;m hooked. And so if you have
recommendations, we welcome you.
Yes. I was going to say like if you want
to go old school, you got to go back and
watch the early New Jersey like is I
think like if you want to go way back.
If you want to go New York and Beverly
Hills is really good.
They are so good. The early seasons all
of those are amazing. If you want to go
like current, what&#39;s on right now,
those girls are out of their minds. And
it is so it&#39;s like what I want from Real
Housewives. It&#39;s not really crazy
serious drama, but it is hilarious what
these ladies like,
well, a woman just threw a party about
narcissists and they all had to read
like all these sayings and like none of
them realiz it&#39;s like this calls coming
from inside the house, you know? Like
none of them were like this party about
us like right.
It was it was
unbelievable television.
So good. And if you want to watch people
flipping tables and just like Italians
screaming on each other.
New Jersey is great because it&#39;s
actually family. Not I mean probably not
great for them but it&#39;s great for us
that it&#39;s real family dynamics. Like you
know a lot of them are actually related
changes things.
Okay. Interesting.
Yeah. Hope we sold you.
Listen if you want to talk any reality
TV with us we could just sit here and
talk reality TV.
Exactly. Next Love Island season,
I&#39;m in here.
for sure.
Recaps for sure.
Um, we are so so excited to hear more
new music from you.
What else can you tease for us because
we did hear
some others. I&#39;m not really sure what we
can talk about. We obvious
knees I just shot the music video for my
second single. My knees were black
because I was dancing so hard.
And I don&#39;t like I
So back into the dancing.
Back into dancing. Back into like Yeah.
It It&#39;s It&#39;s going to be really good.
I&#39;m really excited.
Getting full like major pop star Demi
on the ground like
on the ground on the table on the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] everywhere.
Everywhere. Exactly.
Yeah. Doing it everywhere. Dude.
Yes. Oh my gosh. Well,
I&#39;m I&#39;m getting the vibe.
There was a stripper pull.
can you sold? Can you do it?
I can&#39;t. But you know what? I I made it
look like I could.
Good. I tried on the bachelorette party.
We went on a boat and there was a
stripper pole. Couldn&#39;t. You know what I
mean? Like,
no. But your cousin
I want to take a pole dancing class
though. I think it&#39;s so fair.
I think they&#39;re the strongest. They&#39;re
so strong.
Yes. And it&#39;s so sexy and like
empowering. I I love it.
Exactly. They can like move slow around.
It&#39;s like how are they doing this?
Amazing. No, I remember you know you did
an interview and somebody asked you when
you feel the most confident and you said
when you&#39;re having sex. And I loved that
answer. Like I was like
I can relate.
Yeah. It&#39;s like when you are stripped
down in your barest form
and you&#39;re doing something you want to
do and you&#39;re taking control depending
on what you&#39;re doing
and it&#39;s just it&#39;s empowering and it&#39;s
sexy and
so present.
You&#39;re present. Exactly. You have
nothing else exists in the world. Yes.
I I totally feel you.
Yeah. That&#39;s when I feel the most
and this music along with that.
Yeah. I feel like this whole album is
that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna be. That&#39;s what
we&#39;re going to be getting, which we are
obsessed with. Can&#39;t wait. Can&#39;t wait to
hear more. Can&#39;t wait to see what else

Amazing. amazing interview sitting down
with her, filming Tik Toks, hanging out,
even talking about Love Island.
It was so nice to feel like I&#39;m like h I
hope we&#39;re a safe space.
I know. I I really I felt that way. I
hope she felt that way. Um it was just
such a big deal for her to come into our
studio. So, thank you so much, Demi
Lovato, for joining us. It was amazing.
And obviously goes with Sunday night,
which was the Jonas Brothers concert at
Metife Stadium,
which we know at Jonas Brothers concert
it&#39;s going to be.
A great time no matter what. Of course,
it&#39;s epic.
They were teasing four big surprises.
I And by the way, Big Rob did come out.
That wasn&#39;t one of the four surprises,
but Big Rob did come out,
obviously.
Um OBS, but they were,
you know, teasing all these surprises
and they delivered. Like Sunday night
was a humongous night.
Absolutely. I think the Jonas fans were
obviously all over some of them. Um
there were hopes and dreams for Demi of
but they just put out their new album
Greetings from Your Hometown and we knew
already like Switch Foot was on the
album. They&#39;ve been talking about
Switchfoot a lot. If you follow
SwitchFoot on social, which you know I I
did not, but I was seen it shared a ton
was like, oh, they were posting stories
of them coming to New York and like
being in the city. It&#39;s like, okay, you
probably assume maybe that could be one
of them. Um, which was great. It was
kind of crazy though because they
brought Switchfoot out and they didn&#39;t
play the song from the new album. They
played a Switchoot song and then they
sang Hold On while Switchoot was still
on stage which I like understand but at
the same time I was like yeah from your
hometown you just you didn&#39;t sing it. I
have a feeling that this this whole show
is is going to change not a lot but
Metife was so many guests and so many
like moments that that&#39;s five or six
songs already that they probably are
going to have to put you know their
songs in for their other shows. So it&#39;s
like oh you know you&#39;re not going to
hear a switch. It&#39;s It&#39;ll change of
course, but I was surprised that they
didn&#39;t sing that song.
I think people were thrown off by that.
It is so funny though. They started off
with Love Bug.
The way the way that I was jumping up
and down screaming to Matt, this is
Fran&#39;s favorite song ever. And
no, I truly like I I I was so ready for
the like because the way they&#39;ve been
teasing the I can&#39;t lose on for like
their I can&#39;t lose, but like it&#39;s very
dramatic. They have this built out for
the show and I thought that was a lock
for how they were going to open and when
I heard those opening chords I starting
with Love Bug
shock the world.
I was absolutely I was they did shock
the world. They shocked the world. I
couldn&#39;t believe it. I was like wow I
knew we were in for a show of a lifetime
when they were starting with Love Bug.
I&#39;m like if we&#39;re starting with Love
Bug. And not only did we start with Love
Bug, Sucker was like four songs later.
So I was like, &#34;Wow, they&#39;re changing
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up.&#34; Like they&#39;re not going to have
this be in the encore. Like really a
change from what you&#39;re used to going to
a Josh Brother show, right? I felt that
way. Like the energy was hot right off
the start. Like it was oh my gosh. Like
I I couldn&#39;t catch my breath from the
beginning. And me and you were texting
in our group chat and you were like I
may like stop doing this whole thing. I
was like I am like I feel like a freak
right now. like why am I crying so much
at every you just like meant so much
like Met life
and it was honestly their intro was so
good when they were like talking about
being from New Jersey and then when
when Kevin hit the and I still live in
New Jersey I was like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] yes I&#39;ll get
oh my god New Jersey like it was and
also like being from Long Island but now
living in New Jersey I&#39;m like oh my god
like I feel it guys so No, but it was so
funny because by the way, Nick Jonas,
his quote was getting taken out of
context, which it absolutely should not
be because it was iconic. And I was
like, &#34;Fuck yes.&#34; Nick, when he was
like, &#34;I&#39;m so happy to be Nick Jonas.&#34;
It cuz he was talking about Nick Jonas
from New Jersey.
From New Jersey. And it was such an
amazing moment. It was like what a way
to start the show. The energy was just
all the way at the top. It was
unbelievable. It really It really was.
Um they like I said we it&#39;s so fun going
to the first show obviously because you
don&#39;t know the set list. You don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going to happen.
Metife is so huge. Like it just felt so
special to be there for that experience
just for the guys to be there. Like you
could feel it other than just the way
they they walked out on stage. I love
Joe&#39;s mom&#39;s favorite jean jacket. That
was funny. Um
and they had plenty of surprises. is
like I said, we mentioned Switch Foot
and then they bring out Jesse McCartney,
which really like I think that was not
in any on anyone&#39;s bingo card of like
who&#39;s going to come out of this show.
No, it wasn&#39;t at all. I did not catch
Jesse McCartney whatsoever. And
immediately like I couldn&#39;t even enjoy
Jesse McCartney&#39;s performance because
all of a sudden I started cringing
thinking about us singing. I don&#39;t know
if we could edit that in. Can we edit in
the video of us singing with Jesse
McCartney? Uh, no.
No, because we&#39;re singing.
Yeah, cuz we&#39;re singing the song.
Okay. Yeah. So, we can&#39;t. But, um,
and you&#39;re welcome for that cuz you
really don&#39;t need you don&#39;t need to
But for our new listeners who don&#39;t
know, we used to do a show on SiriusXM.
That&#39;s how Tricks in the Office started
we had Justin McCartney on early on 2018
the ball&#39;s on us to sing his song. I do
not have those castas any longer. Like I
the balls to at the end of it be like,
&#34;Yo, keep singing.&#34; And he was like, &#34;I
think we&#39;ve heard enough.&#34;
Yeah. Yeah. And keep going. Yeah. No, we
sang Beautiful Zo with him. It was not
No. Terrible. But that&#39;s immediately
where my brain went where I was like, I
can&#39;t even enjoy this moment right now.
Because you know when you remember when
you did something that&#39;s really
embarrassing and I was like, &#34;Oh my god,
I&#39;m cringing out of my body.&#34;
But not embarrassing enough to where I
didn&#39;t post it on my story. Because I
was like, &#34;Wait, I actually do have to
share this on my Instagram story because
it&#39;s that crazy.&#34; But it was so
exciting. Like how nice for Jesse
McCartney.
No, I the whole time I was thinking like
Jesse McCartney highlight of his life.
just any opportunity to perform in a in
a stadium like that. I felt the same way
even with All-American Rejects.
They opened um they were great
and obviously you know they have smash
hits and they&#39;ve never played in a in a
stadium either, he said. Um,
so that was really amazing to to see
that. And he was being his full his full
self like he&#39;s he&#39;s kind of a he&#39;s you
know kind of a weird guy. Yeah. 100%.
I was crying laughing because he was
like he pointed out a group of girls on
on the floor and they were all in red
but he was like what&#39;s going on here?
Like why are you all in red? Like are
you guys like about to form some human
heart? like like what kind of hands
handmade tail shit&#39;s happening over here
like whatever. And obviously we all know
you know the red dresses but obviously
he does not know the lore of the red
dress. Um
so there were some some funny moments
like that but the show is great. It&#39;s
going to be It&#39;s interesting because
it&#39;s hard to like build out a stadium
show that opens as a stadium show but
will continue on in smaller venues, you
know, because
there were so many people there and I
think you get every fan on the spectrum.
You get the casual fan, the super fan,
like you get all across the board. So,
for the moments, there were some moments
where they played some, you know, deep
cuts, which I appreciate and love, but
it&#39;s in like a stadium. It&#39;s crazy
because I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh my god, I can&#39;t
believe we&#39;re hearing uh like Joe&#39;s solo
first solo album songs at [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Medlife, which is awesome for them.&#34; But
you could you could definitely tell the
audience was like, &#34;We don&#39;t know these
ones.&#34; Like Nick Jones is he&#39;s hitting
some a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Throw some bacon on it and
everyone&#39;s like, &#34;What did he just say?&#34;
Yeah. They were That was a show for
them. Yes. You know what I mean? Like
they were having a good time.
I&#39;m saying when they go to do all the
rest of the tour, like people are going
to lose their [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] over those moments
and like I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll maybe they&#39;ll
change it. They&#39;ll do other songs. I
also was crying laughing when they did
they did a gender reveal.
Yep. and she was from Brazil and they
did a gender reveal and they were asking
for a request which is definitely their
something they&#39;re gonna incorporate um
at other stops as well
Joe had asked you know what song would
you like to hear and she said when you
look me in the eyes and she&#39;s like he
was like oh you know I promise you&#39;re
going to hear that one later and then
her next suggestion was pizza girl
that was she went oh then okay when no
way he looked me in the I&#39;ll go pizza
And here comes Sheena.
And they were like wrote her new book.
Crying, laughing cuz they&#39;re and they&#39;re
on stage being like, &#34;Yeah, you know,
um, got anything else?&#34;
Yeah. That that I was like, &#34;Okay, wow.
Honestly, don&#39;t ask for a request if
you&#39;re not going to just play what they
want to hear.&#34;
I know.
I&#39;m so sorry. Like, give me one more.
And then she was went um, &#34;Still in love
with you.&#34; Which is obviously crazy.
Summer. Oh, summer baby. Sorry. The
other one was Still in Love with You
Summer Baby. And then they did Still in
Love with you. But even still, I think
like I think in their minds whenever
they do requests, they expect it to be
something from those first couple albums
and that&#39;s probably what they&#39;re
prepared for because even when she said
Summer Baby, they were like, &#34;Ah, shit.&#34;
Okay. Uh, let&#39;s try.
Yeah. I feel like Nick was like, &#34;Okay,
I got I got this one, guys.&#34;
Yeah. Yeah. You know, um, but it was so
fun like hearing the the solo stuff and
got some Nick Johnson and the
administration thrown in there. Um,
No one was happier than Nick Jonas was
up on that stage. Like I could just tell
from his vibes immediately he was
living his best life, which of course
you were, but I was like he is like on
stage at Metife. He is so [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happy
right now.
Are we going to talk about the
like arm off Joe and Nick were having
where it was like who had the better
Yeah, they they got to do that.
Joe popped the top and then Nick popped
the top and I was like no complaints.
Yeah. None. Zero. They looked fantastic.
And they looked so all three of them
really looked so handsome.
They looked so good. And it&#39;s it&#39;s so
funny because like I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve only
been to Jonas Brother show Jonas Brother
shows with you or like other girls.
So when we got invited this week and you
already had tickets and I was like okay.
I was like Matt you want to go? He was
like yeah I&#39;ve never seen the Jonas
Brothers. The way that I was like
screaming like oh my god they&#39;re so
sexy. And he was like he was like yeah
honestly like they&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up there.
And I was like I was like you just you
had to ride and he was he when Joe did
one move during Cake by the Ocean like I
don&#39;t know what happened but like he was
like on the ground it it seemed like he
impregnated the the audience.
No for sure.
Matt popped out of his seat. He was
like, &#34;Joe is a sick puppy.&#34; And I was
like, &#34;They are they know what
sounds coming out of my mouth at those
times that I don&#39;t even, you know, you
have no control over,
right?&#34; They&#39;re like, &#34;They know what
we&#39;re here for.&#34; And it&#39;s for them to be
a little [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on stage and pop the
tops and sing their hearts out and look
cute and handsome, but at the same time,
sex appeal.
They know what they&#39;re working with.
Yeah. I mean, they were doing those
their little disco time to talk dance
moves. I like, &#34;Oh my god, these two
these guys, man, they did.&#34; And then
when they when they came out after the
marshmallow intermission and they had
their jackets back on, I was like, &#34;Ah,
come on, guys.&#34;
Yeah. No, that&#39;s when you realize like
you started being sick in the head.
Yeah. Cuz you&#39;re like, &#34;I have like an
outfit change.&#34;
But don&#39;t worry, Joe. Joe, don&#39;t worry.
Joe had to make sure he got down to that
burning up tank top by the end of the
marshmallow.
I will support the brothers.
And all that they do.
The marshmallow set felt out of place.
Can we agree?
No, I&#39;m actually gonna disagree with you
on it.
because because I also I just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
love that music,
too. That was great music. No, I I like
I and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my B. I don&#39;t
know what if it&#39;s just in me to never
like it&#39;s I&#39;m not going to
I think you just refuse to like
No, but I will say I will say like I
really actually enjoyed cuz it felt it
didn&#39;t feel too long to me. It was like
all right. And and it was a good time
for everybody to kind of take a take a
you know,
you know, go to the bathroom.
It was definitely a good time to take a
No offense to Marshmallow, you know, but
that was like that was everyone&#39;s
That&#39;s what I mean, though. That&#39;s what
that&#39;s why.
But you know what I&#39;m saying? They have
to do
something then. I mean, I guess they
could just literally play music and have
nothing on the stage.
No, they No, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re You&#39;re
right. I just was like, &#34;All right,
boys. Let&#39;s get on with the show.&#34;
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean?
The first half was also so good, too.
That&#39;s why that&#39;s why like when it hit
that point, I was like, &#34;Wait, come
back, brothers. Come back on stage.&#34; I
think that&#39;s like you&#39;re just yearning
for them to get back out there. And then
they came back. heard a little avichi
from Marshmallow. I was like, &#34;Okay,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you.&#34;
Yeah, I was vibing. I was like, &#34;Okay,
I&#39;m vibing.&#34; But like, brothers, come
back out. Because they were teasing all
these surprises and you knew there was
more surprises, so you were like, &#34;Wait,
come back out.&#34; And boom, they hit us
with the biggest surprise of all
when they played
those snippets. Yeah. From Camp Rock.
Nick&#39;s whole Disney speech.
Oh, I have chills again.
I know. When Nick went into the Disney
speech, I was like, &#34;Oh, boy.&#34;
About how
could it be?
Yeah. and Joe, you know, auditioned and
then the brothers got involved and it&#39;s
like quiet and everyone&#39;s like waited
with their breath like what&#39;s about
really everyone everyone was standing
but you know everyone was on the edge of
their seat
being like is this actually going to
happen right now
right and then they started showing a
lot of demi clips in that camp rock
and then ladies and gentlemen Demi
and she hits the stage looking so
and the vocals sounding unreal.
Vocals better than ever. Like
unbelievable.
The bridge on Wouldn&#39;t Change a Thing.
Oh my god.
So good. And obviously Wouldn&#39;t Change a
iconic. The fact that they did that was
such a treat.
It really was. They didn&#39;t have to feed
us like that. She could have come out
and just did This Is Me and everyone
would have lost her [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and be good.
But when Joe was like, &#34;Let&#39;s do one
more.&#34; I was like, &#34;Oh my god.&#34; For a
second, I thought they were gonna I
said, &#34;This is dummy. I thought they
were gonna do On the Line.&#34; Yeah. which
actually would have been insane, but
wouldn&#39;t change a thing is it&#39;s so good.
Such a good song.
But the fact that she like This Is Me is
also like I go back and forth on which
one because This Is Me is just such like
I know staple. You would never think you
would hear Demi sing or Joe sing ever
again in our lives. Like we just thought
there&#39;s no way there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll ever
see this ever again. Seeing Joe and Demi
walk down the catwalk together
and like turn and sing at each other. I
was having an out-of- body experience
riding a bike
really cuz it&#39;s like I really never
thought I would see this happen again.
You know, it&#39;s just
it&#39;s it there&#39;s there&#39;s been so much so
much life so many things that you&#39;re
like, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s probably not going to
happen.&#34; And to see it happen, it&#39;s just
like we said in the interview, you guys
heard it was a healing experience for
all of us. It really felt I was like,
&#34;Oh my god, I like
seeing them together again healed
something in all of us.&#34;
It really does. And it and it sounds
cheesy or whatever it is, but the
feelings that we have and that everybody
listening can relate to right now of
seeing and hearing that, you can&#39;t
really describe them. Like it just it
it&#39;s so nostalgic. It brings you back to
those like times as a child and
I it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to put into words
because it really was a special moment
for everybody and hearing Demi talk
about how it really was a healing moment
for them too.
Um just makes us even feel more
fulfilled and it&#39;s almost like oh we can
close a chapter for sure like no 100%.
it as a as a as a fan and like somebody
and I know so many girls also have like
obsessed over this over the years
thinking about it. It&#39;s a moment that
you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, you know, we&#39;ve all
grown up.&#34; You you know what I&#39;m saying?
Like it&#39;s it feels like you know what?
The past is the past. Look at we&#39;re
we&#39;re on stage together. We&#39;re all
right. You know, it&#39;s really nice.
And it reminds you of simpler times for
us as a child, but like not simpler
times for them. Yeah.
You know, like that&#39;s like when you&#39;re a
child watching me. Yeah.
It&#39;s just like us.
My necklace my necklace was [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up
that whole time. Did you notice?
No, I didn&#39;t notice that at all.
Um, sorry.
Uh, it&#39;s just unbelievable. Like, I
couldn&#39;t I literally couldn&#39;t believe
she was actually coming out when when
the montage started playing cuz I was
like, don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re just going to
like the cast of we we saw the cast of
Camp Rocket Jones. Right. Right.
You know, like Yeah. Yeah, we had a ton
of fun.
Yeah. And it was amazing. But we need
Demi in this.
But it was like, right, cuz the way they
were teasing, I was like, oh no, they&#39;re
singing something, which means there&#39;s
only one person that
could come out with them and just
knock it out of the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] park the way
that they did.
And I didn&#39;t try to think about any
possibilities of who it who the spies
could be. Like I feel like we let
ourselves be surprised for the whole
night because
I know really like the like Dean Lewis
also came out saying the new song like
those are the ones I was like okay they
have some features on the new album
those are people probably see
you get your hopes up obviously oh could
Demi be coming out
right you see every Tik Tok comment
Miley Demi it&#39;s like
you&#39;re like could it be Justin McCartney
never would have crossed my mind like it
was just
just 10 out of 10 like the vibes were so
high and then coming home
knowing like after Okay, so Demi comes
out, right? And we&#39;re like, &#34;Holy fuck.&#34;
Demi just came out of the Jonas Brother
show and we&#39;re we get to talk the first
to interview her tomorrow. Like
this is not adding up. Like is this is
this the case? Like I couldn&#39;t sleep. I
could not sleep.
I think I went to bed at like two I I
was I was up so late. I was I put Camp
Brock on when I got home.
That&#39;s amazing. I ordered Domino&#39;s and I
w and I clicked that I pressed that
Disney Plus button on my TV. I said,
&#34;All right.&#34;
that&#39;s the only way.
It really was. It really felt like the
only way. I was like, &#34;This is the only
way I&#39;m ever going to potentially make
my way to get some sleep.&#34;

That moment was amazing and then I I
kind of had a feeling that there would
be some sort of family
moment of course and they, you know,
they brought Big Rob out for Burning Up,
which is always amazing. And then they
did Please Be Mine,
first song ever. So they played that
clip and then they sang that which was
awesome. And then they brought out the
family, Mama Jonas, Papa Jonas, Frankie.
They all came out for When You Looked Me
in the Eyes. And like midway through the
song, Danielle and the girls came out.
And it was so special. I cuz tears were
streaming down my face because not only
was the moment so special, but whenever
Papa Jonas opens his mouth and and and
sings a little tune, my god, it takes my
breath away.
Like I burst into tears every time.
Because like he just has this like his
voice is just amazing. So tell me that
you love me.
Everything&#39;s all right. It sounded just
like that. Sounded just like that. Um,
and it just rips me apart from the
inside really. And
having, you know, Kevin&#39;s girl sitting
with him on the piano bench and seeing
it, honestly, seeing so many people on
stage tearing up too and taking in the
moment. I was full of waterworks. It was
so cute, so sweet. Especially at Metife
when you just think about them starting
in New Jersey and when they whenever
they mention like, oh, 20 minutes down
the road, like it&#39;s
really is insane in 20 years. It&#39;s like
I mean
I&#39;m not one to be like I&#39;m old but when
I hear that I&#39;m like oh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like 20
years like that&#39;s actually insane.
But what a what an amazing moment for
them to be like wow 20 years and and
we&#39;re performing Metife for 20. Like
that still shows that you still got it.
Yeah. You brothers still got it.
You know and like like they said on
stage they&#39;re like hey you&#39;ll keep us
for this is just the beginning around
for another 20. We&#39;ll keep we&#39;ll keep
doing it. Mhm.
Did you see the Paul merch?
They&#39;re leaning in.
Yes, they&#39;re leaning. There was a lot of
There was a lot of joke merchandise,
which is I did buy a red dress t-shirt.
I didn&#39;t see I wanted to go look at the
Like before the show and the merch I was
near I don&#39;t think was the good the good
good because I saw a lot of t-shirts and
stuff that other people got that I
didn&#39;t see at all.
Yep. Um I also definitely missed out on
the good merch. Um, however, I am am
sick in the head and like can&#39;t leave a
Jonas Brothers show without merch.
The red dress one is
No, I know. Like there were other
t-shirts and then there was like the
East Rutherford one that was just for
the Metife show that was sold out the
when I finally got to wherever you know
where I got the other shirts and um the
selection was not amazing when I got up
there but I you better believe I was
like I&#39;ll take that one that one and
that sweatshirt. Yeah. And the and and I
came back to the um we were in a box
with my my Jonas gals which was which
was also by the way so amazing because
the last time you know we love going to
shows together but we all live in
different places and the fact that we
all get together for these shows is so
fun and just knowing that I have these
girls for these moments. You know we&#39;ve
had weddings, babies all since, you
know, the last tour. So, it&#39;s just so
crazy that we all like got to see each
other and be like, &#34;Oh my god, you got
married. I got married. You had a kid.
You had a kid.&#34; Like, it&#39;s just like it
was really, really, really so fun. But
they were laughing because I was like,
&#34;Oh, I wanted this much. This I came
back with all things that I was like, I
don&#39;t know. I just had to I was like, I
had to buy it. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m like,
you lose sight of that.
It&#39;s just where it is.&#34; Um,
but they did put the East Rutherford
t-shirt on uh online and you better
believe I pass. pre-sale doesn&#39;t ship
till like the end of August. But I was
like, I I don&#39;t care. You&#39;ll get that.
Exactly. Because everyone like Clara
kept being like, &#34;Friend, you can order
some of these online.&#34; Like, and I was
like, &#34;It&#39;s not the same.&#34;
Yeah. You gotta get We got to go home
with it. Wear it that night.
I know. There&#39;s just something about it.
It&#39;s just not the same. Which I did.
Slept in my in my new t-shirt. Um they
also were making shirts that Claire and
I have to buy. I don&#39;t know. They were
They didn&#39;t have the right sizes online,
but when they come back in stock, we&#39;ll
be getting them. Shirts that say I can
lose when I&#39;m with And then the arrows.
Oh, that&#39;s so good.
So good. Oh, that&#39;s perfect.
So good. So, they made made they made
those ones, too. But just a beautiful,
beautiful night.
It really was a beautiful night. I was
laughing because
when Debbie was coming out, like Matt
took out his phone to film my reaction,
which is honestly, he&#39;s on it. You know
what I mean? Like, you don&#39;t even got to
ask him. Like, he&#39;s like, I&#39;m I&#39;m on it.
He works, man. He knows, but he&#39;s just
so he&#39;s supportive. He&#39;s like, you know
what? He&#39;s like, I&#39;m a fan of the
brothers. So, I&#39;m like, hell, I was
going to say, what what was his thoughts
at the end of the show? you know, he
loves that kind of music anyway.
I know he does, but he&#39;s not really like
a big like he doesn&#39;t go to a lot of
concerts. But, um, he loved it. He was
like, he was like, &#34;They are
performers.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Hell yeah,
they are.&#34; Um, he he got the Jonas
Brothers high, you know, like you&#39;re
just like, &#34;Oh my god.&#34; Um,
honestly, he would fit in so well as
like a really funny sketch of like a
fifth Jonas Brother.
I We were talking about that yesterday
and he was like, &#34;I look more like I
could be a brother than Frankie does.&#34;
I honestly
like Yeah. Um, I do think Frankie and
Kevin look alike though. Um, but I was
like, &#34;You could be like the tall Jonas
Brother, you know?&#34; Um, but it was funny
because he was filming my reaction to
Demi coming out
and I and I just uploaded it so fast,
like I barely even watched the video. I
was just like, I I need to get like this
is epic.
And then I saw someone comment like, &#34;We
want to see the stage, not Ria.&#34; And I
went back and looked at the video and I
was like, &#34;Oh my god, Matt, you like
barely filmed Demi on the stage.&#34;
Right. Right.
He was like he was about it was filming
you about you and I was like that&#39;s so
sweet but like
I want to see Demi but people want to
see Demi but thank you for your POV
because now I don&#39;t have a video of Demi
on that stage. But it was there there&#39;s
some good shots in there was and it was
a good video but I was laughing when I I
saw someone comment that and I was like
wait what? And I went back and watched
and I was like uh-huh I got it now. It&#39;s
just me saying
amazing. Um no but I&#39;ll I&#39;ll cherish
that forever and that moment literally
forever and this day forever. the fact
that we left and knowing that we&#39;re
coming in to interview Demi today and
then I took an Uber to work today on the
radio. They were talking about Demi and
Joe singing on stage last night. It was
the first thing that was on the radio
when I got an Uber. They were like and
Demi Lovado and Joe Jonas sang on stage
for the first time and I was like and
I&#39;m on my way to interview Demi Lovato
like what? It took everything in me not
literally tell strangers on the train on
the way because I
leaving MetLife. If you guys are from
the area, you know it&#39;s a massive pain
in the ass. So, everyone that I was with
like we all live in different places
now. So, it&#39;s like I was I was the only
one going back to Manhattan. So I was
like, I&#39;m get I&#39;m getting on the train
and Claire was with me to the first leg
to Sakus. But then, you know, she peeled
off and then I took the train back into
the city
and I&#39;m just like, you know, sitting on
my in my seat and actually was very nice
girl sat. She was like, &#34;Oh, can I sit
here?&#34; And she sits down and then she
like looks at me and she&#39;s like, &#34;Wait a
She&#39;s like, &#34;Are you Fran or do you just
look like Fran?&#34; I was like, &#34;Nope,
that&#39;s me.&#34; I was like, &#34;That&#39;s me.&#34; And
I&#39;m just like on the train by myself
watching my videos back and everything
just listening to everybody talk about
the show and talk about Demi.
I the way I wanted to stand up from my
seat in the middle of the car and be
like Demiy&#39;s going to be on Chicks in
the Office tomorrow. Everybody listen
up. Listen up. Just you know any new
list chicks in the office podcast?
Follow it. Demy&#39;s going to be on it. I
know you&#39;re all excited.
First interview after this big moment.
No, I felt the same exact way. There
were some lovely listeners, listeners of
ours that were at the box next to us and
um the way that I wanted to tell them so
that she was coming on the show today
and I I like went to turn to do it at
one point and I was like, &#34;Don&#39;t turn.&#34;
I was like,
Like, &#34;What is wrong with you? Do not
spoil this moment.&#34; We sent out a mass
email to our office being like do not
spoil this. Do not talk about this.
Meanwhile, I&#39;m at the concert like got a
pretty big guest tomorrow. Like
how I felt. But no, it was just such a
fun night. So happy for them. Um
Oh, and there&#39;s some other shows
hopefully. I got to look at this the
sketch again.
There&#39;s little like Easter eggs like oh
dream guest like takes the office like
haha or uh oh should I bring back the
girls room?
So silly.
So silly. People are like, &#34;Yes, bring
back the girls.&#34; Like, &#34;Duh. This is for
Demi. This is for [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] probably not
going to come back because we can&#39;t
usually use people&#39;s music.&#34;
Yeah. Granny&#39;s. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. We
had to go. We had to get that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah. Yeah. So, um, not sure I&#39;m
actually bringing it back, but we&#39;ll
form. Uh, but I&#39;m like I&#39;m like
literally giggling at my phone like they
don&#39;t even know. But I&#39;m so bad at this
where I&#39;m like, can I tell them right
I know. I know. Same. I feel the same
way. But no, we had abs such a fun
nightming. Loved it. And like I said, um
I know for everybody else that&#39;s going
to shows, get ready. I think they&#39;re
going to be so much fun. I think it&#39;s
going to be like I you know, there&#39;s a
lot of guests. So, you know, Beautiful
Soul, the Switchoots, Switch Foot stuff.
Obviously, Demi like they&#39;ll there&#39;s
openings for other songs to be played.
And I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll switch it up a
little bit and have some in that song
battle. Maybe they&#39;ll do some new ones,
too. Or not new ones, old ones that they
never really do on tour, which will be
really fun. I&#39;m excited to see how that
all plays out for them on the tour.
The vibes are always good after John&#39;s
post concert. But they are
even better when Demi Lovado comes out
and surprises the entire world and then
ends up in our studio the next day. So,
Thank you very much.
Absolutely. That wraps it up.
Yeah, that that that sums it up.
Yeah. Jake&#39;s in the office. Uh long time
It&#39;s a first time caller.
Look at the charts. Who does it? Two
chicks getting paid in reality checks.
You can find them at the gym. It&#39;s not
even a
