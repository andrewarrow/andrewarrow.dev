Brian, check out how the top Republican
contender for the New York Governor&#39;s
race was received at a recent event.
Liberal Tears is brought to you by PDS
Our Congresswoman from New York 21,
Elise Stefani.
[Applause]
the words they&#39;re screaming there a
traitor traitor over and over again. So
Stefonic was at an event in Platsburg,
New York. It&#39;s she was honoring some
local Republican political leader who
had passed away. Uh folks might remember
that Stefonic was briefly selected to be
the US ambassador to the United Nations
before Trump pulled the nomination
because they were worried that
Republicans would not be able to hold
onto her seat.
Well, that shows you why. Uh, like we
said, Elise is apparently about to jump
into the New York governor&#39;s race. Seems
like she&#39;s got a lot of wind in her
sales, Brian. Huh?
Yeah. You know, the the interesting
thing about that is that we have watched
these these like nakedly shameless
Republican operatives, just do whatever
they have to do to cling to power, to
gain proximity to power in Washington.
And that&#39;s what Lee Stefan did. Like,
she came in as this as this super
She&#39;s a moderate.
Yeah. And now, I mean, she is so far up
Trump&#39;s ass that she could touch the
back of his teeth. And so,
it goes to show that the more that you
align yourself with these people who
position themselves completely
antithetically to what they promised
during the campaign, promised lower
prices, promised uh that they would
release the Epstein files, promised that
they would end wars, promised they would
lower inflation, not doing any of those
things. But the voters are pushing back
on these people who just clung to power
by any means necessary, discarded every
shred of their dignity in doing so and
then thought that they would be well
positioned when they got out on the
campaign trail to seek higher office.
This is what it looks like when those
people get out there.
This is what it looks like when you go
full MAGA and then try to run statewide
in New York. Yeah. Voters are pissed
about Trump&#39;s big, beautiful bill and
all the Medicaid cuts within it. They&#39;re
furious about the lack of transparency
around the release of the Epstein files.
remember uh Republicans left Washington
early to go on recess to try to avoid a
vote on the Epstein files and yet still
this is voters are not letting it go and
apparently even like the Clinton County
Republican party is mad at Stefonic
because she&#39;s trying to ram through some
local candidate and not let voters have
an actual say. So nothing&#39;s going well
for her here.
Well, I mean look, she&#39;s going to need
uh need all the help that she can get
now running in New York. But I uh I I
I&#39;m I&#39;m very very interested to see what
the closest MAGA acolyte running in New
York, one of the big blue liberal
bastions in America is going to do. Uh I
think this is a good preview of what
that&#39;s going to look like.
Very very excited. Uh Brian, speaking of
hecklers, uh check out this clip of Vice
President JD Vance at Union Station
earlier today in Washington DC.
Oh, look.
It&#39;s couch
You going to the couch, buddy?
Couch. Go a couch, JD Vans. Go
a couch.
Is it Is it a good thing when when when
the most viral clip of you walking
through a train station is are you going
to a couch, buddy?
Is that what is that the optics that he
wanted when he walked through uh Union
I I I know it&#39;s juvenile. It just makes
me so happy because JD Vance, he&#39;s at
Union Station. For those who don&#39;t know,
it&#39;s just a big train station in
Washington DC. You can get the Amtrak.
You can catch a bus to New York. I used
to take the uh the Chinatown buses
because they&#39;re very cheap. Uh you can
take the metro there. And like he&#39;s
there with uh Pete Hexath, Secretary of
Defense, and Steven Miller, the terrible
troll who works in the White House. And
they&#39;re trying to convince voters that
we need the US military guarding the
shake shack at Union Station.
Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s just the whole thing
is they keep putting themselves in
positions, and this is very similar to
what Elise Stefonic did. these deeply
unpopular people are going who espouse
these deeply unpopular positions keep
thrusting themselves in front of voters
who are making it abundantly clear that
they don&#39;t want them there and it&#39;s and
it&#39;s this weird strategy where you know
Trump used to insulate himself at these
rallies where it&#39;s only Trump fans and
he would only be surrounded by people
who who um lavish onto him you know uh
uh this this this undying praise and
devotion and and this is what it looks
like we&#39;re seeing more and more of what
it looks like when these people are
confronted by the people who actually
don&#39;t support them. And it is a little
bit chilling in a way because I think
that this defiance at the hands of these
Trump administration officials and these
Republicans is going to show that it&#39;s
it&#39;s not even about the optics anymore.
It&#39;s just kind of about um um imposing
their power on these people that they&#39;re
not even trying to hide it. They&#39;re
they&#39;re putting them they&#39;re thrusting
themselves right in the middle of these
population centers that don&#39;t want them
that are pushing back on them and they
don&#39;t seem to care even about getting
good optics. It&#39;s just about kind of
imposing themselves on these people who
are roundly rejecting them.
Yeah. I mean, look, we live here in Los
Angeles, so we&#39;ve had our own experience
with troop deployment for absolutely no
reason. Like, there were no protesters
like 3 days after these troops were
deployed, and yet they were these poor
guys and men and women were just like
sleeping on the ground outside in Los
Angeles for weeks and weeks and weeks
for no reason at all. Now, Trump has
deployed the troops to the streets of DC
where there is a crime problem, but all
the neighborhoods that these National
Guard members and ICE guys and FBI
agents are going to are the low crime
areas. Like, they&#39;re going to monuments
and stuff.
You think uh you think uh policing uh
drunk sority girls in Georgetown is not
where we need ICE?
Yeah, exactly. You like FBI agents
walking around the bars near Georgetown?
It&#39;s just absurd. Um and I have to say
screaming couch is it is it gonna
win us the election? Is it going to make
I I kind of think that is the right
tone. Like I think mocking these people
and we&#39;re seeing that to a degree with
Newsome. It&#39;s like this this don&#39;t give
a energy. And I and I think that we
need that because Democrats are often so
careful and unoffensive and circumspect
and and and we have to make sure that
every message is poll tested for six
days before we can even start to roll it
out. And it&#39;s just so sanitized and like
who cares? Yell whatever you want. You
know, a lot of people are that that are
watching this right now are going to
have the same feelings about Tim Walls
in the beginning of the 2024 election.
It&#39;s like he was just being a normal guy
and saying what a lot of people like
would also say about JD Vance and Trump,
which is that they&#39;re weird. And that
kind of went away. And I think we have
to get that back that like it&#39;s okay to
say whatever you&#39;re feeling without
feeling like it has to be run through uh
you know some sanitization machines so
that so that it offends the least amount
of people possible.
Yeah. we don&#39;t have to uh sanitize it
for a focus group. I want to talk about
Gavin Newsome in one second, but
finally, Brian, I just wanted to show
you my favorite political heckling video
of all time. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve seen
this. This is kind of like an internet
1.0 video. This might have been on
Ebomb&#39;s World back in the day. I don&#39;t
really know a lot about this individual.
He seems like a younger guy. Um he
there&#39;s but this one lone heckler
destroyed the roll out for a Toledo
mayoral candidates like announcement
press conference and it is so funny to
me that I can never stop watching it.
Well, we&#39;re here today at Parkwood
for uh this the street that my uh mother
actually grew up on down the street.
bad food.
Hey, make sure you guys get that camera
right there.
Are you done?
No, I&#39;m going to eat.
Okay. All right. So, the guy&#39;s yelling,
&#34;Boo, boo, Ben Kab. Boo, Ben Kab.&#34; And
and this guy Ben Kab, he was running for
mayor in Toledo. That was his
announcement press conference. I think
he was trying to like go to the street
where his mother grew up. And there was
one dude who was just sitting on the
porch at his own house. He was just
chatting. Look, if you ever
underestimate the power that a single
person can have, this is
one sandwich thrown, one couch
It was It was one It was one man that
stood in front of those tanks in Tianaan
Square and it was one man who took down
uh what&#39;s it
and you too watching out there, you can
make a difference.
So, actually, this video went so viral
that I think South Park actually spoofed
it in an episode of one of their 27
seasons. The good news is Ben Kop went
on to serve as Lucas County, Ohio
Commissioner. Apparently, he was like a
champion for animal rights. He went on
to work at the CFPB in Washington. So,
he seems like a good guy.
No, I feel bad.
No, he seems like a good guy who did
good work. But I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s just a
classic video there. Liberal Tears is

we&#39;ve talked about Gavin a little bit at
the top. Like that the hottest account
on the Twitter streets right now is
many people are saying
right here in California. That&#39;s right.
Uh at .gov press office, that&#39;s
California Governor Gavin Newsome&#39;s new
troll account, I guess, is the best way
to describe it, which is enraging
Republicans all across the country. Uh,
let&#39;s watch a clip from Fox News.
Gavin Newsome, meantime, posting this on
X, Liz, using all capitals, of course,
trying to mock Trump. Use Trump style.
He&#39;s been doing this for a while now. He
says, quoting, &#34;Chump Trump just fled
the podium with Putin. No questions,
nothing. Total low energy. The man
looked like he&#39;d just eaten three
buckets of KFC with Vlad. Admit it,
Donnie Jay, you&#39;re terrified because
this was the worst week of your life
because of me, Gavin C. Newsome.&#34; I
think he&#39;s trying to be funny. I think I
mean I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s trying to do
but but it comes across as childish and
what are you&#39;re the governor of the
biggest state in the union. What are you
Honestly, I feel like he&#39;s trying so
hard to be Trump, but he&#39;s coming off
like Kanye West. He seems absolutely
Here are my two favorite parts about
this. These people on Fox News and on
the right are are criticizing Gavin
Newsome for being childish
as he&#39;s literally just mocking Donald
Trump. He is just doing Trump. It&#39;s a
it&#39;s a onetoone bit. Like that&#39;s it.
There&#39;s no there&#39;s no there&#39;s no like uh
you know um uh there&#39;s no like uh
ambiguity in terms of what he&#39;s doing.
They&#39;re like, you know what, it&#39;s the
childishness that gets me. I really I
can&#39;t I can&#39;t handle the childishness.
this guy wants to be and the best part
is that they&#39;re saying he&#39;s the governor
of a state.
It&#39;s like the guy he&#39;s taking it from is
the president of all the states, all 50.
And that&#39;s perfectly fine, including
California. But when Newsome does Trump,
then it&#39;s somehow disqualifying.
I know. It&#39;s like that that&#39;s Trace
Gallagher is that guy&#39;s name. He&#39;s like
some tier three host on, you know,
Donald Trump&#39;s personal propaganda
network. To see him just act like
outraged by this all is just it&#39;s too
much. It&#39;s too great. But it shows like
how much this is getting under
Republicans skin and getting attention.
And just to quantify the impact, Brian,
uh CNN&#39;s Harry Eton did a segment about
the growth in interest in Gavin Newsome
because of these tactics. Let&#39;s watch.
Let&#39;s take a look right at the atgov
press office followers on X. That&#39;s of
course where you get those sort of the
account where Newsome post those Trump
style mocking types of tweets. Get this
that that account, get this,
450% in terms of the number of followers
since mid June. And it&#39;s not just on
Twitter. X where where Newsome is
gaining even on Tik Tok and Instagram.
His followers are up over a million
since January alone. My goodness
gracious. And more than that, Laura,
more than that. What about Google? What
about those Google searches for him? Get
this. Daily Google searches for Gavin
Newsome up like a rocket. What are we
talking about since June 1? Up 1300%.
Compared to August 1st, look at that. Up
500%. So, the bottom line is in
politics, especially if you&#39;re thinking
of entering in 2028, it&#39;s all about
generating attention. And so far, Gavin
Newsome has done a good job at
generating attention.
So, lots of growth on his Twitter
account. Lots of people googling Gavin
Newsome. And then I anecdotally, like
I&#39;ve heard from a ton of people who are
like, &#34;What&#39;s what&#39;s Gavin Newsome
doing? This is pretty funny. I think I
like this. I don&#39;t know.&#34;
It&#39;s it&#39;s smart. And and I&#39;ve heard the
same thing, especially from my normie
friends, the people who are not
political junkies. And that&#39;s what you
need to do in this political
environment. You know, we started off
2025 with looking at people who are
going to do something different to be
able to break through. We saw Cy Booker
do his 25-hour speech. We saw um Senator
Van Galand go to El Salvador to see if
he can retrieve Kimar Breo Garcia. It&#39;s
it&#39;s the people who are figuring out
ways to do something different uh that
are that are the ones that are getting
rewarded for it. And and I think
Newsomes is is doubly as beneficial
because yes, he&#39;s doing something
different using a very big platform to
kind of draw attention to there&#39;s
nothing there&#39;s nothing more effective
to make to make Trump feel small than
just overtly mocking him with probably
one of the biggest platforms that we
have on the left.
And and and it and it makes it so that
the next time Trump does his all caps
tweet, now everybody&#39;s looking at it in
a different light because it&#39;s just been
it&#39;s been so sumearily mocked and
belittled. They&#39;re watching when he
stops doing it. Have you noticed that?
Like a lot of reporters like, &#34;Oh, he
stopped tweeting in all caps.&#34;
Interesting.
Because it&#39;s so impossible not to feel
stupid once you&#39;ve been called out for
the thing. But it&#39;s also the fact that
he&#39;s just leaning forward and taking an
aggressive posture and and and it&#39;s this
sense of fight, not just online, but
also with this redistricting fight. And
and like, you know, for my part, I&#39;m
perfectly happy to highlight what he&#39;s
doing. Um because I want to give an
incentive structure to other people on
the left to recognize that like this is
what&#39;s doing well online because there
is an appetite for other Democratic
politicians to do this. We don&#39;t want
careful and circumspect and unoffensive
and quiet and polltested and focused
groups. We want people who are going to
lean forward and actually take it to
these Republicans who are right now so
blatantly undermining democracy.
Yes. So there there&#39;s some polling that
Harry outlined in a later part of that
segment where in 2017 they asked
Democratic voters do you want
politicians to stop Republicans or to
work with Republicans. So in 2017 stop
Republicans was 23% work with them was
74%. It was the Biden era
2025 uh stop Republicans it&#39;s 57% work
with Republicans is 42%. So there is a
sea change. Democrats are looking for a
fighter and that gets out all the tonal
things you just talked about. But
there&#39;s another part of this that is
just a smart strategy in terms of how
the media has changed and how Gavin
Newsome seems to understand that or at
least his team does. Yeah. Because Gavin
Newsome&#39;s team reaches out to places
like Crooked Media talks to folks like
you that they are talking to uh the
biggest progressive accounts on YouTube
and in this new media space and not
laundering all of their messaging
through mainstream media networks,
Politico, the New York Times, whatever.
They&#39;re talking to those uh groups too,
but they are doing what Donald Trump
did, which was working with
ideologically aligned new media and
helping those accounts build and grow.
And then also that helps him in the long
run or other Democrats to get their
message out. And like sometimes I&#39;ll
see, you know, former Biden officials
writing like op-eds or whatnot about how
Democrats need to better understand the
new media landscape. And it makes me so
mad because it&#39;s like you guys were in
office for four years. the power of the
with with the Kla campaign, you know, I
I had emailed the Kla campaign numerous
times to try to get an interview and um
I had also told told their team, you
know, it&#39;s not just that I want an
interview. Of course, I want an
interview. Everybody wants an interview.
Um, but it was a great opportunity when
all of the eyes of the country were on
her to validate any of these independent
creators in the space and they
ultimately just decided to go on like
Call Her Daddy and I think like maybe
one more big big podcast, but it was it
was a podcast it these were shows that
were already established and kind of
ignored all of the other shows, not just
political, not just big shows like mine,
but like had the opportunity to even go
on smaller shows and validate those
creators so that they would have a
bigger platform from which they can do
the hard work of persuasion for the rest
of the year. And and there was a
decision made that like, no, we wouldn&#39;t
nurture these these creators. We&#39;re just
going to go on shows that already have
an established audience. And that&#39;s a
missed opportunity. But Trump doesn&#39;t
doesn&#39;t miss those opportunities. That&#39;s
why we know what like Diamond and Silk
are. It&#39;s not because they&#39;re great at
what they do. It&#39;s because he took time
out of his schedule to say, &#34;I&#39;m going
to spend 15 minutes with these people.
I&#39;m going to put them on the map,
legitimize them in the eyes of their
audience, and by the way, it&#39;s going to
be a great ROI because those people will
then go out for the rest of the time,
the other 364 days a year, and and they
are evangelized for me. They&#39;ll spread
my gospel, my message.
Exactly. Yeah. There&#39;s this dumb
conversation that we&#39;re not going to
have here about the left needing a Joe
Rogan. But Donald Trump didn&#39;t just go
on Joe Rogan. He built relationships
with independent kind of
conservativeleaning
comedians and podcast hosts and talked
to them over and over and over again.
the Theo Vans, the Neelk Boys, as dumb
as they are, like all these kinds of
shows, and he helped them build a
megaphone and a platform, and he built a
relationship with their audience. And
that&#39;s the other thing Democrats are
struggling with with right now, which is
there&#39;s a report out today in the New
York Times about how the the number of
people registering to vote as Democrats
is just collapsing. Like, we have a
massive existential brand problem. And
the way you deal with something like
that is you don&#39;t just wait until the
next election. You get out there and you
talk about who you are. now every single

Little bitty baby YouTube channel. Um
anyway, uh Gavin Newsome talked with our
friend Alex Michaelson. He&#39;s a a great
California based journalist who I don&#39;t
even know what his next job is yet. He&#39;s
he&#39;s leaving his current one. He&#39;s going
to a new thing. That&#39;s why I&#39;m
describing him this weird circle
way. Alex just announced his uh his
departure from Fox LA. Uh he is the
biggest asset to Los Angeles based news.
Um very excited to see what his next
steps are.
Yeah. So Gavin sat that with Alex U and
he just talked about kind of this shift
in tone on his social on his uh social
media accounts and how he has changed as
a person in politician in Trump 2.0.
Let&#39;s watch a clip.
So yes, I&#39;ve changed. The facts have
changed. We need to change and we need
to stand up to this authoritarian. We
need to stand up at this moment. It is
foundational. Again, it is not about
Republican versus Democrat. This guy is
an invasive species. He&#39;s completely
different. I respect the Republican
party. I&#39;m married in a Republican
family. I have deep love and respect for
people I disagree with. He is something
altogether different. And he is unorded.
There is no constraints. So yes, we&#39;re
going to punch back. And yes, we&#39;re
going to punch back with a full weight
of the fourth largest economy in the
world, the size of 21 state population
combined. and with the consent of the
people that endow the power to
government, we will do the right thing
and we will push back and we will
succeed this November.
I love that invasive species line. I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard him use that
I know. It&#39;s great because he look he
understands that it&#39;s twofold. It&#39;s not
just about breaking through to succeed
in the attention economy. Like that unto
itself is not the goal for somebody
doing it. It&#39;s to draw attention. It&#39;s
to figure out whatever way you can to
get in front of people so that you can
draw attention to these to these
existential threats to democracy
like redistricting.
Like like redistricting. I mean, the
reality is that the Republicans are
scientifically engineering these maps to
preclude Democrats from ever being able
to gain power again, to ever be able to
win the House again. That&#39;s existential,
not just for the Democratic party, but
for politics in this country more
broadly, for democracy more broadly. And
so good on him for figuring out any way
to break through so that he can get
eyeballs on him, even if it&#39;s, you know,
the the the the ridiculous stuff or the
jokes and whatnot. Ultimately, it raises
the floor for for eyeballs that are on
him on his accounts so that when he
wants to really expose these serious
threats to democracy, he&#39;s got that
audience now that he wouldn&#39;t have had
otherwise.
Yeah. No, it it I was laughing because
like we live in this world where you&#39;re
starting to see all these all these
memes of like g a shirtless Gavin from a
romance novel holding like Melania or
like or Ivanka calling him daddy.
And weirdly that is how you draw
attention to your plan to combat Texas&#39;s
redistricting which is happening you
know in the middle of the decade which
completely unprecedented. And also Gavin
Steam released some polling today that
found that nearly 60% of California
voters backed this like limited
redistricting change that allows us to
fight against Trump for the duration of
his presidency.
I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s so smart because any
way you can get eyeballs on you, even if
it&#39;s and we&#39;re going to put right here
on the screen this picture of Newsome,
Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, and and a and
a late Hulk Hogan all touching Gavin
Newsome in this in this like de as if
he&#39;s their deity. like whatever it takes
to get eyeballs on you so that when it
comes time to perpetuate the real
message, which is like look at what&#39;s
going on, more more power to him.
I just I would love to like have been in
the room when Kid Rock saw that for the
first time when his 15th buddy said it
to him.
You know that like uh he just went back
into the backyard, set up some Bud Light
cans, and started just shooting shooting
the out of him. He&#39;s like, &#34;Ah,
no better way to no better way to blow
off some steam than by blowing the heads
off of these Bud Light cans.&#34; Nothing
nothing says real man like shooting a
can of beer.
What a what a fun episode. Shooting beer
cans. Screaming couch JD Vans.
