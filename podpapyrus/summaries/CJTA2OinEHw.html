I&#39;m Alex Wellerstein. I&#39;m a nuclear
historian. I&#39;m here today to answer your
questions from the internet. This is
nuclear history support.
All right. First up, we have one from
American versus Gov. What countries have
nukes? There are nine countries today in
the world with nuclear weapons that we
know about. The United States, first
country that got them. The Soviet Union
got them in 1949. Today, those nuclear
weapons are in the hands of the Russian
Federation. the United Kingdom, People&#39;s
Republic of China, France. These are the
five officially allowed countries under
the nuclear non-prololiferation treaty
to have nuclear weapons. There is also
Israel, India, Pakistan, and North
Korea. So, nine countries total. There
were a few countries that inherited
nuclear weapons after the fall of the
Soviet Union, Ukraine, Barus, and
Kazakhstan, but they returned all of
those weapons to Russia uh in an
agreement. LJW Whitman one asks, &#34;Who
decides which countries can have nukes
and which countries can&#39;t? What are
their criteria?&#34; The decision about who
can quote unquote have nukes and who
quote unquote can&#39;t. This is uh the
result of a treaty, the nuclear
non-prololiferation treaty, which was
created in 1968 to try and slow the
spread of nuclear weapons. If you sign
the treaty, you agree that only five
countries, the countries that had tested
nuclear weapons uh by 1967 are allowed
to have nuclear weapons. Anybody else is
not allowed under that treaty. So if you
sign that treaty, you agree those are
the only five that have nuclear weapons
and nobody else should have. Pakistan,
India, and Israel never signed the
treaty, have developed their own nuclear
weapons. There&#39;s also North Korea which
was a member of the treaty but then left
the treaty and made nuclear weapons. Is
it illegal for them to have nuclear
weapons only in the sense that they&#39;re
not members of the treaty? What the
nuclear non-prololiferation treaty does
is it allows any country without nuclear
weapons to know that anybody else who
signed the treaty is probably not also
trying to get nuclear weapons. So, if
you&#39;re worried that your rival across
the way might be getting nukes, if you
and they both sign the treaty, then
you&#39;re not going to have to worry as
much about them getting the weapons. It
also gives them access to peaceful
nuclear technology like nuclear
reactors. It means that they have the
right to work on that kind of stuff
without worrying that somebody&#39;s going
to try and, you know, blow up their
reactor out of fear that it&#39;s a nuclear
bomb. Zip Thang asks, &#34;Was Iran building
a bomb? If so, how close to a bomb was
Iran? How were the nuclear talks going
before Israel preemptively attacked?&#34;
Great question. Was Iran building a
nuclear weapon? No. I don&#39;t think
anybody thinks Iran was actively
building a nuclear weapon. The
accusation made particularly by Israel
is that Iran was setting up the
conditions under which it could build a
nuclear weapon very quickly if it wanted
to. Iran did have a nuclear weapons
program before 2003 and the Iran deal
was them essentially saying we&#39;re going
to close down and disable all the little
things we were doing that were bad and
we won&#39;t do them anymore. Once the
United States left the Iran deal, Iran
has been creeping up beyond the limits
of the deal. You know, depending on what
your stance is, you either think that&#39;s
because they are trying to get ready to
make a bomb or because they&#39;re trying to
compel the United States to come back to
the negotiation table as a way of
saying, &#34;Look, if you leave this deal,
which we did, we can do this now. And if
you want us to stop, come back to the
deal.&#34; Now, how are the nuclear talks
going? I don&#39;t think that great. I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s clear exactly what Iran
wants, per se. They&#39;re sort of leaving
the door open for different options,
which would make a lot of sense given
the recent history that they&#39;ve had with
the United States and with Israel, but
they were not, you know, racing to make
a bomb. Hell here, akitten asks, WTF is
a nuclear football. It&#39;s basically a
suitcase. What the nuclear football is
meant to do is allow the president of
the United States to order a nuclear uh
strike even if they are not in the White
House or the Pentagon. If the president
is visiting some other country or some
other city, they have basically a very
burly usually military person carrying a
very heavy suitcase around and in that
suitcase there are information about
nuclear war plans. There are some
communication tools probably to allow
the president to easily link up with top
generals and advisers and uh whatever is
needed to authenticate the president&#39;s
nuclear war order if the president
decides to make that. Sophie Celson
asks, &#34;Once in a while I think about how
many nukes the US has lost. How tf do
you lose a nuke? Find them now.&#34; There
are a number of quote unquote lost
nuclear weapons. And what that really
means is there is a nuclear weapon that
was on say an airplane or a submarine
and that airplane either crashed or the
submarine sunk and the weapon is now in
the environment in the world. These
kinds of accidents were not super
uncommon during the Cold War. The United
States had a program in the 1950s and
1960s to basically have airplanes with
nuclear weapons flying in the air 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, so that if
nuclear war started, they could have
some kind of guarantee that they&#39;d have
a plane ready to retaliate no matter
what. Same thing with submarines. They
are still go around with nuclear weapons
on them all the time. If you have
thousands of airplanes flying tens of
thousands of flight hours, you&#39;re going
to have an accident every once in a
while. Some of these accidents have
resulted in like the weapon either
itself falling out of the plane or in
the case of a submarine just going down
to the bottom of the ocean. Any kind of
mishap you can imagine, a lot of them
have happened. In most cases, of course,
the United States is very interested in
recovering those weapons, both because
it&#39;s, you know, not a good look to have
lost nuclear weapons, but also they
contain the fuel you might need to make
more nuclear weapons, and you don&#39;t want
that falling in the wrong hands. And so,
the US always tried to recover these
things, but sometimes the warhead sunk
so deep underground that after weeks of
trying to dig it out, they couldn&#39;t get
it or it&#39;s at the bottom of the ocean
and they couldn&#39;t find it. They&#39;re lost
in the sense that the US can&#39;t recover
them, not that they don&#39;t know more or
less where they are. And they&#39;re lost in
the sense that the US couldn&#39;t recover
them and thinks nobody else could
either. And decided to sort of cut their
losses. And you know, maybe they put a
monument that says don&#39;t dig here. But
they concluded that if the army couldn&#39;t
dig this thing up, nobody else could
either. Matilda Mother67 asks, &#34;Why did
the United States bomb Hiroshima and
Nagasaki instead of some military
headquarters or other places where
civilians weren&#39;t?&#34; There were a lot of
processes uh and meetings and decisions
made along the way about what this bomb
was, how it should work, what it would
be used against. At the beginning of
making the bomb, like say 1943,
the attitude was we&#39;ll probably use this
against some sort of military
installation. The first target they even
discussed was basically the Japanese
equivalent of Pearl Harbor. Um it&#39;s
called truck. And sure, there would be
some civilians there, but it&#39;s not
dropping it in the middle of a city. By
2 years later, one, truck is not an
issue militarily anymore. They had cut
it off. It was not a target. And two,
the United States had gotten in the
habit of targeting cities. In the early
part of 1945, the United States began
firebombing Japanese cities with Nepal.
They burnt Tokyo. They burnt Osaka. They
ended up burning 67 Japanese cities by
dropping basically flaming gasoline on
them. The other issue is that the bomb
they ended up with was one that would
work best if you detonated it pretty
high in the air. If you detonated it
high in the air, you spread the d blast
damage out wider, but your blast damage
is also less intense. So, if your target
is some builtup bunker, you&#39;re not going
to destroy it by blowing up the bomb in
the air. If your target is a house, you
don&#39;t need as much blast pressure to
destroy it. So, they had a bomb that
they ended up with through technical
decisions along the way that would be
most impressive if you used it on a
city. And they had many discussions
about what kind of target, what&#39;s the
goal of this weapon. The goal of the
weapon was essentially psychological.
They wanted to cause the Japanese people
to say, &#34;We cannot tolerate this. We
cannot win. Let&#39;s surrender.&#34; One of the
people involved in the discussion said
that the goal was to have the Japanese
basically capitulate to the power of the
universe. Oh, you don&#39;t want to
surrender to the United States or the
Soviet Union? Well, what if we use the
power of the sun to destroy you? To me,
the really interesting thing is that
Hiroshima was not their first choice at
all for a target. The first choice that
the military had was Kyoto, former
capital of Japan. It was taken off the
list by the Secretary of War, Henry
Stimson, because he thought that the
city was too civilian in nature, was a
cultural heritage site. Hiroshima got
then bumped up to first place because it
had some military uh bases and
manufacturing in it. It had not yet been
bombed. Its geography was such that it
was sort of like a bowlshaped city
surrounded by hills and that meant it
would kind of intensify the effect of
the weapon. So from the point of view of
the United States military and the
scientists who consulted from them, it
was a perfectly good target. Nagasaki
was only added to the target list after
Kyoto was taken off of it because they
wanted a backup target. The actual
target for the second bombing run was a
different city, Kokura. Kokura had a
major um arsenal in the center of it
that produced weapons for the Japanese
and was surrounded by workers&#39; houses.
So by their criteria, this was a great
target. When they got to Kokura though,
they found that it was covered by smoke
or clouds or haze. It&#39;s not clear
exactly what, but they could not see it
to exactly target the bomb on it, so
they went to the backup target, which
was Nagasaki, which was nearby. Matthew
S. Wait asks, &#34;I can&#39;t help but think
gun control debates mirror that of
nuclear weapons proliferation. Does
every country having nukes make us all
safer?&#34; This is a classic question. Is
the world safer if there are only a
couple countries with nuclear weapons,
or would it be safer if all the
countries had nuclear weapons? If there
were a lot of countries with nuclear
weapons, presumably they would be very
hesitant to go to war with one another
because the consequences would be
terrible. On the other hand, if you
think that the chances of either
accidental nuclear war or people
thinking nuclear war was winnable or
terrorism, if you think the chances of
those are relatively high, then more
nuclear weapons in the world is a much
more dangerous world because that&#39;s a
world in which nuclear war is more
likely to occur. It&#39;s not clear what the
answer is here. Generally speaking, I&#39;m
more swayed by the arguments that it is
a little bit dangerous to have lots of
countries with nuclear weapons in the
world. I know that&#39;s a really hot take,
but I don&#39;t trust the systems or
governments of these countries to be
sort of perfect with regard to they&#39;re
not starting a nuclear war. And if you
don&#39;t think that they&#39;re going to be
perfect, then it becomes very dangerous
over time. the more people who have
nuclear weapons. Huge bag 69 asks,
&#34;Enriched uranium. What is it? What is
the process of enriching? How dangerous
is it on its own?&#34; So, uranium is an
element. You can mine it out of the
ground. It&#39;s a rock. Can even get it out
of seawater. It&#39;s relatively abundant.
By itself, if we went out and got a rock
of uranium, the uranium we would h find
would have two types of uranium inside
of it. One of them would be called
uranium 238. there would be 99% of that
in any uranium we pulled out of the
ground. And less than 1% of it, it&#39;s
would be uranium 235. So these are two
of the same element, but they differ in
that uranium 238 has three more neutrons
inside of it than uranium 235. So we
call these different isotopes. Uranium
238 will not explode in a bomb. Uranium
235 will. So enrichment is when we take
this uranium and pull out the uranium
235 almost literally atom by atom. This
is a very difficult process to do
because the difference between these is
only three neutrons which is not very
much. They are chemically identical. So
we have to rely on the fact that one&#39;s a
little bit lighter than the other. So
uranium enrichment there&#39;s different
processes for doing it. The most famous
right now is the centrifuge where we
basically are spinning around uranium in
a gaseous form. And as we spin it, the
centrifugal forces will cause the
lighter uranium to move slightly in more
one direction and the heavier slightly
another. And we skim off the part that
would have the lighter. And we have to
run it through another centuge to skim
off a little more and then another to
skim off a little more. And so we&#39;re
taking advantage of little tiny
statistical differences and how heavy
they are. And we do this for thousands
of centrifuges and you will eventually
end up with more and more uranium 235.
When we want uranium for fuel in a
nuclear power plant, we tend to enrich
it up to about 3% uranium 235. When we
want it for a bomb, we want it to be
much higher than that. The bomb dropped
on Hiroshima was about 80% uranium 235.
In the United States now, the standard
amount in a weapon if we use enriched
uranium is around 93% enriched uranium.
The fourth resident asks, &#34;Wait, but
Einstein was not a part of the Manhattan
project. So, how or why did they get his
help during it?&#34; Einstein&#39;s role in the
atomic bomb was uh at the very beginning
he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt
saying, &#34;Hey, we have learned how to
split atoms. Germany might be working on
this. maybe somebody in the United
States government should be looking at
this. And that&#39;s more or less his role
in the whole Manhattan project. Why
didn&#39;t they use him? They actually did
consider using him. And they concluded
two things. One, Einstein at this point
is pretty old. He&#39;s not your cutting
edge scientist. The kind of science he
does is not actually that useful for
making an atomic bomb. Yes. Yes. E= MC²
sort of explains in a way where the
energy comes from an atomic bomb. It
does not tell you how to make one. It
doesn&#39;t tell you how to make a factory.
and design the things and the parts. You
don&#39;t need somebody like Einstein to do
that. The other thing is that Einstein
was considered politically radical. He
supported really out there ideas like
civil rights. And that at that time
meant that he was considered to be
politically questionable by some people
in the US government. And so if he is
the kind of person who to be fair might
have strong ideas about how atomic bombs
ought to be used and has a lot of fame
and is the kind of person that
presidents would listen to, maybe you
don&#39;t want him to be in the project if
your goal is to just sort of get the
thing done. Coastal Buckeye asks, &#34;Is
there still a radiation field in
Hiroshima or Nagasaki?&#34; Great question.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki had atomic bombs
dropped on them in World War II. Here&#39;s
Hiroshima. This is not far from ground
zero. You can see this building, the
very famous atomic bomb dome. Ground
zero is very close to that. These
weapons were detonated very high above
the city. If you look at pictures of
these bombs, this is a mockup of a the
kind of bomb dropped in Hiroshima. This
is one for Nagasaki. You can see they&#39;ve
got this equipment on them. Weird little
wires. These are fuses that detect how
high above the ground the bomb is. and
they were set to detonate at the height
that the scientists had calculated would
maximize the blast effect of the weapon.
You can think of the blast as going sort
of as a sphere out from the explosion.
And if it&#39;s really close to the ground,
a lot of that is going to be going sort
of sideways and it&#39;s going to be running
into buildings and they&#39;re going to be
absorbing the energy and also reducing
it as a consequence. If you detonate it
in the air, you&#39;re sort of going down
with the blast force and it&#39;s going to
be much wider area. So, it was detonated
high in the air. The consequence of that
is the people at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
they got a blast of immediate radiation.
It&#39;s like almost like a light switch
turning on and off. You wouldn&#39;t be able
to see it, but imagine it&#39;s just like a
quick exposure, almost like X-rays or
something like that. And that was very
bad for the people who were in the range
at which that would occur. But it&#39;s a
short immediate effect. It&#39;s sort of
almost like a one-time exposure. The
thing that makes nuclear weapons so
contaminating is the nuclear fallout.
These are the split atoms from the
weapon. And these are in the mushroom
cloud. And one interesting thing you can
actually see in some of these pictures.
So this is a picture of Nagasaki&#39;s
mushroom cloud taken from someone on the
one of the airplanes that was involved
in the bombing of Nagasaki. And if you
look closely, you can see the cloud is
actually two different parts. You have
this top part, the head, and then you
have this dark stem underneath it. And
you can actually see that they don&#39;t
connect. This is an artifact of the
weapon being detonated higher up. This
cloud contains the most radioactive
residues from the bomb. This is mostly
created by fire and debris and dust that
is being pulled up by the negative
pressure of this cloud moving upwards.
And it is not that radioactive. Now, if
this bomb had been detonated on the
ground, these two parts would be mixed
together. And if that happens, then the
radioactive bits attach themselves to
the dirt and then fall out of the cloud
relatively quickly because the dirt is
pretty heavy, relatively speaking. If it
doesn&#39;t happen, this part stays
relatively light and it&#39;ll blow on with
the wind. And as it blows, it&#39;ll take a
while for it to start to fall out of the
cloud. And what that gets you is two
things. One, the most radioactive stuff
with short half- livives, they get to
sort of burn out before they fall down.
But this cloud, because it has time to
spread, it means that it&#39;s diluting. So
more area gets some radioactive bits,
but they get less like per square meter,
per square foot. So the amount of
radiation is is diffused in a way that
doesn&#39;t actually make it a contamination
hazard. So the long and short of it is
because they&#39;re detonated at high
altitude, they did not really get a lot
of nuclear fallout. Today, they are not
radioactive in any significant way. If
the bombs had been detonated on the
ground, it would be a different story.
on Reddit asks, &#34;What actually happens
to someone in an atomic bomb explosion?&#34;
The first thing if you saw a nuclear
weapon go off, one, the brightness of
it. It&#39;s very bright. With that
brightness comes this flash of
radiation. So, if you are close enough
to an atomic bomb, you will instantly
get a lot of radioactive particles,
gamma rays, beta particles, things like
this going through your body. For the uh
Hiroshima bomb, the radius from the
detonation point where you would get a
fatal amount of radiation is about 3/4
of a mile. If you&#39;re in that zone,
you&#39;re probably dead no matter what
happens next. If you&#39;re a little out of
that zone, you might get some radiation.
That is probably not your biggest
concern for most nuclear weapons, but
it&#39;s not the best, right? The next thing
that you would experience is heat. The
surface of the fireball is hotter than
the sun. Uh, briefly, if you&#39;re in
direct line of sight with this, it&#39;s
sort of like if the sun was suddenly a
lot closer to you than it is right now.
If you&#39;re really close to the fireball,
you could be literally vaporized, as
people say. Most of the people at
Hiroshima Nagasaki are not vaporized or
melted or anything, but they are
severely burned. You can get really bad
burns. the next effect that fireball uh
in that first split second of it going
off is sort of superheating the air
around it. And what&#39;s going to happen
then is it&#39;s going to be moving outward.
This is the shock wave, the blast wave.
And as it goes out, it&#39;s this sort of
wave of pressure that&#39;s going to
intersect with the ground and move along
it and push. And the more it goes, the
weaker it goes. But this is powerful
enough at different distances to do a
lot of damage. So at uh uh Hiroshima, if
you were about 300 m from ground zero,
that would be enough blast pressure,
about 20 lb per square inch, to destroy
almost any building that is standing.
Any buildings that are still remaining
at Hiroshima, like the famous atomic
bomb dome, are gutted. Like nobody&#39;s
doing well who was inside this building.
They&#39;re all dead. If you go out a little
further, if you were about uh 1.7
kilometers from ground zero at
Hiroshima, that&#39;s the radius at which
there&#39;s enough to definitely destroy
light structures. So, houses, things
like that. You go out further to maybe
about 2.8 miles. And now the blast wave
is weak enough that the most it&#39;s doing
is sort of breaking windows. That&#39;s
still not great. If you&#39;re standing out
a window as this thing comes to you,
it&#39;s going to break all the glass and
push it into you. and now you&#39;ve been
injured by a window. So depending on
where you are, there&#39;s different effects
that can happen. Strandfort asks on
Reddit, &#34;For how long do I stay in a
Fallout shelter after a nuclear war?&#34;
The amount of time you need to stay in
there depends on how radioactive the
Fallout is. Now, a lot of people think
of Fallout shelters like the game or
show Fallout, and they think we&#39;re going
to stay in there for 100 years or
something like that. That is not what
they are built to do. They are built to
basically accommodate people to maybe
stay in there for at most two weeks,
maybe even less. You might recognize
these signs. These are from the 1960s
program to identify places that could be
used as fallout shelters. A fallout
shelter is not meant to protect you from
a nuclear weapon that drops on you. What
it&#39;s meant to do is be a place that puts
mass, so concrete or dirt ideally, in
between you and the outside world, so
that if radioactive particles fall on
top of you, there is something in
between you and them to cut the amount
of radiation. So, you can think of it
when you go to the dentist and they take
an X-ray and they put one of these heavy
lead uh aprons on you. It&#39;s sort of like
a building equivalent of that lead
apron. Mac65 asks, &#34;How dangerous is
Chernobyl today?&#34; There are people who
visit Chernobyl or did before the
Ukraine Russia war. There are people who
work at Chernobyl still today and they
have means of checking how much
radiation they pick up. There are tools
called domters. This is one from the
Cold War. It basically tracks how much
radiation you get. This one works by
looking through it at a light and a
little wire moves as it absorbs
radiation. And the workers on these
kinds of places are making sure that the
amount of radiation they pick up is
within what we consider to be the safe
amounts. You probably wouldn&#39;t want to
live in Chernobyl, though. There are
some people who have been living there.
People who used to live there that
eventually went back and they&#39;ve said,
&#34;You know what? I just want to live in
my own home. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s
contaminated.&#34; Are they at risk? Well, a
little. But if they&#39;re 70 years old and
living at Chernobyl increases their
cancer risk by say 5%, they&#39;re probably
going to die of something else anyway
because it takes a long time for those
kinds of cancers to develop. If we talk
about what if 10,000 people live there
and the cancer risk goes up by 5%,
you&#39;re going to start seeing that as 5%
more cancers in this community than you
would already have. Austin&#39;s Burner
asks, &#34;How DF does radiation work? How
does a place be radioactive? How does
someone die from radiation poisoning?
You can think of it as little particles.
That&#39;s basically what the word radiation
means. It means little things spitting
out. And there&#39;s lots of different kinds
of radiation. The kind that people are
usually talking about is called ionizing
radiation. And that means radiation of
types and energies that are capable of
knocking electrons off of other atoms
and molecules. The problem is that if
you&#39;re made out of cells, especially if
you have DNA, ionizing things, that
changes their chemistry. And if you were
a rock, who would care? But if you&#39;re a
biological system, that means you&#39;re
like shooting little bullets into cells,
which can kill them, which is fine. You
have a lot of cells, or it can in some
rare cases change the DNA in a way that
turns it into a cancerous cell.
Radiation poisoning is when you get so
much radiation that the number of cells
you&#39;re killing becomes actually
significant. So radioactive
contamination is when a place has
radioactive stuff that is sending out
the radiation. So I have a geer counter
here. A geer counter is a tool for
detecting radioactivity. So what it has
in it is a sensor that can tell when a
radioactive particle has gone across it.
And whenever it does this, you&#39;re
hearing this little click happening. Why
does it click? Because we hooked it to a
speaker and we want to be able to hear
it. Now, I could have a radioactive
substance. This is trinitite, the glass
from the first nuclear test. This is
something that contains trace amounts of
plutonium and uranium and long lived
fishing products. And if I put the
sensor over it,
you can hear that the clicking increases
by a bit. The air right above this
radioactive material is getting about
twice as much radioactivity as the
normal air around here. That&#39;s not that
much. If this was something actually
dangerous, it would be getting a lot
more, hundred times more. But this is
the sort of tool that lets you measure
when these radioactive particles are
being emitted from this uh radioactive
substance. Glittering weakness 88 on
Reddit asks, &#34;What is the theoretical
upper power limit of a nuke we can
produce currently?&#34; If you wanted to,
you can make essentially an unlimited
power nuclear weapon. A thermonuclear
weapon basically works by having one
nuclear weapon act as sort of the
detonator for another nuclear weapon.
And if you wanted to, you could make
that weapon be the detonator for another
nuclear weapon and that detonator for
another nuclear weapon. The largest
nuclear weapon ever made was the Soviet
Zar Bomba. It was tested in 1961 as a 50
megaton sized weapon. So 50 million tons
of TNT and that was at half its power.
It was deliberately scaled back by half
to prevent uh contamination. By
comparison, the Hiroshima bomb is 15,000
tons of TNT. So this is a weapon
thousands of times more powerful than
the first atomic bombs. The United
States could have done that. They
actually looked into doing that kind of
thing in the Cold War and decided not
to. So, the largest weapon that I know
of that was ever taken seriously by
weapon scientists in the United States
was called the Sund Dial. It was never
built. They didn&#39;t get that far in
researching it, but it was a weapon that
was 10,000 megat tons of TNT. Why did
the United States not do this? Why did
even the Soviet Union not really do
this? The Zar Bomba was sort of a stunt
more than a practical weapon. The answer
is one, you don&#39;t get that much from it
because of the way uh nuclear weapons
work because they&#39;re basically a sphere
expanding in the air. Think of it as a
balloon that you&#39;re like pumping air
into. What we care about for the damage
is the amount of the balloon that&#39;s
going to touch the ground. A lot of that
balloon is not going to touch the
ground. And as we&#39;re putting energy into
it, the part that&#39;s touching the ground,
it&#39;s not increasing as a linear
function. It&#39;s increasing as what&#39;s
called a cubic root. The takeaway is if
we wanted to double the damage of a
weapon, we typically have to increase
the size of the weapon by around eight
times. The real killer though is to make
them bigger, we do more or less have to
linearly increase the weight and size of
the weapon. So the Zar Bomba is a
powerful weapon, but it&#39;s the size of a
school bus. That weapon could not fit
inside the airplane that carried it and
had to sort of sit underneath it like a
big egg. If you&#39;re another country and
you see a plane coming towards you with
a big egg attached to it, you&#39;re going
to really work hard to shoot that down.
That is not convenient. If you&#39;re
talking about weapons that are the size
of the sund dial, 10,000 megat tons,
that&#39;s a weapon that&#39;s probably the size
of the space shuttle. That&#39;s not easy to
use. That&#39;s not easy to deploy. That&#39;s
going to be also really expensive. And
as an aside, trends in nuclear weapons
design didn&#39;t go in that area. What they
did was they went for more compact
weapons. So you can put 10 of them onto
one missile and then target 10 targets
with one missile. It&#39;s a weapon the size
of a large trash can, but it&#39;s 30 times
more explosive than Hiroshima. That&#39;s
peak weapons design, not just more bang.
Perfect football 2616 on Reddit asks,
&#34;Did the tactic of duck and cover
provide any protection from an actual
nuclear strike?&#34; Duck and Cover was a
public education program put out by the
United States government and it was uh
particularly aimed at school children
and you&#39;ll see pictures of children
hiding under their desk from this
period. There was a short film created
with a turtle cartoon mascot B the
turtle trying to talk to students about
nuclear war. And of course a lot of it
looks pretty sketchy. There are lots of
people who live through this who said
that was the moment I realized adults
did not know what they were doing if
they thought this desk was going to
protect me from an atomic bomb. They are
not saying that if an atomic bomb lands
on your school, your desk is going to
keep you safe. What they are doing with
this policy is saying there&#39;s going to
be an area where the bomb goes off where
you just have no hope. I&#39;m sorry. They
don&#39;t say this in the movie because it&#39;s
aimed at children. They don&#39;t even say
this at things aimed at adults because
the United States government has a very
hard time admitting that people are
going to die in large numbers if nuclear
weapons go off. Even though it is
self-evidently true, there&#39;s also a zone
much further out where you&#39;re far enough
away that you&#39;ll say, &#34;What was that? Oh
my gosh, what&#39;s going on?&#34; You are not
going to be affected by the weapon,
right? You&#39;re going to learn from the
news. So, in between is a pretty small
zone where you have a chance of
surviving if you do the right thing.
Duck and cover is for that zone and it&#39;s
for an area where the blast pressure is
going to be enough that it&#39;s going to be
sort of like an earthquake. They&#39;re
worried about the ceiling collapsing.
They&#39;re worried about windows breaking.
They&#39;re worried that if you have exposed
skin, you might get burned. And so the
tactic is get down, cover up your most
vulnerable parts, and you can increase
your chance of survival a little bit
that way. The mute N on Reddit, great
name. How close did Nazi Germany
actually get to developing an atomic
weapon? Nazi Germany did not get close
to making an atomic bomb. At the end of
World War II, they were almost to the
place that the United States was in
So, they almost had a prototype nuclear
reactor, not an atomic bomb. Why not?
Because they weren&#39;t trying to make an
atomic bomb. I know that&#39;s a hot take
because we like to talk about the race
for the atomic bomb. The Americans
feared they were working on atomic bomb,
but the Germans had actually decided
they were going to have a pretty small
research program for nuclear reactors,
maybe in the future making atomic bombs.
But they concluded in 1942 that it would
take a lot of work from a lot of their
scientists to try and make an atomic
bomb that could be useful for World War
II. And in 1942, they thought they were
going to win the war. So they didn&#39;t
think they needed an atomic bomb. They
thought that making an atomic bomb would
be very hard and they were correct on
that and as a result they thought nobody
else was going to make one either. So
this is a problem for after the war.
Well that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all the
questions. I hope you learned something.
I hope you don&#39;t make an atomic bomb. Uh
until next time.
