<li>Penn State conducts walk-on tryouts twice a year - once in fall and once in spring</li>
<li>A disguised person named "Chad Powers" attempted to try out as a walk-on quarterback</li>
<li>Hollywood makeup artists were hired to create a convincing college student disguise</li>
<li>Chad Powers claimed to be "the next great Penn State quarterback"</li>
<li>There was debate about throwing strategy - short completions vs. deep passes to showcase arm strength</li>
<li>Chad preferred throwing deep passes despite advice to focus on chain-moving completions</li>
<li>Multiple receivers participated in the tryout to catch passes from quarterbacks</li>
<li>Chad demonstrated strong arm talent that attracted attention from other players</li>
<li>Word spread quickly about Chad's throwing ability, drawing crowds to watch</li>
<li>Chad consistently threw accurate passes that left marks on receivers' chests</li>
<li>Coaches and players were impressed by Chad's footwork and anticipation</li>
<li>Someone expressed interest in "signing the Chad Powers guy"</li>
<li>The coaching staff appreciates the walk-on program as an opportunity for players to chase dreams</li>
<li>Chad was ultimately disqualified for two reasons: poor testing numbers and ineligibility</li>
<li>Chad ran a 5.49 forty-yard dash and had a 7'10" broad jump - both inadequate</li>
<li>Chad had no remaining college eligibility, making him ineligible to play</li>
<li>Chad revealed he was actually 41 years old, just wanting to play football again</li>
<li>Despite the deception, the experience was positive and fun for all participants</li>
