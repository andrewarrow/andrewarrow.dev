decent blessing I am sir such a bright
air box Lee and we&#39;re here in my
hometown of Natchez Mississippi at the
nicest visitors and Convention Center
where I have an exhibition about chattel
slavery selling markets the markets that
operated in Natchez from 1833 to the
1860 civil war called the folks of the
road this is a place that was east of
Natchez where dealers and flavored
traffickers who were selling our
ancestors from the upper South Maryland
Virginia DC Kentucky Missouri and
bringing them down to Natchez
Mississippi during the days of child
flavory roughly from 1833 to 1863 are
when the Union Army occupied Natchez and
they operated that the folks of the road
a jump ship place and not just east of
Natchez call the folks to the road I&#39;ve
been working on the history of chattel
slavery since 1995 my return back to
Natchez and what I&#39;m essentially doing
is I&#39;m carrying on an equal history
campaign equal history means to me in
definition overcoming white people
trying to make it look like they&#39;ve done
everything by themselves so Natchez is a
historic city at one point it was the
most Richard it was the richest city in
the deep south in terms of the cotton
Kingdom there were more millionaires and
Natchez at one point around the 1850s
than any other place per capital they
say in the country this was based upon
selling and buying of enslaved people
who were enslaved on the plantations in
the surrounding areas and what they call
the old Natchez district of the counties
of Jefferson Claiborne Adams Wilkinson
Franklin and the parishes of Concordia
and since our parishes
in Louisiana were essentially the
concentration of a slave person who was
so here the the folks of the road market
was said to be the second largest in
flame is selling market in the old
Southwest outside of New Orleans New
Orleans was considered to be the largest
one in the deep south west not in the
complete south because in the complete
South Charleston South Carolina was the
largest so what I&#39;ve been able to do for
the last 23 years is to look at this
history channel enslavement and fine and
research the stories and the adds a
whole complexity of research done to
help come up with the facts and the data
that reflects the history of what
happened in Natchez at the folks of the
road enslavement market and as a result
of that research I put together a
traveling Exposition exhibit as such
it&#39;s called folks of the road and we
want to look at this folks of the world
travelers David I want you to come with
me and I&#39;m going to try to give you an
example of quick explanation what the is
if it contains and so the first panel in
the exhibit is called Fox River Road in
flaming market the a major Southwest hub
of America&#39;s domestic slave trade and
when I say the word say it&#39;s going to be
in quotation because I would never call
my ancestors that oppressive term slave
we wouldn&#39;t call our great-great
grandparents the other names or any
oppressive names aside and there&#39;s no
real social redeeming need and 2018 to
be referring to our African ancestor
this flame that&#39;s somebody else
oppressor term and we want to use the
term enslaved
which tells us that at one point in time
we had another status other than being
forced brought out
Africa in captivity and enslaved in the
so the first panel gives you an idea
whether location of the marketplaces
would be you can see this is a juncture
of streets east of Natchez that we&#39;ll
call st. Catherine Street Liberty Road
and Washington Road and there were these
enslavement markets where you see the
brown squares located at the Fox of the
road and dozens upon dozens of dealers
or traders or traffickers or
what-have-you operated from this site so
I want you to be able to see what the
location see see what the title is the
visible is and then it&#39;s in the Africa
ethical order we can move to the second
panel the second panel parinama tool is
called Natchez an early gateway for
European migrating southwest and center
of chattel enslavement and tragedy that
is Natchez the city of Natchez in
Mississippi was at the center of trading
and essentially this panel shows you the
early history of the different invaders
into the Mississippi Natchez area we had
in the early history the French 1700
early 1700 the same people who invaded
New Orleans and then later on we had the
British and the Spanish who took turns
invading and occupying the area of
Mississippi and Natchez and finally the
group of people who will call the
Americans who also occupied Natchez and
what-have-you and it tells us gives you
the picture of the example of the Prince
among slaves that were an enslaved
person called Abdul Rahman Ibrahim but
with the Fulani brought from West Africa
up around Timbuktu and this just gives
thousands of enslaved African people who
fortunately brought in captivity doing
when America created the embargo of the
law against further bringing Africans
ancestors into the Americas after 1808
and and so you going to get some early
history about Natchez the development of
the Mississippi the Southwest and the
early and straight people who were
brought here in the 1700s early 1730&#39;s
on up until the the the the turn of the
century when the cotton gin was invented
and when the cotton gin was invented
that became a huge demand or what they
call a demand that could not be
satisfied in terms of the need for
enslaved people to work the cotton and
to work the sugar cane and the Lower
Mississippi Valley
pehle number three deals with in the
Tyler says America&#39;s domestic slave
trading routes to the deep south
essentially this panel is a map that has
been overlaid several times with other
maps that showed what the walking routes
were from the upper low Southwest such
as Maryland Washington DC Richmond
Alexander Virginia the Carolinas
Kentucky Missouri and also all the
routes that were transverse by water the
Mississippi coming around the Atlantic
Ocean up to New Orleans and then France
transporting from New Orleans up to
Natchez which is up the river in the
Mississippi area Natchez is essentially
coming from New Orleans up to Natchez or
down the river from st. Louis Missouri
and Kentucky would have you to notch to
NASA Vicksburg Natchez and you are
Baton Rouge and being sold in those
markets so that&#39;s what this particular
panel talks about and as we go around in
the alphabetical order panel four panel
for talks about and slay people so that
the Fox will road was sold down the
according to the map that we just showed
you and we have an example of an option
that might have taken place in the upper
south as well as a map that talks about
soul making dollars making money sold
down the river in the 1830s we have ads
from the dealers and trafficker that
talks about enslaved people for sale at
the frocks of the road 1840s 1850s and
into the 1860s they were not necessary
in Natchez at the fo&#39;c&#39;sle row so land
auction blocks but in a an assembly
situation where one could go and inspect
person who for sale and if they had some
interest in and they would be taken to a
private location and at the market place
where there could be intimately examine
and what-have-you in terms of the buyers
Pamela five gets into the real heart and
testimony what was happening at the
folks of the road marcasite who sold and
brought in bargain slave people at the
Fox market we actually have on this
pound copies of original handbills that
were signed by the enslaved for example
this lottery shows a bill of sale from
Theophilus Freeman from New Orleans the
opera&#39;s freedmen in 1836 was operating
in Natchez at the forks of the road but
also the appellee Freeman in 1842 was
the same deal in your land who so
Salomon knocked off of twelve years of
slavery would have so if you want to
actually see some proof of what was
going on at the folks of the road we
have the the copies of the actual bill
to say Oh most of the historians who
have reported on the enslavement traffic
the chatter enslavement traffic never
really put specific Bills of sale they
might write about them with but these
are the actual copies of them as such
and so I wanted to be more emphatically
clear and demonstrated about what
happened at the forks of the road so we
put these bills of sales about who
bought that right for and who sold pala
five-a who sold and bought and played
people at the Fox market here we have a
chart that I&#39;ve developed that shows a
history of different enslavers who are
selling at the frocks of the world and
different people in slavers who who lil
got ancestors at the fox of the road who
some of those ancestors were and what
where they were distribute to in the
Mississippi Louisiana area and what
would you hear that happen another item
we have an example of 1859 bill of sale
that not only give you the list of the
enslaved person sold by this deal of a
Blackwell Murphy and Ferguson from
but we have the whole names of the
enslaved people who were ill gotten and
the prices that they brought not only
that did the description of black yellow
or brown that&#39;s why we began to get this
color description and was heavy so as we
move on in the exhibit travel if we&#39;re
touring we want to take a look at Calais
six we&#39;re looking at Palace six that
says new masters new overseers new rules
for making slaves and we have here an
diaries are the enslavers who wrote
about the rules for making and freight
persons and where weapons took place and
make people in straight people pick more
cotton whatever it is that they had to
do as a regular forced labor the
punishment for not getting a dot or not
getting enough of it done we have it
taken actually from the the diaries of
the in flavors and this shows the
picture of a hospital for treating and
slave doing child slavery days at the
fox of the world so if you were going to
take a look as you continue to tour the
exhibit we get to panel seven and the
title of Penance 7 is habits is
everything for making cotton king in the
natural reason and what we do here is we
take some more information out of the
diaries of and in the entries out of the
reports on would help you about the
goings-on on a particular plantation
this refer for example tells me just in
flavor the sujay people here in the
plantation in in Natchez in Louisiana
says on June 1854 the the nineteen
nineteen people were prowling three were
carrying water a gang of 3200 and cotton
and Sam Edmund and ELISA and Martha was
work with Leslie they say Sam Lewis was
sick but Edmund and ELISA are Eliza
Martha and were runaways as such and so
you can get to see what&#39;s coming out of
the particular logs or work logs or
history that was being kept daily on
this particular panel we move on to
panel eight and it talks about surviving
rules and laws of playmaking in the fox
when enslave ancestors of abroad
encamped captivity from the upper South
Maryland Virginia in those places
Kentucky Missouri they they had to be
brought into a new area of the south
where they had to learn what the habits
were learned how to get along with the
new masters learn to work in hot summer
long days in place in areas of the south
of the Lower Mississippi area that they
hadn&#39;t been used to another time so they
have to survive all these type of new
new situations and our people did
survive these areas many ran away all
the way to Canada to Mexico some ran
away back to where they were enslaved
and so on but essentially the pastor of
the essences is that the enslaved people
coming from the upper low South had to
eventually find ways to survive in the
Old South that was different from the
conditions in what happier that they had
been enslaved in and moving on around to
towards the the last of some of the
panels panel number nine Mississippi
River in the fox of the road region a
major underground railroad Freedom House
and what this panel does what I tried to
do with this panel is to kill the legacy
of the myth that was enslaved people
were sold down the river they couldn&#39;t
asleep you know they didn&#39;t know the
terrain all of these kinds of myths that
historians have written about as to why
enslaved people in the deep south
couldn&#39;t escape well that was what they
call now very popular fake news because
the newspapers and other Diaries and
other sources showed that our ancestors
ran away constantly all the time going
north south east west they went by river
they they they ran away from and sought
their freedom
with their feet and we are hoping that I
can they eventually publish some of the
research to show I&#39;ve developed a matrix
that shows the runaways were women
children people who worked in the big
house where they call field hands house
hands has such an all kinds of people
even people who were sons and daughters
of enslaved people
the issue was freedom and we can never
emphasize the extent to which our people
went to to try to get the freedom if it
was only temporary so so we move on to
panel ten and it talks about my campaign
and Mississippi and Natchez and what
I&#39;ve been doing for the last twenty four
years here coming up with the story
about what our ancestors impact was in
reference to being sold and their
efforts to seek freedom equal history
commemoration advocacy and planning
efforts are preserving the folks of the
rule site essentially what it says here
is gives you an image of where the site
was located and it talks about my
efforts for the last twenty four going
on 24 years of preserving the site
resurrected in the history and making it
public non carrying on activities
libation living history plays and other
kinds of means of letting the public
know and eventually here in 2018 decided
the frocks of the road that was
enslavement market site is going to
become part of the Natchez National Park
Service so and 24 years of work
individually collectively and otherwise
of working to preserve the story of our
ancestors the site of my ancestors will
inflate and their contribution to making
Mississippi and Mississippi and Natchez
Louisiana and other places part of
the American process and success this
story is now going to be enshrined in
the National Park Service and the
federal government is going to have to
start telling about the human history
and the impact of the Carroll
enslavement and the contributions of our
ancestors who were enslaved so finally
we get to the final panel and it&#39;s
called events at the forks of the road
and connecting parts on the Underground
Railroad essentially what this panel
does is to show you pictures and images
of a variety of times over the last 23
years where we&#39;ve had events at the
folks of the road to highlight the
history for example here&#39;s congressman
Bennie Thompson who is elected to the US
Congress from Mississippi whose village
in the folks of the road we talked about
Emancipation Proclamation or Underground
Railroad type of activity we have here a
panel that shows US Colored Troops
these are reenactors who react in the
story what happened during the Civil War
and our people self emancipated that is
they ran away to become behind Union
lines to get their freedom and many of
them became freedom fighting Union
soldiers we call that kind of thing
Underground Railroad activity and we
help over in this particular part of the
panel information about the Underground
Railroad Network the freedom program of
the Park Service and their interest and
helping us to tell the story here in
Mississippi here in NASA so folks this
is what my folks are the road traveling
exhibition essentially is about it gives
you details and more work with educates
you even more so about the folks of the
road and the dealings and traffic and
the history that of child slavery that
took place at the front row I like to
say that the front row
the story of what the enslavers did to
our people and the blacks the x-ray the
runaway enslaved people self emancipated
who became civil war freedom fighters
tells the story of what we did to the
enslaved but how our ancestors helped to
destroy a chattel slavery make 13 14 15
Amendment freedom constitutional freedom
amendments of possible by helping to
defeat the South the exhibitors are
available for showing at other locations
and venues if you interested in that
we&#39;re at the Natchez Convention Center
and the exhibit has been up since
January of this year 2018 and the
comments that have been coming from the
tourists from all over the world is that
it&#39;s a great exhibit I enjoyed it
loved it excellent awesome and on and on
or those kinds of comments as they and
it helps to open up the heads and ideas
people here in the tourism industry who
have been afraid to really talk about
child slavery in Natchez and I thank the
people who have helped me in the past
with the struggles and and the struggle
