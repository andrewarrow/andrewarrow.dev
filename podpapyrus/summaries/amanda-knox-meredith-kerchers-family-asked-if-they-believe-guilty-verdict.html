<li>The verdict was expected by the family, though they knew there would be a council appeal regardless of the decision</li>

Lyle Stephanie um let me ask you first
of all what you made of the verdict last
night um I think in deep down I thought
it was going to go that way um obviously
I had no way of really knowing that
bearing in mind that was the initial
decision which was then acquitted and
obviously overturned um and I think I
said to people at the time um going into
this we were well aware that there would
be a councel appeal no matter what last
night&#39;s decision was um which is why you
know I was perhaps a bit nonplused when
the actual decision came out um and the
other thing of course for us is although
Stephanie has some Italian language
background I don&#39;t um and in that
courtroom it&#39;s obviously all very tense
it&#39;s read out very quickly um and it
actually takes a few seconds for for us
or me personally to even get a
translation of what a decision is so and
Stephanie what do you make of Amanda
noox saying already there&#39;s no way I&#39;m
coming back to Italy they&#39;ll have to
drag me off kicking and
streaming um I think we&#39;re in a
difficult position at the moment because
there are so many steps in this system
that it&#39;s not been confirmed it&#39;s not
the end um and as L said it could have
gone either way yesterday and I was
quite prepared for that um especially
seeing as it will go to another level
however without knowing what the final
answer is going to be it&#39;s difficult to
know how anyone&#39;s going to feel or react
um and really when it comes down to it
if they are found guilty at the very end
of the case and she doesn&#39;t come back
here then that&#39;s going to be for Italy
and America to to kind of decide what
they&#39;re going to do do with that because
as La said um previously if they&#39;re
convicted and they are guilty of
murder they need to be somewhere not
just free in America or Italy um so must
be difficult for you though this has
been going on the best part of seven
years now and still it&#39;s not over yeah
absolutely um yeah I&#39;ve said before that
you know the way that Meredith was
killed is obviously horrific um we&#39;ve
not really had a chance to properly
grief her because of this whole process
been going on so long there&#39;s obviously
been so much attention on the defendants
and the case itself um rather than
Meredith as the victim um and yeah
absolutely you know the fact that it&#39;s
in a foreign country a lot of it&#39;s
obviously in a foreign language we&#39;re
having to read interpretations of stuff
secondhand and on top of that the fact
that it&#39;s been been as you say sort of
knocking on into seven years now and the
next verdict in this is going to be
spring 2015 makes it very difficult for
us to sort of you know finally draw a
line of things and move on meanwhile of
course Meredith ker your sister is
almost forgotten as you say in all of
this it&#39;s all become about Amanda Knox
particularly if she gets to see this
what would you say to
her I don&#39;t know that we have anything
specific to say to anyone that&#39;s in
question at the moment um but in general
with regards to you saying about
Meredith being forgotten I think she has
been forgotten very much so in this case
because it does very much focus on the
trial rather than the victim at the
moment um
however there are a lot of people out
there who still send messages um still
donate to the fund still talk about her
we&#39;re very much in touch with Meredith&#39;s
friends um and as a family we all
remember her together so she&#39;s
definitely not forgotten but I think
that the focus has been shifted in the
case and in the media from actually as
La said how horrific this crime is
what&#39;s actually happened to MZ the fact
she was only 21 um and it could happen
to someone else just as easily and I
think that&#39;s almost the most important
part to remember that actually we need
to find out what
happened you seem very measured about
this this was your sister we have a
woman who&#39;s been convicted twice now of
her murder sitting on the west coast of
America saying I&#39;m not coming back I&#39;m
not going to serve another day of this
28 and a half year sentence how does
that make you
feel well sorry I was going to say um I
I think part of the reason we&#39;ve we&#39;ve
tried to remain measured about it as you
say is because I think we were made
quite early on that this could be a very
lengthy process um I think as everyone
who&#39;s been following the case and any of
the details of it is aware it&#39;s a very
intricate complex um uh case and
scenario of what perhaps happened that
night there&#39;s certainly a lot of um a
lot lot of question marks I suppose at
the moment still over what precisely
happened and from our point view you
know we&#39; very much supported the as I
said before the prosecution and the
legal team the sance they&#39;ve taken on it
um and the decision that they&#39;ve made so
from our point of view while we fully
supported on them that um we&#39;re well
aware that it it could have taken some
time decisions could have gone either
way um you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult
to sort of um 100% expect one thing to
happen or the other um um and I think
you you you kind of have to sort of sit
almost um across the middle of those two
until there is a final conclusion on it
really okay I ask you both a final
question do you think Amanda Knox and
Rafael solicito killed your sister and
do you think either of them will ever
end up back in jail I think that&#39;s a
very difficult question for us to answer
at the moment because as L said there
are still so many things being
investigated needing to be confirmed
that we aren&#39;t judges we&#39;re not jury and
we&#39;re certainly not detectives so it&#39;s
difficult for us to
know what&#39;s fact what&#39;s fiction other
than what we are told um and that is all
that we can go by um it obviously
suggests that that is the truth and that
they are guilty seeing as it&#39;s been
upheld again this time but equally it
was overturned last time so we may never
know exactly what&#39;s happened but given
the fact that the Italian legal system
is so thorough and there is another
stage um we would hope that they will be
able to find find out even if not
exactly what happened that night just to
be 100% sure who is
guilty and do you think they ever good
J uh it&#39;s hard to say um you know
obviously a lots being said at the
moment of of expedition you know if if
last night&#39;s decisions upheld in Spring
2015 um as I said before um I&#39;d be
surprised if if America didn&#39;t cooperate
with an extradition um you know if they
have a mutual agreement on this and
America seek to extradite criminals from
other countries themselves um I&#39;d find
it strange if they didn&#39;t cooperate in
that that sense and obviously Sol to
himself being a an Italian national
already in the country and and already
had his passport um taken from him um I
don&#39;t I don&#39;t see how you could have
somebody convicted of of what as I said
is such a horrific crime we&#39;re not just
talking of you know a drunk driver here
killing somebody um I can&#39;t see how
somebody couldn&#39;t go to prison for
