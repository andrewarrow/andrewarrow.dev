<li>Being sober makes it harder to have conversations you don't genuinely want to have, especially when people are pitching AI platforms or networking aggressively at parties</li>
<li>The LA party scene can be overwhelming, with loud music, networking pressure, and people you haven't seen in years trying to reconnect over past wild behavior</li>
<li>It's challenging to balance supporting friends at their events while staying true to your current peaceful lifestyle and avoiding toxic social situations</li>
<li>When someone lies about something you told the complete truth about, it's extremely triggering and frustrating, but responding calmly is more effective than screaming</li>
<li>Choosing peace over drama is much harder but ultimately more rewarding than being reactionary and impulsive in conflicts</li>
<li>The quiet person typically wins arguments - yelling and insulting people causes others to stop listening to your actual points</li>
<li>Early YouTube success (like making $4,900 from AdSense) provided crucial validation for creators who felt unsupported by family and peers</li>
<li>Having supportive partners who stay calm during emotional moments helps balance out dramatic tendencies and provides grounding</li>
<li>Old influencer drama and feuds often involved people acting out of insecurity, fear of losing relevance, and financial desperation rather than genuine conflict</li>
<li>The pressure to fill rooms at events for social media appearances can override the desire to have intimate gatherings with people you actually care about</li>
<li>Maintaining authenticity while being calculated about public statements is a difficult balance - being too filtered makes content less engaging</li>
<li>Long-term friendships in the influencer space require mutual respect, genuine support, and the ability to hype each other up consistently</li>
<li>Transitioning from party culture to a quieter lifestyle often reveals who your real friends are versus who was just along for the chaotic ride</li>
<li>Physical health issues like breast implant illness after 20 years highlight how normalized potentially harmful procedures have become in society</li>
<li>The 2-minute habit formation theory suggests starting new routines with just 2 minutes daily for 21 days to build sustainable habits</li>
<li>Manifestation and visualization can be powerful tools for achieving goals, as evidenced by pregnancy success stories and career achievements</li>
<li>Having a creative outlet and passion project (like writing a book) provides fulfillment beyond social media validation and monetary success</li>
<li>True friendship involves seeing and celebrating the small details about someone, making them feel comfortable and loved for who they authentically are</li>

It&#39;s harder without alcohol to have
conversations that you genuinely don&#39;t
want to have. Like someone&#39;s jaws
swinging on and they&#39;re like, &#34;This new
AI platform is going to change your
life.&#34; And it&#39;s like,
&#34;I actually conversation that happened.&#34;
I remember my takeaway being like, &#34;Wow,
I think that if I was a man, he would
have like tried to fight me.&#34; Like that
was what his like scary
like. At least that&#39;s what my perception
of that was.
All right, here we are.
Welcome to Baddies Are Trending.
Trendy Batties.
Trendy Batty is because Amari and Devon
have their crop shirts right now.
They&#39;re showing a little Vline. They&#39;re
So funny, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s They were
oversized and they cut them themselves
to be the belts.
What did Amari just say? Martha Stewart
DIY Baddy.
DIY Batty. Yes. And twink death is the
other one we just learned.
Yes. Twink.
Whenever I&#39;m Mario&#39;s facial hair, all
his comments are twink death.
I love it. That should be the merch. I
like the vibes day. It&#39;s early. It feels
It&#39;s like not early, but it feels early.
I know. It does. It
is early. I guess
I was asleep like 20 minutes ago. I
swear to God. Like I just I woke up. I
like got glammed so fast. I was wearing
this yesterday.
Well, you&#39;ve been going. You said this
is an outfit that&#39;s been 24 hours in the
making. Have not taken it off.
Sometimes when you like an outfit, you
absolutely have to just run it back
over and over and over again. What were
you doing in the past 24 hours in this
outfit? Well, you know what&#39;s funny?
Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s so funny because I&#39;ll
say anything ever. The only time I can&#39;t
say anything, it&#39;s because someone else
the only time you wore this outfit
yesterday was for that specific thing
you can&#39;t talk about
because I have like a low. Okay. I think
that I think that like
the mass of my is in the bottom of it.
So, when I wear tops like this, it&#39;s
kind of like classier. It like deletes
You are giving classy in that.
It&#39;s not like cleavage.
Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s so funny. Your boobs do
look different every top that you wear.
Like sometimes unless
unless they&#39;re pushed up cuz like that&#39;s
where the mass of my is is like in the
bottom of my
Oh my god, I love them. I want to get We
I was just talking with Literally Bunny
yesterday about uh expplanting and I
want to get mine out.
Yes, we were talking about that.
Did we talk about that?
Yeah, we talked about it too. I think on
one of these episodes.
Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. But are you doing it?
Yeah. I think I really have to now cuz I
really do think they&#39;re like making me
sick. And yeah, we did talk about this
is giving me deja vu cuz I do love all
the like 20-year-olds doing it for
themselves cuz like that was the thing.
But after 20 years, I think it&#39;s time to
get these out. They slowly kill you
after 20 years.
If that which is so crazy that something
is so normalized in society that&#39;s like
slowly killing you. I mean, they look
good, but like you know,
right? And I I never want anyone to like
think that I would still get them, but I
don&#39;t want to be in another 10 years
getting surgery at 50 to like
So, I am going to get them. Bunny showed
me her before and after and she got a
fat transfer. I don&#39;t know if she got a
fat transfer, but she said you can get a
fat transfer into your boobs. I think
that&#39;s so belly into boobs. That&#39;s so
Oh, we already talked about that. I
know. We were going to talk about
something. Oh, you want you were like
I&#39;ll tell you on the podcast. It&#39;s Oh,
was it the tart the party?
Oh my god, Trisha. I just Oh my god. I
it&#39;s I literally was on a tangent the
other day yelling and I was like, &#34;This
is why Trisha doesn&#39;t go to This is why
Trisha like I was like losing it because
I love that.&#34; No, like you are you go to
the things that are important and that
you want to go to, but you are selective
when it comes to the things that you
attend in Los Angeles for your piece.
And I
idolize that. Like I truly I want to
emulate that in every way. And it&#39;s like
just oh my god. Like
was it a party you were going to or the
party you&#39;re throwing that you&#39;re over?
I It&#39;s um parties I went to. Like I went
to two and both of them were for my
friends. So, I&#39;m going to like support
two of my like best friends for their
events. And it was nothing to do with
them as people. It was just like the LA
crowd that pours into these parties.
Like, I just can&#39;t believe there was
ever a time in my life that I would
attend a party like five times a week
and like be around all of these people.
And I&#39;ve been gone on tour. So, I just
really like have been out of the LA
scene. And like I&#39;m back in LA and I&#39;m
trying to like honestly reintegrate
myself into my life. like, you know,
just like see the people that I love and
even like figure out new things that I
enjoy doing in this era. Like I&#39;ve I
started a trivia group. Like we go to
that&#39;s where I&#39;m at. Trivia, bowling,
movies. Like that&#39;s who I am these days,
you know. But obviously if your friend
is doing something, you know, like Trevy
just released a song that was one of
them. Brooke released a um
the hair.
Yes. A hair product. And so I like I
love them both and I have to like go and
show up and support my friends and like
it&#39;s nothing to do with them or even
like our close friends. It&#39;s just like
the people that you haven&#39;t seen in so
long and the last time you saw them was
like at a party like I walked into
Trevy&#39;s party I think and someone come
came up to me and they were like we were
doing in so and so&#39;s apartment like 3
years or like whatever.
Yes. And I was like you&#39;re probably
right that probably was me.
Don&#39;t remind me. I don&#39;t want to know.
like and it&#39;s just it&#39;s crazy cuz so
many people are still obviously there
and like
I don&#39;t know it just like I&#39;m throwing
this party too for my like Tarte lip
product and it made me really cuz like
you see the guest list and it&#39;s like oh
I need 200 people there like whatever
the amount of people is for the thing
200 is crazy that&#39;s like a wedding
that&#39;s what I know and I used to throw
500 people that like I used
500 yes like no question I would just be
like your phone you&#39;re like texting 500
people Mhm. Well, Meg&#39;s helping me.
Yeah. Yeah. But I guess yeah, people
bring people, but
And like Yeah, people bring people and
whatever, but like I&#39;m at this point
where I&#39;m like I would rather it be 25
people that I love and like but then it
doesn&#39;t look like full in the pictures.
Do you ever think about that? Like even
for my kids birthdays, I&#39;m like is it
going to sound full when people are
saying birthday? Which is like so
stupid. Like you know, and it&#39;s such an
internet thing cuz like I really don&#39;t
care. I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s like three
people. But it is like a thing you think
cuz even for Elvis&#39;s we took pictures
before but everyone like you know not
everyone like two people will be like
there&#39;s no one at the party and so then
I have to show like the happy birthday
and here everyone singing like no there
were like 30 people here I don&#39;t want to
show them. It&#39;s so dumb though like why
you have to prove yourself. So funny.
Like it&#39;s like why are you commenting
that you think no one&#39;s at a kid&#39;s
birthday party,
right? It&#39;s because of the kids party.
Like yours is like a launch. So it&#39;s
like obviously you&#39;re trying to do it
for promotion but like a kids party like
with a
like touch grass like
I mean it&#39;s also like proving like
putting the happy birthday song on
listen you can hear the people but but
like no you&#39;re so real cuz it is this
like where I&#39;m like okay I need to fill
the room but I want to be like selective
cuz I want to enjoy myself and like just
like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s very interesting
and I want to be the supportive friend
still right like I&#39;m so proud of Brooke
and I&#39;m so proud of Trevy but like the
like party scene can be like so much.
What was it? What was like the
I&#39;m just sober, I think, is like
obviously one thing. I hate yelling over
loud music.
You&#39;re like You&#39;re like my age. You&#39;re
like a 37. You&#39;re like a millennial.
Just like over loud music. I love it.
My head hurts. I can&#39;t hear myself. Why
are you playing EDM right now? Like it&#39;s
just like we don&#39;t like I don&#39;t know. I
hate that. And it&#39;s like so funny
because there are LA events where like
it feels worth it and all of these
things and like you want to go maybe
network a little like maybe meet some
people and like whatever but then it&#39;s
like oh my just when like random people
are cornering you to network about
something like that just like so much
anxiety and it&#39;s like a lot.
Uhhuh. Like I feel like you&#39;d be good at
it though. I&#39;ve never been out in like a
social setting with you so I don&#39;t know
but I feel like you&#39;re like so good at
like smooing.
I think if I want to be in the
conversation I&#39;m like yeah. And no
matter what, I&#39;m going to always be like
so nice to people. But it&#39;s I think it&#39;s
harder without alcohol to have
conversations that you genuinely don&#39;t
want to have. Like someone&#39;s jaws
swinging on and they&#39;re like, &#34;This new
AI platform is going to change your
life.&#34; And it&#39;s like,
is that an actual conversation that
And it&#39;s just like, come on. I don&#39;t
want to be an AI robot.
You need a tequila soda for those, you
know? Like it&#39;s just like
that sounds awful. I&#39;ve never had that.
I don&#39;t know what that
I mean I never will again but like
soda sounds crazy.
Yeah. With a little lime kind of nasty,
And you have like no um I mean I know
you&#39;re like not an alcoholic, but you
have like no temptation to like drink.
You&#39;re like I&#39;m so good.
No, I think it&#39;s like even if I do, I&#39;m
just well aware that the like consily
outweigh the pros. You know what I mean?
Like of course in that moment where
someone&#39;s jaw pitching their AI to me, I
wish I could take a shot, but I can&#39;t
take one shot, you know? So it&#39;s like
can you say no to that kind of thing or
they&#39;re like so out of their mind so
you&#39;re like yeah yeah we&#39;ll do it and
then just like never follow up.
That&#39;s kind of my new thing has been my
email&#39;s in my Instagram bio.
Oh my poor manager.
Oh good.
That&#39;s good. That&#39;s a good one actually.
Just email me it&#39;s in my in
it&#39;s not happening
cuz that&#39;s the thing too. You want to
always like
I don&#39;t know. I just feel such a like
pressure to always like make sure the
other person doesn&#39;t feel uncomfortable
or like you know what I mean like had
has a good night like that I was nice
and like I never want to be rude to
someone ever. That is like the one
thing. So it&#39;s like if I go out to
things especially things like that like
I know I&#39;m subjecting myself to maybe
I&#39;m not going I might not have the most
fun but I&#39;m being a good friend and I&#39;m
listening to people pitch their AI
platforms.
You never know too. Maybe the AI
platform is going to be huge or
something.
It&#39;s true. It&#39;s true.
I rarely network, but the like two times
I went out last year to like events in
LA, I was like, &#34;Yeah, I met people that
like actually like came through and
stuff.&#34; Like I would listen to them talk
and I&#39;d be like, &#34;Oh, yeah, right,
whatever.&#34; And then like literally a
month later like a big thing came
through them.
It depends too cuz there are certain LA
parties where it is like I&#39;m happy to be
there and like enjoying the
conversations I&#39;m having or meeting
people that I really like, you know what
I mean? They&#39;re so talented and I&#39;m so
like, you know what I being enamored by
or whatever it is or like the
networking. It just it just depends.
Sometimes you walk into a party and
everyone&#39;s just the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah. Especially influencer ones.
Or like I swear sometimes it&#39;s like
something&#39;s in the air and people are
just extra clout hungry. Like extraing
hungry tiger and then I&#39;m like
doing this all night and I&#39;m like but
that&#39;s that&#39;s LA. You know what I mean?
Do you find yourself knowing the
influencers or do you think they&#39;re all
like younger or you know all them
basically?
I kind of know. I like really keep up
and I&#39;ve like lived so many lives that
it isn&#39;t like necessarily like people
are strangers. It&#39;s more like they have
known past versions of me, you know what
I mean? Like and I was like in a
different space, you know, cuz like
drunk me would be like matching them
talking about that AI platform all night
or like you know what I mean? Just doing
all the crazy things. So I I definitely
just like have made my rounds in LA.
That would be so Yeah, that to me that&#39;d
be like my biggest fear is like running
into people. Like I said, I don&#39;t even
know if people my age are still
influencers. Like I really do think and
I don&#39;t even think of that in a bad way.
I&#39;m like we were talking about like the
Tyler Oakland and the Grace Hall. I&#39;m
like maybe they just made so much money
they&#39;re just like I don&#39;t need to do
this anymore.
I think what I love about you and I is
like we&#39;ll probably do this in certain
capacities for the rest of our lives.
I don&#39;t know. I always say this. I don&#39;t
know what people do. Like even if I was
like like I love the lottery and I and I
always say I&#39;m going to win the lottery
but even if I won like I was like yeah
we&#39;ll just like take a year off. And was
like you would never you would make
5,000 more music videos. He&#39;s like,
&#34;You&#39;ll build more sets and more houses
and like it&#39;ll just be like I&#39;ll buy a
TV station for us to put not love line.&#34;
You know what I mean? Like
just something
that&#39;s so I love how like he knows you
so well cuz it&#39;s so true.
And it&#39;s probably true cuz I do love
like music videos like things that cost
money. I&#39;m like, &#34;Yeah, I probably still
like We&#39;re also passionate about this.&#34;
You know what I mean? Like we love that.
We love the output. We love like
serving like doing something iconic.
Well, I also love Did you say output or
input just now?
What does that mean? Cuz I was going to
yes, yes, I love the output to get the
input back. Like I love reading
comments. Like I can&#39;t even imagine.
Like it&#39;s so weird to me when people
don&#39;t post. Like I&#39;m like, don&#39;t you
want like comments? Don&#39;t you want to
see what people are saying about you
today? Like it&#39;s so fun. I don&#39;t know.
It is so fun. It&#39;s so It&#39;s hard though.
I like teeter a line cuz it&#39;s like
I love them and I do and take them, but
I have to like really be so careful to
not place too much of my value in them.
Of course. Yeah.
Cuz it is like a fine line. Like I can
look back at some eras of my life where
like that view number, those comments
like literally defined who I was and
you know what I mean? Like I get I have
to like walk this tight rope with that.
You know,
I&#39;m in an era of good comments. Like
knock on wood. Like I have like really
good comments. I&#39;m like obsessing over
them cuz like wow I get so much love.
like you deserve it so much. Like it&#39;s
it&#39;s just cool that you&#39;re in this. Oh,
stop it.
Well, that&#39;s what I was saying about
like meeting someone from my past. It&#39;s
like not even that they would say
anything. It&#39;s just like would I
immediately like get triggered? You know
what I Like I just see, you know how
like sometimes you just see a person
even online and I like weirdly get
triggered. Like it is hard for me. We
talk about like hot topics, but like
talking about like a David or something
that pops up. I&#39;m like I weirdly get
triggered. Like I can&#39;t even watch a
vlog for hot topics cuz I&#39;m like weirdly
triggered over something that happened
six years ago.
I agree with that. Oh my god. I actually
I&#39;m debating that like segueed me into
something that I like want to talk about
but I don&#39;t know if I do.
Okay. Is it like can you like
generify it?
Okay. Let me let me let me try to to to
Chris Jennerify it to like be PR safe.
I&#39;m okay.
Jeff Whitick posted a podcast recently
with Todd Smith or See here I am going
I know I Yeah,
I&#39;ve been fighting demons. Okay, I can
say this. I can say this. I&#39;ve been
fighting demons
to like not be old me. I like I
Oh, yeah.
It&#39;s And I like I do so good with it
now, you know? truly like just not
bringing things up and whatnot,
but it
it&#39;s not fair for me, I guess, to maybe
be this way, but like one of my triggers
as a person is when someone lies on
something that I just told the complete
and utter truth about. Like, you know
what I mean?
Oh my god.
And you know where I wanted to go. I
wanted to bring up the pool. I wanted to
like say all the things and like
you just didn&#39;t
I know
you have been on that and it&#39;s it I know
exactly how you feel cuz it&#39;s like that
that&#39;s happened to me like very few
people have like lied about me you know
what I mean like because for me like you
it&#39;s easy to find out the truth about
something right so like when someone has
like lied about it is so frustrating and
there&#39;s no like arguing there&#39;s no
amount of like competing or trying to
convince people because it&#39;s just a lie
like you can&#39;t even like
yeah it&#39;s hard and you don&#39;t want to
break your streak either of not
reacting. You know what I mean? That&#39;s
how I feel. I feel like I haven&#39;t
reacted to people. People try to push
and trigger and I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, I don&#39;t
want to break the streak because of like
one thing that like really irritates
me.&#34; But if they do those and then it&#39;s
like, &#34;But that&#39;s not the truth.&#34; And
it&#39;s so hard to like
It&#39;s so hard.
But as just like professional yappers
and people I feel like who have been
pretty honest about and like authentic,
like it&#39;s just like and why would I lie
about you? Like if I was even at that I
feel like a Tuesday for me in that era
of my life was more interesting. You
know what I mean? Like the that was
genuinely happening to me. I didn&#39;t have
to make anything up. I was inserting
myself into everything. I was tornadoing
my way through life like was just that&#39;s
why canceled like ended up being what it
was because was just constantly
happening because I was like everything
was for the plot and I was insane. I if
I was going to lie about someone, I
would lie about Jeff Basos, not Todd
Smith or David or something.
Yeah. I mean, and he just Yeah, he came
on and like I&#39;ll probably end up going
on Jeff FM and then eventually like
talking about it, I guess. But like
did you text Jeff in that moment? Are
you like
I texted Jeff that I literally like said
horrible things? Not about Jeff. I
Nothing I said to Jeff was horrible to
Jeff, but
how you felt?
Yeah. I was just like and Jeff already
knew and like he definitely like had my
back. I&#39;m not blaming Jeff at all. Like
you know what I mean? Like
he loves stir the pot.
Yes. And just like
it&#39;s go on to Jeff anymore. The minute I
sat down he cut it out obviously but
he&#39;ll like ask stuff right away and I&#39;ll
be like I not answering this like we&#39;re
cutting all of this right now.
He is like yes he is like he knows he
knows how to
and get those clips and say the crazy
and that&#39;s what I love about Jeff. You
know what I mean? Like I admire that
about him. He is just so like ruthless.
You know what I mean? And it&#39;s like
iconic. I could never do it in this day
and age cuz I&#39;ve chosen peace. But
but choosing peace is that&#39;s what I was
going to say. It&#39;s so much
harder. It&#39;s so much harder. But it you
feel better cuz ah the lies are awful.
But it&#39;s like and it&#39;s like ah just
having the lies out there is bad. But
the peace you feel is like so much
better to not have to like go.
It&#39;s so true. And like what am I doing
like stooping to that level and like
trying to prove myself? Like I know
exactly what happened that night. You
know what I mean? Like I know.
Yeah. And that&#39;s like I have to just sit
with that piece. And it&#39;s not even
it&#39;s not even drama. It&#39;s not even like
I&#39;m like receiving a bunch of comments
about it or there&#39;s a bunch of clips.
It&#39;s genuinely like a more like personal
thing where I&#39;m just like damn like
that is not what happened. And like
it&#39;s the most frustrating. That is
frust. And like you said it could like
nobody could even see it or care. And
like this particular clip yeah no one
did except just Trish. We were always
very interested in you of course but
like most people like didn&#39;t care cuz
it&#39;s hot. You know what I mean? And it&#39;s
like, again, no shade towards top, but
he hasn&#39;t been doing anything and he
knows that. So, it&#39;s like one of those
things where it&#39;s just like so
frustrating.
I just find it so interesting. It&#39;s like
just watching PE the way everyone too
like from that community like eventually
like is like leaving it and then like I
don&#39;t and that was the interesting thing
too because it&#39;s like you&#39;ve left that
community and like is it your ego that
you still and it&#39;s funny too because
what he said was arguably like he said
he like shoved me out of the way or
something like you&#39;re that&#39;s not true.
Well then he said he didn&#39;t even touch
you. you said just put a hand up like he
blocked you or something.
That&#39;s arguably like worse in some ways
than like what actually happened. But
I&#39;m like what is it that like you&#39;re
leaving this and you&#39;re in a new era and
you&#39;re making amends with Jeff but you
still are lying like why like why
wouldn&#39;t you want to just tell the truth
about that?
The only thing I can think of like I do
pride myself on never lying about a
person cuz like I said it&#39;s very easy to
find out if you&#39;ve lied about like
anybody that I&#39;ve been friends with
whether it&#39;s Shane or David. Like it&#39;s
easy to like factually check something.
So I never like lied about a person. The
only thing you could think about and
compare it to is like I used to be a
pathological liar about like things
about myself. Like I&#39;d say my dad is
rich or whatever. And sometimes you like
start believing that own story. Like I
started believing it. You know what I
mean? I was like oh wait my dad wasn&#39;t
rich but for some reason in my childhood
I told everyone he was but you start
believing it. So maybe he was telling
everyone in his circle like what
happened and then you just kind of
believe that as like
Yeah. I guess I think he&#39;s like you got
to double down. You have a point. You do
have a point. He just really believes
it. Maybe he really believes that
happened cuz he just told so many people
that story. So he&#39;s just like, &#34;Yeah, I
guess that&#39;s true.&#34; I like I I have I
have to like have empathy, I guess, and
think about it if almost from his shoes
cuz it&#39;s like Yeah. I don&#39;t know. I just
I think it&#39;s also like I remember it so
vividly because I was like I cannot
believe this is happening. Like
oh gosh, we were just saying how much we
love SeatGeek.

today&#39;s episode. Wow. This like grown
man like you know that feeling when like
a grown man is like aggressive or like
yelling or like angry like and you just
like walk away and it&#39;s like in your
chest and you&#39;re like oh damn I am a
girl like you know what I mean? Like it
it like everything else kind of like
falls and it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t you know
what I mean? Like it doesn&#39;t matter if
you&#39;re angry or whatever. You&#39;re like oh
that like made me feel really yucky like
you know what I mean? And like I
remember that feeling and exactly what I
did like so vividly that I was just like
and you told the story so many times in
that very consistent manner of that same
thing of that like shook feeling and
it&#39;s like and you don&#39;t usually tell
stories like that like you&#39;re never
really shaken by anything you know so
cuz I was like damn like I I remember my
takeaway being like wow I think that if
I was a man he would have like tried to
fight me like that was what his like
scary like at least that&#39;s what my
perception of that was you know what I
mean like that&#39;s how I felt. I think
that&#39;s the other thing too is like when
someone says something as fact and not
like that&#39;s how well he I guess he did
say that&#39;s how he perceived things but
then Jeff was like well there&#39;s three
sides every I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know if
there&#39;s three sides sometimes there&#39;s
just the truth you know they always say
her side he said but it&#39;s like no there
is like a truth of what happened like
there is the truth
and like it&#39;s yeah I just like I
remember so vividly what he was saying
and what he was talking about cuz this
was this was in the time where I was
kind of transitioning from at one point
being Dorick&#39;s friend to like now
writing for Jeff and like I definitely
felt that you know what I mean there was
many months and like things I would go
to or things I was no longer allowed at
or like you know what I mean things that
everyone else was going to and I
couldn&#39;t or like I&#39;d walk into a room
and receive 10 looks because
I wasn&#39;t choosing what was like socially
easy you know what I mean I was choosing
what I felt to be the right thing
which obviously was cuz look at Todd you
know he&#39;s back with Jeff now and
everyone&#39;s like
and that&#39;s the thing too yeah it&#39;s like
that&#39;s so interesting because it&#39;s like
all of these people died on this hill
and then like flies eyes one by one or
cuz then what does that say? Like if
you&#39;re now sitting back with Jeff like
what does that say about how you acted
for the last few years?
Well Todd said in the interview I ended
up watching the whole thing when we
talked about Jess I had only seen clips
but then I did watch the whole thing cuz
I wanted to like get the full
perspective and Todd does admit
thank god cuz I didn&#39;t
Yeah. No, I know I didn&#39;t want to but I
was like and it is hard like things
trigger me. Todd doesn&#39;t trigger me
because literally like never talked to
him when I was like in that like world
or whatever. But
that&#39;s the thing too he was always very
quiet and just kind of nice. So, it&#39;s
it&#39;s like funny to me that in the end
like arguably he&#39;s the person that I&#39;ve
had the whatever.
No, it&#39;s it&#39;s it is very very odd. But
he does say that he knew he was on the
on Jeff&#39;s side cuz he during that time
he said he like couldn&#39;t really because
he was dating Natalie and he was
intertwined with David. So like he
couldn&#39;t really like be friends with
Jeff even though he knew. But how crazy
is that these like such like
I don&#39;t know in my opinion culty vibes.
I mean that&#39;s like the definition of a
cult. It&#39;s just like you know what I
mean? Just following someone blindly
knowing things are wrong, knowing things
are up. And he like that like income
has a play of like financial like has a
play of control and like
just and like a sense of security and
like we have you and like you know what
I mean?
I I get all of that and I mean in some
retrospect I&#39;m happy that he&#39;s like
trying to go into the light and like you
know get out of that but just damn no
I&#39;m not no I think because it triggered
but yeah what he said about you and then
you&#39;re just like I but see that&#39;s how I
get with certain people too and I just
like cannot watch because it just like
triggers me so much when people try to
push me or lie or like or like rewrite
history or something. It&#39;s just like so
frustrating. Like that&#39;s not how it
happened. But at the end of the day, I&#39;m
like, let&#39;s choose a piece because at
the end of the day, going back and forth
is just like exhausting and like
who do you want to go back and forth
with, Todd? You know what I mean? Like
it&#39;s not even worth anything. There&#39;s
literally there&#39;s nothing, you know?
It&#39;s just like shouting into oblivion.
it really is. That&#39;s a good analogy.
Like it does. It would be just shouting
into oblivion and like
like everyone knows how I feel and it&#39;s
Yeah. I always feel like with your
delivery, people think they can go like
that you want the combat. You know what
I mean? Because you are so passionate.
It&#39;s not a bad way, but you&#39;re just so
passionate with the way you talk about
things. So, I think people think
to like match the energy and they think
it&#39;s like a beef and to go back and
forth. But I also think there&#39;s
something like it is nice to just like
address something when something&#39;s wrong
too. You know what I mean? There is
something to say about that. Like when
you like if you keep this in or don&#39;t.
But I do think it&#39;s nice that you can
just like be like h that does still like
trigger me. That&#39;s frustrating cuz
that&#39;s not the truth.
This is much better than like it&#39;s so
funny cuz I I originally made a TikTok
and it&#39;s in my drafts. I&#39;ll never post
it. But like in the moment I saw the
video and I went and I made a Tik Tok
and like I am very happy I did not post
like Shane Dawson like she&#39;s a liar.
She&#39;s a liar. Everybody&#39;s like live with
Tati and just was so mad that didn&#39;t
happen that and Ryland&#39;s just like get
off get off live and then it just like
ends and like we&#39;ve all been there.
me. I&#39;m on the toilet yelling things I
don&#39;t need to be saying. It&#39;s like
And you didn&#39;t post it.
Yeah, I did. Yes. I left it in the
drafts and I&#39;m really happy.
Wow. And why like was it late at night?
Were you like, &#34;Okay, let me just see if
I feel this way in the morning or how
was it?&#34;
Yeah. Yeah. It was towards the evening
and I just already like I&#39;d done enough
that day. I felt like I was in like
internet world. Even like
I bought this book and I was filming an
unboxing of it and like I need to post
it still and like edit it, but I bought
this insane book that I&#39;m so gagged over
and in the beginning of my unboxing, I
like go on a tangent about it and it&#39;s
like you&#39;re unboxing a book.
Like it&#39;s it was just like
on your mind. I know. I&#39;ve been there
too where it just like consumes you. But
that&#39;s why like yeah I I&#39;ve been there
too and sometimes that&#39;s why it&#39;s good
when you have like a like a boyfriend or
like Moses he hears all my ranting like
I will like scream into like I&#39;ll just
like scream I&#39;ll be like I can&#39;t believe
she was like and then I&#39;m like okay let
me just be composed but sometimes you
just need that sometimes you need a a
yell a rant like are you kidding
Makoa and Moses are the best for that
cuz Makoa got an earful that day with
everything I was fed up with
his reaction is he is he like
understanding is he listening or is he
just kind of like
very understanding doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s
well we woke up that day and it was the
first thing I saw saw too. Like it was
the I opened my phone and it was the
first thing I saw and Makoa just turned
to me and he goes, &#34;What are you going
to do?&#34;
Like he knew he knew that like I what I
wanted to do and he was just like being
funny about it. But like he&#39;s just so
calm that it like reminds me and like
even the other night I like got back
from those parties and I&#39;m just like
I&#39;m realizing that one of my like
not so strong suits, one of the my
faults in my mind or headsp space, I
don&#39;t know what it is, is that I will
know someone is going to act a certain
way and then they will act that way that
I was so well aware that they were going
to act and then I will be so
disappointed and upset and then I&#39;ll be
I knew it. I knew this person was going
to let me down in this way. I like, you
know what I mean? Or just people I love
or like whatever it is, but like you
knew it. Why are you still so upset? And
then I ruminate. And like I had just
gotten back from those parties and I was
very much like ruminating like this is
not these are not the LA scenes that I
want to be in, but I still want to
support my friends. And like
just not even LA just like I just I&#39;m no
longer a partyier in that regard. Like I
just that&#39;s not who I am, but I still
want to support my friends. I have to
navigate what that is. Is it a dinner
before the event and then I go home like
you know what I mean? Just like who am I
going to be in this era? And Mico was
like like I was like seething you know
and he&#39;s like calmed like it&#39;s going to
be okay. He&#39;s very like
calm. Yeah. He calms you. He&#39;s like
you&#39;re zen. That&#39;s like the most
important person to have when you&#39;re
someone like like us just like
cuz not everyone is like that. I always
think everyone spirals and just starts
like having all the emotions. And
there&#39;s some people who truly like M and
Moses like he does not I&#39;m sure he gets
angry inside but he never shows it. He
never gets frustrated. He&#39;s never like
pent up like
I&#39;m like damn I wish I could be like
that. But sometimes you need that
reminder that&#39;s like
just take a minute
and like he really only is like upset or
about things if they&#39;re like level 10
and then still it&#39;s more so like Mako
really only will ever feel like sadness
or disappointment. Like I don&#39;t really
ever see Makoa angry like he&#39;s not like
that&#39;s Moses too and he&#39;s always just
like finds a solution, finds whatever
cuz there are and there&#39;s stuff that be
said that said about him too and he&#39;s
just like he&#39;s just calm about it. I&#39;m
like how are you not fired up? And he&#39;s
just like,
&#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; Like, &#34;Just take a minute.
Like, it&#39;s fine.&#34; Like, I don&#39;t know.
I&#39;m like, &#34;Wow, you&#39;re better than me.&#34;
I was like,
&#34;Wow.&#34; I&#39;m always I always credit it to
like the Hawaii stoner of it all. Like,
he&#39;s so like,
&#34;If it&#39;s still bothering you tomorrow,
you know, we&#39;ll take on tomorrow. It&#39;s
going to be just fine.&#34; Like, or like
I&#39;ll be ruminating and he&#39;ll be like,
&#34;Just hang it up. Just hang it up for
the night.&#34; And it&#39;s like,
I love that.
You&#39;re you&#39;re so real for that. K.
Do you feel that way then? Like, you
know, going out to the LA party is like
you almost have like you&#39;re almost not
that person anymore. you have like one
foot out the door because you have a
place in Maui now and you have a Maui
boyfriend and you have this other life
that&#39;s not LA. So you feel like a little
bit like oh I&#39;m not this anymore. I&#39;m
not being sucked into it.
100%. And then there is the flip side of
that coin too where I think it makes me
grateful for my life in LA and the
things I do enjoy. And like even like as
much as I didn&#39;t want to be socializing
with these people at like certain people
at like certain parties, I am like so
grateful to go support Brooke and I am
so grateful to support Trevy and like so
proud of them and like go trivia nights
and like you know what I mean? Know who
I want to be around and like just come
here and do this like
Hawaii and stuff. It&#39;s made me very
grateful for the things in LA and
touring even just like being home and
being like wow this is my life that I&#39;ve
created and like
and just get to like enjoy cuz you like
worked in and you&#39;re like and I can just
enjoy time off. I feel that way too cuz
it&#39;s like I love going out too in LA but
I don&#39;t feel like I have to compete in
the influencer world cuz I&#39;m like oh I
have like my family like that&#39;s what I
care about is being a mom and then I get
to do the fun LA stuff if I like want to
which I like rarely do but
yeah it&#39;s not this like I need to like
get this tonight like if I don&#39;t show up
at the party no one&#39;s going to know
about me and I can&#39;t network and I&#39;m
kind of like h it&#39;ll come or it won&#39;t
like I don&#39;t really care.
There&#39;s there&#39;s a piece in that too. I
was just like the fact that I was ever
such a little like clout demon like
blows my mind. And I&#39;d be like, I saw
Harry Jy yesterday and just like him and
I had this like era where like he&#39;d come
over and like we&#39;d scheme, you know,
it&#39;s like what are are we going to get a
paparazzi shot today? Are we going to
make these Tik Toks? I have these
I didn&#39;t know this. What?
Oh yeah.
There&#39;s a Harry Jy era with you.
Yeah, we like fake dated like I don&#39;t
even know what the I was doing.
Was that What year is this?
But um 2019 maybe 2020.
No, 2019 is Jake Paul. We established
it was like right after that. I was like
show him. Oh, really? Was it the same
year? You think maybe 2020?
And then Francesca.
Francesca. Yeah, there was
I miss era.
I found a lot of friendship with Harry
in it. Like I did cuz I like you know
what I mean? We&#39;d laugh and like have
fun and like be real friends like
through it and like I look back at it
fondly for that reason. I think like I
enjoyed our friendship throughout it.
But it&#39;s so funny that that was like I
lived next door to the Hype House, you
know what I mean? I was like what? Like
what are we going to do today? And it&#39;s
like just so crazy that I would
house was
in Hollywood Hills with the glass like
the the
several stories.
This is like Alex War and little honey.
Yes. Yes. And they were my neighbors and
I was
And you were hanging out with them.
Yes. And just like
Such an interesting time for sure to
think that I was so like
and I like my worth was based in that
too. I think it was coming off of all
the Jake stuff too and just whatever.
Like I had
learned what worked, you know what I
mean? and then like how to make money
and how to have eyes on you and like all
of those things which are valuable
lessons but like also was so consumed in
it. I think it&#39;s good to have those
tools and use them if you need them and
marketing and all of those things, but
to just become that like machine person
and like your worth, not feel
I think like a youth thing to I mean you
are very young. You just done it for a
lot longer. So like in a way you are
like 10 years aged up. But I do see that
with like younger influencers. They&#39;re
really about even streamers like
streamers are the new influencers,
right? Like all the streamers they just
did like a streamer game. They did like
a streamer. It&#39;s almost like the Disney
Channel games. We were That&#39;s how Oscar
described it to me. It was like Disney
Channel games, but it was like
streamers. I know. I was like, I&#39;m kind
of confused what was happening, but it
was like I don&#39;t know if you know any of
these names, but it&#39;s like cutie
Cinderella and Vanilla Mace and Lewig
and like all these like streamers that
are the thing. So, they all get together
and do like these collabs and stuff like
that. And it&#39;s, you know, they&#39;re all
huge and they&#39;re all making so much
money cuz they&#39;re all collabing. So, I
think it&#39;s like a young thing. You just
have that ambition to do it. Yeah. And
the newness like
the newness even like seeing Camila like
I was thinking that too like the bop
house girls and collabing with everybody
and trying to do everything and
and that just all that money is like
it&#39;s like Kool-Aid. You know what I
mean? Like I remember when I made my
first million dollars a month on it&#39;s
like I became a different person for a
second cuz it&#39;s like all you can think
about. You&#39;re like what the you mean?
Oh I was obsessed. Yeah. I was like
hardcore here I am like for sure.
And I was older. I was like 30 too when
so if I was like young and having all
this I would be the exact same way. I
think it&#39;s definitely a young thing and
I think if you&#39;re like lucky enough to
be like established where people just
you have a fan base and then you don&#39;t
have to be as like you don&#39;t have to try
as hard which is like not a bad thing
cuz I was trying hard too. I was very
similar to you. Like if I wasn&#39;t in a
group, it first was like Shane and I was
like oh my god this is great. And then
when that was like kind of filtering out
then it became like David and I was like
great and then Jeffrey and then you know
just I was trying to like cling on to
like any group you know I was going on
all these like podcasts. I went on like
impulsive trying to find like my next I
think Keen and JC I went on their show
thinking maybe this is my new group. I
was just trying to be in all these
groups. Um but yeah at the end of the
day and it does work like you said to
some degree. Obviously Shane and David
didn&#39;t bring me anything because his fan
base always hated me but you know what I
mean. It&#39;s just like I think once you
like establish yourself, you don&#39;t have
to like do it as much which
and like it was for me at least like
almost looking back like a lot of it&#39;s
insecurity driven too like what if this
goes away driven and like fear I think
fear was my biggest motivator, you know,
knowing like I had nothing to fall back
on, you know what I mean? So it was like
I have to and now I&#39;m more so like
what&#39;s meant for me will happen and
thank God for the girlies who have stuck
around and care about
who I really am, all facets of me versus
just one.
People really love you. yours
specifically. I was looking at your um
cuz you posted like a main channel
video. You were trying on like Hawaii
clothes or something and I was like,
&#34;Wow, people really My main channel like
I I love it. I still post there, but
like people don&#39;t like it&#39;s not like a
big thing anymore. Yours is but yours is
like so big still. People like love just
like you trying on clothes.&#34;
You are so sweet.
I&#39;m just trying to That&#39;s really sweet.
It means a lot to me cuz I&#39;m like very
passionate about I just love that&#39;s
always been my like thing like that. I
really love even like podcasting and
whatnot. you&#39;re kind of like you have
editors to help you and beautiful
producers and all of the like gorgeous
things, but like that&#39;s my like baby,
you know what I mean? Where I care and
JRod and I get to like sit and work on
things and it&#39;s like my passion for
That&#39;s like that&#39;s how I feel with mine.
It&#39;s like it&#39;s just mine, you know? Like
no one else is in it. I lit obviously I
don&#39;t edit, but I just like throw stuff
up there and like whatever.
About you though.
I still post. I&#39;m like, well, no one
really cares, but here I still post
music videos on there. They get like
70,000 views. But it&#39;s like I love it. I
it cuz it&#39;s just like it feels like
home. It&#39;s like the thing that brought
us this whole
life that we get to live. You know what
I mean? Like
that and like the girls that we were
when we first sat down like
you know what I mean? It was our solace
and it was the first time at least for
me like I don&#39;t want to speak for you
but like feeling heard and seen and like
oh my god like people love me for me and
like you know just like changed changed
my life.
It was a rush. I was thinking about
that. Mine was January 3rd 2007 was my
first video. So, it&#39;s like 19 years in
January. And I just remember like
posting and all my videos, my first like
50 videos were all about Quinton
Tarantino. And I just was how much I
loved him, whatever. And I remember Eli
50 videos about loving Quinton
Tarantino&#39;s iconic
poems. I was like my poem to Quinton
Tarantino. It&#39;s like me in this like
little studio with like literally a
futon behind me like it&#39;s in Hollywood.
And I did all these things. I was like I
posted them on my MySpace and I remember
Eli Roth like sending me a message and
was like, &#34;Do you want to come to this
like event? Quinton&#39;s going to be here
at his movie theater.&#34; And I remember
like going I was like 18 at the time and
like Eli sees me in the like the lobby
of the movie theater room like takes my
hand and introduces me to Quentino. He
like brings me right up to Quantino at
18 years old. And I was like all this
because I posted videos on YouTube in
MySpace and he was like so nice. It was
nothing like weird or creepy but I was
just like and even Quinton like I was
like I can&#39;t believe like that&#39;s the
reason I moved to LA and he was just
like I he was like right in front of me
because of these YouTube videos and I
thought that was the most powerful.
Isn&#39;t it crazy? Like you think about the
rush and just like what it is working
and like this. Yeah. like that I those
first feelings of like that holy this is
like a made it moment. Did you have a
moment where you&#39;re like this is it I
like made it. Is it buying something
moving out of your parents? Like is it
it was that I had to quit my job because
I really like I I loved my job. I worked
just like retail and like but I loved it
and I loved the people I worked with and
like I also like I had dropped out of
high school and that was like in my head
that was my only like out was working
this minimum wage job and making this
money and saving it and that was going
to be how I got out. So, I didn&#39;t quit
until I had like a 100,000 subscribers
or something because I was like, I I
can&#39;t like what if I this up and then I
lose this job and then like I all for
this YouTube channel and no one cares
and whatever. And then people kept like
coming in and I just like had to quit.
You know what I mean?
Wait, really? They were like looking for
Yes. And I like had to
like How old are you? Like 15, 16?
Yeah, 16 maybe. Maybe 17.
Scary. Were you scared or were you like
loving it?
I was loving it. I was like trying I
remember I tried to have a meet and
greet there and we were trying to do it
and like my manager was like yes you can
do it but then like obviously like the
it was at Pacson and like the higher up
was like no this can&#39;t do that.
Wait why why didn&#39;t they want you to
have it there? Because I think that&#39;s
like I don&#39;t know like imagine like
you&#39;re the CEO and you&#39;re like no at
this random Vegas location
like hell yeah bring those customer well
it was before I guess social media was
like that tool but I think any nowadays
people like bring those customers
are working there I&#39;m like it just like
it so funny to think about
yeah and I just like remember my boss
being like go like you got this and it
was like just my
I love that you had like a happy like
life in your like retail job
it was like my escape you know what I
mean and it like in my head it was the
only where I was going to get out of
like hell, you know what I mean? So,
and so then you got the 100,000
subscribers and are you making money on
YouTube? Yeah, that was back when
AdSense was a free-for-all.
Do you remember like I know AdSense used
to be like amazing.
Yeah. My first check was like $4,900
and I had never seen anything like it
from videos
and I remember being like, &#34;Holy&#34;
and obviously also I&#39;m living in this
house with people who like do not
believe in me or understand and I&#39;m an
only child. You know what I mean? with
your parents you&#39;re living with at this
So, it&#39;s like
it wasn&#39;t even the money. It was like
the validation of like I know this is
working and it doesn&#39;t matter and these
people have told me every day I&#39;m not
going to make it at this and to stop
doing it and like you know what I mean
like all the horrible things that like
people say you know what I mean and just
yeah it wasn&#39;t the money. It was like
knowing like holy like this this is

qualify for. Ro gives you the

Oh my god. And then did you just get
out? How old were you when you moved
Yeah. I mean, I think everything was
really hard until I was 18.
Like I ended up like trying to get a
lease and then like they had to be on it
and it was it was just this back and
forth of control and Jordan was there
granted. So I would call him freaking
out like my parents are doing this
again. They&#39;re doing this again. Like oh
my god like the cra I remember this time
I had gotten offered to go to Beauty Con
Dallas and I wasn&#39;t 18 yet and I was so
I want to cry. I was so excited and I
wasn&#39;t 18 yet, you know what I mean? So
everything was just like really like
hard and I remember my mom was like
freaking the out and she like took my
debit card, took my ID so I couldn&#39;t fly
and like remember what like conventions
were like they meant everything, you
know what I mean? And like I was so
determined to make this flight so I
start breaking everything in the house.
I&#39;m like no, I&#39;m going and you&#39;re going
to give me my ID. I was throwing plates
at the wall like on some cuz I&#39;m like
you. No, this is my opportunity. I&#39;m
going to Mog with Tila Dun. You&#39;re not
stopping me. Like the So, I&#39;m breaking
everything. And I get my And I get there
and then she shuts off my debit card.
She like goes cuz I wasn&#39;t 18 yet. So
now I&#39;m stuck. I can&#39;t get home. I have
no money. Like and I was with Isabella,
thank God. And she like her parents
ended up helping us. But like
I just remember like it was like and so
much going then.
How did your ID? Did you have an ID?
I broke everything until she gave it
back and then I got there.
So it worked. And then but yeah, but
then she went to the bank and like shut
it all off. So I was like stuck there
and it was just like
Yeah, that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s why
So wild.
Like you go to the bank to do it. It&#39;s
like okay like you already tried to
I&#39;m stuck in Dallas, Texas. You&#39;re evil.
Like I&#39;m 17 and just like it was crazy.
But like
but you made it.
Yes. And then like thank God. I mean
that&#39;s why my 18th birthday was just the
best day ever. That was kind of like
where I finally was like oh my god I&#39;m
free. Cuz that&#39;s like a narcissist.
You know what I mean? they want to
control you and like making all this
money and like success from 16 to 18. It
was so hard. I was like coming online
and being like fun about it, but like
behind the scenes that girl was
struggling cuz they didn&#39;t want to they
didn&#39;t want to, you know, not have
credit for my win or not take advantage
or money or you know all the things.
So what did they say when you were
making these videos for those two years?
Were they like supportive at some time?
Like oh that&#39;s kind of cool what you&#39;re
doing. Like it wasn&#39;t all like hell all
the time or
Yeah. I think it was more like
when they got nice things.
Yeah. Exactly. It was exactly just said
when they got nice things like I think
that eventually they were like hell yeah
lottery ticket we&#39;re going to get money
out of this but that was like kind of
electric bill.
Yeah. Oh forgot about electric bill.
We&#39;ll tell that story one of these days.
Oh but they were like you paid it and
they&#39;re like we love you.
No but they&#39;re like like gunpoint like I
had no choice. You know what I mean?
Like to like
and it&#39;s like I knew if I didn&#39;t pay
this bill for them my life would be a
living hell. So it was kind of like one
of those where
she wasn&#39;t ungrateful.
It was so it was diabolical. Truly,
that is wild. Oh my god. Yeah. Your book
could be literally just your childhood.
I know. I know.
Surviving whatever your parents&#39; names
are, you know? It&#39;s like it&#39;s crazy.
Truly. As I&#39;m like writing more and
more. I&#39;m so excited to get to like this
turning point though. You know what I
mean? Like in the book, like once I get
Are you just at the childhood still?
Yes. I&#39;m But I&#39;m getting older. I&#39;m like
getting to high school soon, which is
like that&#39;s, you know, like soon. We&#39;re
close and I&#39;ve gotten far and
wow. I&#39;m excited to get to like the fun
too. You know what I mean? Just like
Amari and I having so much fun in like
the first few years of living in LA and
stuff. But
just like retelling the stories,
diabolical.
Yeah. But 4,000 at 16 for posting videos
is actually amazing.
Do you ever miss when AdSense was just
like no parameters.
Oh my god. Yeah. I AdSense came on
later. I was on YouTube for like four
three or four years before AdSense
became a thing. But yeah, when it came
on it was great because it was like
8,000 my first month. I remember like
that&#39;s amazing. Um, but then yeah, at
the height of it, remember like it was
like Vlogmas, like December was like
AdSense month, which is like not it
anymore. I tried the past like five
December to do like vlog and I&#39;m like
there&#39;s no there&#39;s no extra money in
December. Like it&#39;s not at all.
Not for me. Have you found a different
Not at all.
Like even anyone on all of our channels,
you see me doing Vlogmas, mind your
business. I got I got to try something
cuz I tried like my ASMR channel. I was
posting three times a day on there and
then even like but just anyways. Yeah, I
was posting so much. I was like, &#34;We&#39;re
going to collect this AdSense money and
three times a day. That&#39;s so iconic.&#34;
I had nothing.
I was like, &#34;Really?&#34; Well, when Vlogmas
was happening, I was doing Vlogmas on
like three channels. But, um, yeah, I
think at that point, AdSense, you can
make like $250,000, you know, if you&#39;re
posting every day
and there was no parameters. Like, I I
can&#39;t believe I titled the video he me
with a toothbrush and made like 10
Was it 10K
or like something crazy? I don&#39;t
Say whatever you wanted. You really
didn&#39;t start those story times. Remember
everyone was doing those story times
after and like the crazier. I&#39;m sure I
did too. I&#39;m sure I made up a couple
story times. Like I&#39;m sure there was
some that I like lied and I didn&#39;t know.
Looking back at those titles, it&#39;s just
like, &#34;Oh, you diabolical.&#34;
The best. And I think everyone copied
you. I definitely did. I definitely did
like a sex with nine baseball team
members at the same time or something.
I monetized. I know.
Monetized. Yes. And I was like, damn.
Cuz yours really were
like how many Uber drivers tried to kill
you, Tamara?
Oh my god. I forgot about those series.
I was. But it&#39;s funny because it truly
was who I was. Like I was just so
goddamn dramatic. You know what I mean?
You were so good at storytelling though.
Like just like I would have like a bad
experience and I&#39;d be like this. I can&#39;t
That was Yeah. Was it for the plot? Like
you said, everything was for the plot
for sure. And you were so good. The way
you told stories were so good. Like Dan,
that was an era of YouTube.
Just such a time. And even Oh my god.
Like Yeah. I&#39;m thinking of so many
people. Even Gabby Hannah. Like she was
killing it.
She was killing the story time. Yes.
Although hers were so crazy cuz you
remember there&#39;s one that you know how
Tik Tok has the pop culture moments you
what does it say
where they do always like they have like
a little thing. She has a couple that
comes up which is icon honestly like
whatever like I like she&#39;s been gone for
a while but it kind of makes her more
iconic cuz I&#39;m like oh man remember this
era. There was one where she was telling
a story time. She you guys I&#39;m about to
tell you a story about the time my
parents impregnated me with my brother
and her intro and it&#39;s like intro and
obviously it&#39;s like a dream she had or
something but I&#39;m like that was crazy.
that&#39;s your intro. And then she has one
where she Zach&#39;s saying and she goes,
&#34;Well, I think you&#39;re fat and I think
you&#39;re ugly. That&#39;s just my opinion.&#34;
And I was like, &#34;But it&#39;s like her
saying something like how it people
think it&#39;s okay to say mean things.&#34;
Just it&#39;s like it&#39;s out of context. It&#39;s
so funny.
But so funny. I was dying laughing the
other day cuz people like make a meme
cuz these two videos came out back to
back and it was Gabby Hannah. Omar,
you&#39;re going to die. Gabby Hannah titles
the video. She&#39;s like, &#34;I wrote a song
for Trisha Pis.&#34; And then Trisha Pis
uploads 35 minutes later like, &#34;Gabby
Hannah, you are so creepy. Please stop.&#34;
I forget the exact title, but like
that was it. I think
like like what a time to be alive.
Oh my god. Send it to Jimmy so I can put
it in the B-roll cuz it was so funny.
You sent me that in the DM and it says
it&#39;s like whenever someone took the
screenshot. It was like 3 hours ago, 3
hours ago. And it&#39;s like literally hers
and then mine.
I&#39;ve apologized.
And I know too like honestly it&#39;s like
No, it&#39;s so good. I know too that like
with you not editing things instantly
and uploaded it so fast like filmed and
just like like so hold on I want to find
Yeah, that was my era of that&#39;s why
but you were kind of like like you were
valid for that, right? Like you were
valid at the time like maybe half the
stuff I was valid for and probably the
other half. No, I think with me and
Gabby it was definitely a 50/50. Like
there was definitely stuff where you
know I was I was a little nuts and then
I think there were some stuff
trying to get it to load.
Is it not working the thing?
Wait wait wait wait to Wi-Fi.
Yes. Yes.
I wrote a song for Trisha Pis. Gabby
Hannah leave me alone. You&#39;re creepy as
The place is looking so good.
Oh my god.
We were going back and forth. I remember
this. Let me see the thumbnail. This is
2020. This is like I&#39;m very pilledled
out here. This was 2020. Very pulled
out. And I would I had nobody with me.
It&#39;s quarantine. I&#39;m responding at all
hours of the night. I&#39;m putting out 30
videos a night. Like not even joking. I
was just Thank god Tik Tok wasn&#39;t around
because I would have been 50 part
Yeah. 500 videos a day.
Yeah. Like so iconic.
That was me on YouTube basically. I was
just manic posting and you know.
So but the no editing and having that
ability to just
just here it goes.
Send it is so goddamn iconic. I want to
frame that. I was and I I remember being
so livid. I was so angry like more so
than I should have been back then. Like
I was so livid. Like I don&#39;t
creepy as hell enough. Like also like
this has not I&#39;m not laughing at Gabby
Hannah at all. Like this is that just
that could be any two people and getting
it up like within the hour and like the
it&#39;s so good.
But can I tell you I went on her podcast
like a year after that because I really
was trying to make amends with her and
still to this day like I publicly
apologized at my show in Philly. I was
like I wish Gabby was here. I I know I
was being like extra like I was being
extra, you know, cuz I was just I had so
many emotions and we just we were just
we still will be just always just never
lining up, you know. But it&#39;s really
nothing it&#39;s it has nothing to do with
her or me. It&#39;s just like, you know,
some people just like don&#39;t see things
the same at all, you know? And that&#39;s
like was me and Gabby. But I was like,
overreacting so much. Like she wanted
she&#39;s like, &#34;We&#39;re friends.&#34; And I&#39;m
like, &#34;No, we&#39;re not.&#34; And like that was
our that was our beef. And I was like,
&#34;Why do I care so much that she thinks
we&#39;re friends? Why do I care so much?
You know, and maybe maybe I don&#39;t know.
she was also very passionate, you know,
like I don&#39;t know who she is now, but
like her and I never saw eye. And like
looking back though, she was right and I
was wrong. Like I think that
I sucked at timing and I was I didn&#39;t
keep my word. Like you know what I mean?
Like I&#39;d be like we&#39;re going to upload
this at this time and then I&#39;m uploading
it way like you know like I was not a
good collaborator or partner. But she
also would like like there was this time
that she brought me to her house
to cuss me the out and Hunter came with
me and I remember he like I think that I
don&#39;t know like
I don&#39;t know if I can say actually what
I was about to say. That&#39;s it. Just
that&#39;s the whole story.
She called you over said come to my
house and like can you
Yes. Yes. And like just
It was I mean I but granted like I think
she was probably just trying to get me
to wake up. You know what I mean? Like
you can&#39;t be a piece of
some people have a different approach to
things. For sure.
For sure. And I I think I&#39;ve always
sucked at that. Like that is not how I
grow. Like when people scream at me, I
think that it just reminds me so much of
my childhood that I kind of shut off.
Like especially women screaming. Like my
mom that&#39;s like she was just the most
like shrill screamer at all times to the
point that I viscerally hate it. Like
I&#39;m like oh my god. Like nothing needs
to be in like tone at all times. It&#39;s
&#34;Oh.&#34; So, what would you do? Are you&#39;re
not combative back? She scream at you.
You&#39;re like, &#34;Okay.&#34;
Uh, I don&#39;t know.
Are you Are you a screamer back or were
Probably with her in that moment? No. I
was probably like I&#39;m scared. Like it it
definitely depends. I mean, now I&#39;m not.
I&#39;m definitely like I think
I do think there&#39;s power in being not
always, but like for the most part like
the quietest person wins the argument.
Like the second someone yells, like
there&#39;s a part of me it depends on what
it is about. I guess that it&#39;s
situational, but
I almost think always like think of a
situation where the loud person wins.
Yeah. Like it&#39;s like sometime like I
just see people so often approach things
by being a screamer and it&#39;s like I was
the screamer. I&#39;m one the shouting
angry. I&#39;m angry at everybody on
YouTube. Like never once did anyone ever
listen to me because I screamed loud.
You know the only time people start
listening to me is when I like to take
it back a notch, you know? Like oh
Trisha was saying something here. You
know what I mean? And it&#39;s like I do
think there&#39;s so that&#39;s like the best
like takeaway from that is like I don&#39;t
think you have to yell ever to get your
point across and like yeah or like
insulting people like looks I think
always that too you like lose right
away. So I always that&#39;s what I&#39;ve
learned. I did both very often. So I
think people didn&#39;t take me seriously
cuz I was just like so loud and just so
angry and I would come for like their
looks or whatever. You know what I mean?
And it&#39;s like
and it&#39;s like you&#39;re right. You&#39;re so
right about that. being calmer. And a
lot of times when dealing with like
narcissists, not that I&#39;m calling anyone
that we&#39;ve just talked about, just in
general, I&#39;m saying like people that&#39;s
what they want is to get that rise out
of you and then you&#39;ve automatically
lost by like giving them that as well.
Like I think it&#39;s so important to just
stay calm, cool, and collected. Even
now, I mean, I rarely rarely get
triggered that capacity. But like
earlier this year, someone like kind of
triggered me a little bit and I wanted
to talk about it, but I had to like I
had to like cuss like cuss and scream
like before I did talked about it cuz I
was like, &#34;Let me just tell Mo cuz I was
so pissed.&#34; I was like, &#34;This is such a
lie. This is so annoying. Why would they
pin me like this?&#34; Whatever. And then
when you can like calmly talk about it,
it makes so much better.
100%. Like we always talk about like the
stopping and thinking, even like that
Todd thing, like you know what I mean?
not impulsively doing things out of
emotion and being reactionary. It&#39;s like
it&#39;s a 10ear battle for me, you know.
And you do so good cuz so many people
like will talk about you and you&#39;ll be
like, &#34;Oh, that wasn&#39;t right or that&#39;s
not what I meant.&#34; And you you do well
at like letting things go for the most
part, you know, whatever is like not
important, but you know, like the Todd
thing obviously bothered you. But I do
think there&#39;s like
Yeah, I&#39;m starting to learn like cuz I
think even like after all of that like
Alyssa Violet and that like the Cody Co
like all of that drama on canceled I
almost became this person who was like
scared to start clarifying things
because I realized that your words hold
power and like sometimes you can&#39;t give
anything power and now I&#39;m kind of
getting back into it like where it&#39;s
like no sometimes you can&#39;t even with
like that canceled AdSense thing I was
like no I&#39;m going to make a TikTok about
it like I want to you know what I mean
like it&#39;s sometimes even yesterday like
I just saw I was getting so dragged into
Brooke and BB&#39;s everything and I was
like this it&#39;s not my this has nothing
to do with me. You know what I mean?
Like it&#39;s like sometimes standing up for
yourself and just being like
for sure. Or I think when you re you did
a TikTok about the canceled AdSense
thing like also just like you know you
you put something out there and you like
the way it&#39;s perceived you&#39;re like oh
like you could see how something was
perceived and then you&#39;re like oh well
let me acknowledge that like I see this.
You know what I mean? I see what you
guys are saying. Cuz that&#39;s me too. So
many times I say stuff and then like
when people give me feedback I&#39;m like oh
that makes sense. And so I always try to
be like
100% I see what you&#39;re saying. And I
think that&#39;s like the learning and
growing of it all is like seeing what
people say and just being like, &#34;Oh
yeah, I see.&#34;
And understanding how you could have
like played a part. Like I realized that
me just like throwing those words out
there so flippantly is my word of the
month, but so flippantly like was like
that&#39;s on me. Of course, if you&#39;re going
to say something like that like that,
people are going to react that way and
you should give more context. It is the
the the curse of the podcast is when you
just talk so much all the time you&#39;re
bound to say something that comes across
not the way you intended
and you get so comfortable like even
sometimes here I will genuinely like
like it&#39;s so wild cuz right now I&#39;m
looking at one two three cameras
1 2 3 four giant lights but for some
reason like I&#39;ll just like be looking at
you and like be like it&#39;s just me and
Trisha talking
and same with Brooke like I&#39;ll just and
then I&#39;ll just I&#39;m the type of person
too off camera very much where I just
speak my consciousness That part is hard
cuz you are very that and then like it&#39;s
like okay are we talking about this or
are we not talking about it? You know
what I mean?
Yes. Yeah.
And it&#39;s like oh my Mako is so good with
that too. He like really thinks before
he speaks like I&#39;ll watch him and I&#39;m
like how the do you know the talent like
he&#39;ll like and he&#39;ll really take like
that 15-second pause and sometimes I&#39;m
like spit it out but it&#39;s like
you need it.
No, he&#39;s eating. He&#39;s not going to say
some that he doesn&#39;t mean you know and
it&#39;s like oh my god I&#39;m just learning to
become that person. I realize I&#39;ll never
be that person, but I need to for sure.
Yeah, but but we have an editing, you
know, we have an editor, so like if
there is something
That&#39;s true.
I just hate in the moment when we ever
film something like edit.
Yes. It&#39;s a fine line, too, because I&#39;ve
there have been times in my life where
you come on camera and you&#39;re like being
so calculated and you&#39;re thinking about
what everyone&#39;s going to say or you&#39;re
when I was reading Reddit, good god, I
was like everything I said, I was like
trying to
be this perfect person. You know what I
And it&#39;s like that doesn&#39;t make for good
content either. Like authenticity that&#39;s
always how I&#39;ve been. Like I&#39;m just not
I don&#39;t have to turn on and become
someone else. Like who you see online is
who I am. And like
you know I don&#39;t know.
No, you&#39;re very much that. You&#39;re very
much how you are. And you are in your
piece era offline as you are online too.
Trying screaming.
Hell begging like just you know really
trying. But thanks to you too so much.
You really like
usher me into that and hold me down you
I love I do love this era for you. I
love this era for us cuz it is crazy. We
were talking about how like collabing is
like so can be like so stressful or so
like but it&#39;s like so easy, so chill,
so amazing.
It&#39;s just like I love it so much. I&#39;m
glad you&#39;re still doing it cuz I know
you&#39;re like so busy and you&#39;re going to
Maui and I&#39;m just like oh I love that
we&#39;re still doing this.
No, forever doing this. And the other
day I was really thinking about one of
the things that I&#39;m very grateful for in
our friendship is just I don&#39;t know how
to explain the way you hype me up like
it&#39;ll be the littlest thing like you
know what I mean? and it&#39;ll be like a
top I wore or like a bracelet I&#39;m
wearing or like even just like something
I was thinking about or like something I
don&#39;t know how to explain it. Like you
just like really pay attention and
you&#39;re like just such a like hype woman.
You make me feel like so comfortable
with who I am and like loved for who I
exactly am which
I just really appreciate.
Oh I well I definitely like see you.
It&#39;s so funny. I just like it is like
having like a little sister or a little
me or something like that. You know what
I It&#39;s like little you
and you are such a like a light like and
little me but I&#39;m like obviously way
more successful and way more I don&#39;t
want to do anything like okay comparing
herself to Tana like no we&#39;re twins I&#39;m
but even like Malibu like when she comes
to you like there is like a light where
like kids are like you know they&#39;re
either a little standoffish or they&#39;re
like really and Malibu like comes to you
know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a little light
and you are this like light you&#39;re like
a genuinely nice person I say that about
you whereas me I feel like I&#39;ve always I
don&#39;t know I had to like unlearn some
mean girl tendencies but you&#39;re just
always been genuine and sweet in me and
like yeah know and you&#39;re like
you&#39;re the ultimate hype woman and
friend and it&#39;s just like crazy it is
like literally it will be something so
stupid like I&#39;ll not wear a lash and
you&#39;ll be like I love your natural
lashes and everyone did on the comments
on the last one they&#39;re like they did
all the comments were like Tana I love
this look you look so fresh there was a
day where you said you were like not
wearing any makeup or you were like
really quick on doing makeup like no she
looks so good
I read the you should read the comments
on here they&#39;re really really sweet and
then I always see all the things I
missing say like
I don&#39;t know if I talked about this, but
me dad being like, &#34;Amari has never been
Malibu Barbie for Halloween.&#34; And
everyone was like,
and people are like, &#34;Oh, yeah, he
definitely
has definitely has.&#34;
Well, that&#39;s a memory, I think. And my
memory is just the worst. I am like that
all the time.
My misspeak so definitively. Like I&#39;m
like, &#34;Never has and I know it.&#34; It&#39;s
but that&#39;s because you&#39;re just Yeah,
you&#39;re I&#39;m the same way. Last week I
think Oscar&#39;s like, &#34;You definitely
dress like Wednesday.&#34; Adam&#39;s like,
&#34;Never. I&#39;ve never dressed like her.&#34;
And then literally like an ASMR of me
just like impersonating her fully with a
braid. And I was like, &#34;What?&#34;
Because we do so much. Like you and I,
we move so fast and we&#39;re always like,
&#34;How can you remember everything?&#34; You
know, just impossible at all.
You never responded to my Halloween
costume. I sent you of us.
I was like, &#34;Oh,
because that&#39;s so funny. Oh my god.&#34;
Because I literally like I responded in
my head. I promise you that much.
I was like, &#34;This is eat.&#34; And then
you&#39;re like, &#34;Nothing.&#34;
I I don&#39;t respond to half text either,
but I was like, I thought that one was
kind of good, actually.
No, I I promise you that I I am so sorry
I didn&#39;t respond because I look at what
Trisha said, Omar, you&#39;re going to die.
She goes, cuz like we were talking about
potentially being the substance, but I
think that we should be the substance in
the regard that we are both sfxed,
crazy, like bad, and then we we both
have like a pros, like a Barbie or like
a prosthetic type of thing coming out of
our back. Like, do you get what I&#39;m
Like we both are the gremlins and we
both have the like
No, but we&#39;re people. There should be a
gremlin and a young hot. Like that&#39;s the
whole point.
She said we should be this.
I think that&#39;d be so cute. I love it.
And I&#39;m sitting next to
you so up. Like I get what you&#39;re
saying. It&#39;s really good. But we&#39;re a
duo. We have to do a duo costume. We
can&#39;t just like It&#39;s like both of us
being Barbie. It&#39;s like that&#39;s not a duo
costume. Like we&#39;re a duo costume.
I get you&#39;re like you&#39;re right. Like you
are right. But something about that
but she wants to match.
Well, I just think that there&#39;s
something derogatory about Trisha being
like the gremlin and me being like he
But that is us. You are the younger
version. We just said it. You&#39;re like a
younger version.
But like I&#39;m also like I need like Alex
coming out of my back, you know? Like I
don&#39;t necessarily think that like I am
like like the Russian doll 21 and like
you know it&#39;s just like and there&#39;s
something that feels so derogatory about
it&#39;s not especially I&#39;m the one that&#39;s
like oh we should cuz you said it and I
haven&#39;t seen the substance so I&#39;m like
googling I&#39;m like trying to find the
substance costumes I&#39;m like oh this one
this one is it this is everything you
come out aerobics outfit cuz I saw
Margaret Qualie has aerobics aerobics
and she&#39;s
one hair coming out of her
the saggy boobs I saw one where she had
like really saggy boobs I about that
everything. Like I love it. I love
I get what you&#39;re saying. I think I
agree with you. Like it&#39;s iconic as but
there&#39;s something about me that feels
some type of way.
We&#39;re doing it
because you&#39;re so hot. Like that&#39;s
crazy. And I know you&#39;re always down to
be the like
not and so am I. You know what I mean?
Like I I think that that is kind of
I think it&#39;s funny especially like the
older again being older and also just
being like not in my hot era by choice.
I&#39;m trying to put my hip back into
Are you okay? What happened?
No, I put it back in. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m
just 80.
Are you sure?
Yes. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. I need to
be equivalent to Pilates. Someone said
Pilates fixes it.
My hips.
we have to.
Oh, today today I went to go tour like a
little Pilates gym and the girl was
like, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m a dancer and I hurt my
hip.&#34; That&#39;s what she was saying. She I
hurt my hip. So, Pilates has like healed
her hip and I was like, &#34;Oh my god, I
thought of you instantly.&#34;
Oh my god.
But I still have the time to do it. I
want to join it. It&#39;s like $250 a month,
but I&#39;m like I want to go. I I need to
go. I need to put it first. But it&#39;s
you want to do this and I think you have
to, but also how do how do you find
Are you doing it with strangers? That&#39;s
what I want to know.
No. Well, this one&#39;s not, but I I can&#39;t
only because like I would feel so
self-conscious. I mean, this is in a gym
and I already felt self-conscious going
into the gym. I saw like Oh, I saw like
Lauren Gay there and which I love. She
was so sweet. She&#39;s like, if you ever
need a gym partner, but she looked so
Yeah. And it&#39;s like I I feel the same
Alo, okay, she looks so hot. Everyone
looks so hot there. I was already
intimidated. So, I&#39;m like, I definitely
need to do a private cuz
even like I always want to be like,
Brooke, should I come to Aloe? But it&#39;s
like I&#39;m not asking that. I don&#39;t want
to do that. I can&#39;t start.
I would love to see you at Aloe.
No. Yeah. Maybe if I got good I would go
as a good like but I&#39;m not trying there.
Did he do Pilates there?
Like and even Jake Shane is so like real
and funny for posting him like shaking
on the reformer before he got there.
He I don&#39;t know. I think so. Yeah.
Before he like got and now he&#39;s good and
he kills it. I&#39;m just like I would have
to be alone with an instructor until I
was confident that I wouldn&#39;t like get
hurt in front of like
everybody.
Haley Bieber.
Like I&#39;m not going to the Alo gym. The
gym&#39;s an elevated like really scary.
Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s definitely like I&#39;d
have to practice. I need to lose like
some weight and then I&#39;ll go there. But
yeah, it&#39;s just like and it is like I
get that it&#39;s Brooke will even just like
the people that like she&#39;s seeing and
telling me and whatever, but she&#39;s good
at that. So she feels comfortable in the
environment
like and which I think is so iconic. I
really do. But like I&#39;m I need to be
solo with an instructor.
Or like doing it with a friend who&#39;s
also beginning like us doing it together
would be fun cuz it&#39;s like we&#39;d be able
to laugh at ourselves.
I know. I really want to do it. When can
you but you can&#39;t do I&#39;m trying to do
mornings. I guess I could do afternoons.
When when would you do it ideally like
your time?
We should do one and then try to come
here and like do not love line and talk
about it.
There is like one down the street. Maybe
I should just join it. Maybe I should
just be like let&#39;s join it cuz then you
could just come for like the morning and
Why don&#39;t we see if they let us do one
class? Like let&#39;s cuz what if we hate
I Right.
They should let you do that. Do they let
you do that? That is actually a good
point cuz you have to stay for like a
year and I&#39;m like wait. And it&#39;s so
funny. Like gym memberships in LA, even
Equinox, like it&#39;s like you have to move
away or be injured to like get out of
it. It&#39;s like come on.
Oh, really?
And prove it.
Wait, what do you mean? You can&#39;t
I have like nine broken legs
and I&#39;ve moved to Florida twice.
That&#39;s so scary. You can&#39;t just cancel.
You have to move away.
It&#39;s cold.
That&#39;s a call.
Well, a lot of Yeah, a lot of gyms are
like that. I get it. Like they want to
lock you in for the membership.
I get it. You should be able to cancel
like after a year. It&#39;s like, what if
this just isn&#39;t my vibe?
There&#39;s no way it&#39;s in my vibe category.
Oh, that does scare me. I guess that
part kind of scares me, too. Membership
and I just be, oh my god, that that&#39;s
happened to me so many times with
Equinox where I&#39;ve like I&#39;m paying $300
a month and then I&#39;m like, oh my god, I
don&#39;t even go anymore. I don&#39;t even
And you have to keep going.
Yeah, you say you&#39;re injured.
I used to love it, but it is like very
wild. It&#39;s $300 a month. It&#39;s like a
little nicer, but you also like I see
everyone I know and like the only perk
is like K&#39;s skincare in the bathroom and
like a cold peppermint towel,
but like 300 I&#39;ll go to Kes and just
ball out. Like I also have a gym in my
house. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m like
Yeah, we do too. But I I just don&#39;t feel
motivated to go in my house. I have to
like go somewhere. I feel to like have a
I saw Well, Ashley actually has been
reading this book and I forget what the
book is. It&#39;s called like hack your
habits or something. It&#39;s a pop. I don&#39;t
know if that&#39;s what it&#39;s called. me is
spreading misinformation. Um,
it sounds like a good name,
but she was telling me about it, right?
And one of the theories that this guy
who wrote this book had, it&#39;s a popular
self-help book is called the 2-minute
theory. And it&#39;s like if you want to
instill a habit in your life, you do it
for 2 minutes a day. Like if it&#39;s if you
want to start working out, you put on
your running shoes and you like go to
your treadmill and you walk for 2
minutes. And even if you want to do it
longer, you have to stop. Like you only
do the 2 minutes and you do this for 21
days cuz that&#39;s how long it takes to
form a habit.
And then by the 21st day, a this will be
a part of your routine and you&#39;ll be
mentally in the habit of putting your
shoes on and going to the treadmill, but
also because you&#39;ve been stopping
yourself, you&#39;ll want to do it for
Oh, so then after the 21 days, you can
start doing for as long as you want.
Yes. Weird. I was I don&#39;t I feel like
that would work on my like ADHD walnut
It would definitely work, but I still
think it would work if you do go 15
minutes or 20 minutes if you want.
That&#39;s true. But then are you getting
like overwhelmed and you don&#39;t want to
do it the next day? Like it&#39;s just about
enforcing.
I see. That makes sense. What else would
you do for 2 minutes?
I&#39;m about to start doing that with my
book too where I just like work for a
couple minutes instead.
You stop after 2 minutes. That&#39;s wild.
I know. It&#39;s It&#39;s like it&#39;ll work for
the book.
I mean, it sounds like it could work. I
cuz I get in my head about the book,
too, where I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh my god, I have
to enter this dark head space or I have
to like you know what I mean?&#34; Like
Yeah. Do you have someone that like has
helping you with your thoughts and
stories and
or you just doing it yourself?
I have someone who is going to help me
but like I am really like because I
think it&#39;s like I really like I&#39;m like
10 chapters deep and I&#39;m like I like
what I have
by yourself.
That is so impressive.
I am like just and I am like I&#39;m
confident in it. You know what I mean?
So I&#39;m like
And maybe it&#39;s an ego thing. Maybe it&#39;s
like I I even like I&#39;ll sit there and
like wait to find a good analogy in
writing versus like I don&#39;t want someone
to make my analogies for me. I don&#39;t
want someone to like you know like I
You are that person with songwriting too
when we&#39;re talking about writing songs
like you want to be in there. That call
we had last week you&#39;re I need to be in
the writing room like you actually like
do love to that now that I&#39;m like think
about that. That&#39;s
I love to write. I&#39;m passionate. So
pass. So this and this is like the
climax of that. You know what I mean?
It&#39;s like the I don&#39;t know. I just cuz
even like I&#39;ll be writing and I&#39;ll be
like what the like I&#39;ll be say like
typing things. so in the way I would say
it that like I don&#39;t think someone else
could like get in my up brain.
Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s the hard part is
trying to see your voice. Oh my god,
that&#39;s actually so impressive. Yeah,
you&#39;re so good. We did like a the first
time ever I think we did like a business
call together and I was like like all of
us on and I was like so impressed. You
were like asking questions like they say
the number one thing in like an
interview or like yeah like a business
meeting is like ask questions and I&#39;m
always the person like do you have any
questions? I&#39;m like nope. Like you know
and you had so many good ones. I was
like, damn.
Just cuz especially like with business
ventures now, I feel like I&#39;ve that
comes with like having gone through the
ringer in so many aspects, whether it&#39;s
like contractually or like signing up
for something thinking it&#39;s one thing
and then it&#39;s something else and you&#39;re
like now I like I want to know
everything.
You&#39;re so smart. You&#39;re so smart. You
were so intelligent. Yeah, I was I was
the f up on that call. Everyone was so

don&#39;t want to see my face on this Zoom,
you know what I mean?
And people add their little backgrounds.
I don&#39;t even know how to do that.

I need to learn how to do that. I always
have in the background of my Zoom calls.
Yes, me too. I know. I I take them in
different places, too, and it&#39;s always
looking terrible behind me. I have to
learn how to fuzz it or blur it or
whatever I do. I don&#39;t have to do it.
Zoom is I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like Zoom. I
like I have to do it all the time. But

Hey, Trish. Hey, Tana. I just took a
pregnancy test this morning and it was
positive. And I was looking in my
closet. I&#39;ve been really big into
manifestation and the Lion&#39;s Portal just
passed. If you know, you know. And I
just had to call to share with you that
I had bought a lemon onesie years ago.
And Trisha, you posted Malibu as a baby
in the onesie
and I was struggling at the time because
I wasn&#39;t getting pregnant. And I&#39;m
looking at that onesie right now in my
closet and I just know everything
everything works out the way that it&#39;s
supposed to. And although I don&#39;t have
real life girlfriends, Trish and Tana
really have been two influences in my
life that I just look to for a laugh and
a giggle and you make my life better.
And I just wanted to share my positive
news with you because I don&#39;t have
really anybody to share it with. I&#39;m
waiting for my boyfriend to get off work
and surprise him.
Thank you girls for being you. I love
you so much. Bye.

thing of manifestation and I&#39;m so I&#39;m so
happy for you.
I am so happy for you, too. And that&#39;s
so cool that you&#39;re building your own
little best friend right now, too. And

time. First pregnancy and that early
pregnancy and getting excited and it&#39;s
it is like the best. Like I wish I could
be pregnant for the first time again.

so fun. Especially when you wanted it
for so long and you said you&#39;re waiting
for your boyfriend to come home and
surprise him. Like that&#39;s just like
and the fact that she called us. Like
I know that&#39;s that we&#39;re like the first
to know because she didn&#39;t tell her
boyfriend. Like that&#39;s
and the little lemon onesie the
manifestation that&#39;s so real. And like
it&#39;s so crazy too all of the things that
