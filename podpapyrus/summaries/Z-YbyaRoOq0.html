<li>Joel Lawler grew up in Charlestown, Boston - a tight-knit Irish Catholic neighborhood with a reputation for bank robberies and organized crime</li>
<li>Despite coming from a loving family with "citizen" parents, he felt ashamed of having more than his friends and wanted to fit in with those from broken homes</li>
<li>The neighborhood culture taught "what goes on here stays here" - no snitching was instilled in families, not just learned on streets</li>
<li>He progressed rapidly from drinking with older kids at 15 to drug dealing to bank robberies, following the established criminal hierarchy</li>
<li>At 21, he was sentenced to 111 months (9+ years) in federal prison for interstate drug trafficking and firearm charges after crossing state lines</li>
<li>His federal prison number (748) identified him as organized crime, placing him with actual mob figures and earning immediate respect</li>
<li>Federal prison had different "clientele" than state - less frequent violence but more serious when it occurred, with established hierarchies</li>
<li>Boston had an outstanding reputation in federal prison, with older inmates taking him under their wing and teaching him how to carry himself</li>
<li>Coming home at 30 with no life skills was harder than prison itself - he survived prison but didn't know how to actually live</li>
<li>He struggled with identity issues, having created a character based on neighborhood reputation rather than developing his authentic self</li>
<li>The "Lace Up" podcast represents turning pain into purpose - helping others navigate adversity and telling authentic stories</li>
<li>Real gangster behavior means showing up for family, learning from mistakes, and helping others - not the Hollywood portrayal</li>
<li>Prison taught survival skills but not life skills - the real challenge was learning how to live, not just survive</li>
<li>Speaking your truth attracts the right people and opportunities - authenticity over performance or validation-seeking</li>
<li>Everyone goes through adversity - the key is bouncing back and using experiences to help others in similar situations</li>
<li>The neighborhood's reputation was both a blessing and curse - provided protection and respect but also trapped people in destructive patterns</li>
<li>Federal prison politics were less volatile than state prison but required strict adherence to unwritten rules and hierarchies</li>
<li>Coming from the streets prepared him for prison survival but left him unprepared for legitimate life upon release</li>

What&#39;s up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of EOS. It&#39;s 1090 Jake.
I&#39;m rocking with y&#39;all. Y&#39;all rocking
with me. This video. Got another
interview for y&#39;all. Special guest. Go
ahead and introduce yourself.
Hey guys, my name is Joel Lawler. I&#39;m
from Boston, a neighborhood of Boston
called Charles Town. And uh I&#39;m blessed
and grateful for the opportunity. Thanks
for having me, my friend.
Definitely. It&#39;s good to meet you.
Yeah, absolutely, man.
Now, I am very familiar with Charles
Yep. Yep. But I want to hear your story
starting from the very beginning. What
was it like growing up there?
Growing up in Charles Town was was
different, you know. It was something
that I I would never change, you know. I
certainly wouldn&#39;t change it. It has um
Charleston has a reputation, you know,
but I think from what I&#39;ve learned as
I&#39;ve gotten older is that, you know, a
lot of people hang on to um that that
reputation, you know, for all the wrong
reasons. And um you know, myself
included, you know, and there&#39;s a lot of
for as much pride as there is in in a
neighborhood like Charles Town, South
Boston, you know, different
neighborhoods there. What I&#39;ve learned
along the way is that that pride
ultimately was um you know underlying
stuff like you know fears, insecurities
and uh you know all all um you know
camouflaged and covered up or whatever
to protect like you know um you know to
protect people you know ultimately at
the end of the day you know so it was
like survival mode. So
well you know that&#39;s what I&#39;ve gotten
out of it.
I feel like nationwide you know one of
my favorite movies if not my favorite is
the town.
Yep. And you know, it&#39;s the the bank
robberies, the amid truck robberies.
Charles Town&#39;s known as a a tough place,
but it&#39;s also it&#39;s really a white hood.
Which in other places, they&#39;ve never
heard of. You know, Charles Town has
white projects.
Absolutely.
You know what I mean? So,
it certainly does.
Tell me how it is coming from a place
like that. like when at what point did
you know or start to realize you lived
in a place that was different from other
areas of Boston and Massachusetts?
Well, it&#39;s funny you should ask that. To
be honest with you, I I didn&#39;t know, you
know, I I grew up there. You know, what
I knew I I knew. I knew that um there
was a tight-knit community. I knew that
there was, you know, love there. I knew
that I was, you know, protected or
whatever. I was secure. Um,
and but I also, you know, I didn&#39;t
really compare or, you know, there was
no, you know, poverty or or, you know,
wasn&#39;t like rich or poor, whatever.
Everyone was everyone was kind of equal
or whatever. It was either I guess like
the first time I I really ever thought
about it was maybe like as I entered my
teenage years and um you know my parents
like they they they started out like a
in the bricks and then to a house in
development you know which is like
projects without the bricks and then
eventually you know they they got a
house and I was I was I was young and um
you know I remember growing up and
having a house and a lot of my friends
you know had the single you know had
maybe a mom no dad and came from those
broken homes and they lived in the
projects and when I when I remember
feeling that feeling of um almost like I
felt ashamed that I had something that
they didn&#39;t have, you know, and
ultimately
when I look back I know what that was,
you know, I didn&#39;t want them to feel
less than. And in turn I ended up um you
know I caused myself a lot of harm along
the way because um you know I settle for
less and like you know I just kind of
wanted to fit in and like where I wanted
to fit in and where I ended up
ultimately you know being accepted was
by those you know people that were in
situations that they if they had known
any better or maybe they learned along
the way you know couldn&#39;t wait to get
out of you know. So, even though you
felt more fortunate, you felt more
comfortable with the unfortunate.
Oh, 100%. I&#39;m a I&#39;m a I&#39;m a I&#39;m
hot-headed like a tough learner, you
know, and I&#39;ll get it, but like I&#39;m I&#39;m
going to have to bang my head along the
way, you know. I&#39;m going to have to
Pain&#39;s a great motivator and I certainly
suffered my share of that,
you know, and um like you said, yeah, I
felt comfortable. Well, I got in where I
could fit in and like ultimately where I
fit in was I almost felt like I was
doing better. So, right off the rip, I
was comparing, you know, I wasn&#39;t
identifying anything within myself, you
know, I was I was running. and I was
escaping just like every other kid, you
know, and that goes for anywhere, but in
a neighborhood like that, like I said,
the problem with that is the
misinformation that was that,
you know, I carried and every other kid
did cuz we certainly weren&#39;t down the
corner talking about uh you weren&#39;t
talking about what was going on in your
house, right? Cuz what goes on here
stays here, right?
That was never elaborated on. And you
certainly weren&#39;t saying if you were
having a bad day or whatever, you know,
you kind of just wore that you arm it up
and and you kept it moving and uh thank
God for mental health like you know like
how it&#39;s come along the way and that
there&#39;s you know there&#39;s help for and
there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s things out there
now you know um but as far as doing it
that&#39;s a whole another ball game, you
know. So but yeah, and you talked about
Charles Town being like um an Irish
ghetto, right? So, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read
the book The Westies, you know, uh,
Hell&#39;s Kitchen, New York.
I haven&#39;t.
No. Oh, you you got to read that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Um, so like I said, New York has the
burrows, you know, the Bronx, Brooklyn,
all that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] And Boston has the
neighborhoods as you know,
right? So,
well, explain it for the people that
don&#39;t know the neighborhood breakdown of
Boston. So obviously it&#39;s 2025, you
know, things have you been gentrified
and also there are people, you know,
that maybe live in a in a high-rise that
that, you know, non-stop a high-rise
today that
you know are in plants and and and live
in the city because they work there. But
when you know growing up it was all
neighborhoods. You know you went to
Boston like maybe people work there and
stuff or as kids we take the bus in and
stuff and that would be we make a day of
it but ultimately it was all
neighborhoods. So you had my
neighborhood um was Irish Catholic
neighborhood. South Boston the same
thing and it was just basically a
smaller version of South Boston.
So you have South Boston right is you
hear Boston&#39;s in the word right right
then and there. And Charles Town, you
know, it says Charles Town, Mass, but
it&#39;s a neighborhood of Boston, right? So
Boston&#39;s made up basically my
neighborhood, my town is um was too
small to be its own city because you go
across the bridge and you have Cambridge
and it&#39;s basically it&#39;s it&#39;s right
there. It&#39;s connected, but it&#39;s big
enough where it&#39;s its own city. So
Cambridge and Charleston are right right
next to each other, but one&#39;s known for
like MIT and and for smarts or Goodwill
Hunting, you know what I mean? The
janitor that uh you know, the
mathematician and Charleston now is
predominantly, you know, it was it was
were known for um a lot of, you know,
you know, a lot of the wrong things,
like I said, but that didn&#39;t stop me
from uh following suit, you know, and
and and once, you know, hitting that
corner as a teenager and saying like
what do I got to do, you know, like
where do I sign up? And like I say, like
I checked all the boxes, you know, of
this resume that like I created in my
When you first stepped into the street,
what was some of the things that were
going on? Was there any neighborhood
rivalries between Charles Town and
Salty? Was it kids in Charles Town you
were beefing with? Was it drugs? Like
what was your introduction to the
So my introduction to the streets was
like I said,
you know, we went from sports to courts,
right? We wanted to be Cam Ney. We
wanted to be Ray Bourke. We wanted to,
you know, we wanted to be um Larry Bird
or whatever. And then um you know
overnight almost it it was like once you
hit once I hit that corner you know I I
say all the time my mother could have
been Mother Teresa my father could have
been the pope and once I hit the corner
I was going to be whatever I thought
you&#39;d accept me as. And I say that for
myself like I I I I love that saying
because I think it sums up in a lot of
ways like and it&#39;s something that I need
to hear. But that right there when I s
when I was able to say that and like and
speak my truth,
it was something something that went off
inside me where there&#39;s something to be
said about it like it made me it
fulfilled me like it almost filled my
tank where you know that that hole in
your soul that void or something that
you maybe um lacking or and when I
started talking like that but I had to
learn like I said I had to go through a
lot of um a lot of pain a lot of
struggle a lot of self-inflicted and it
was Because like I said that, you know,
what goes on in this house stays in this
house and like you just put on that
brave face and like at the end of the
day I&#39;m a human being, right? I can&#39;t
disassociate, right? That&#39;s the
difference between like a sociopath or
like, you know, a narcissist or someone
that can like do that, right? I&#39;ve ran
with people that are that suffer from
that. You know what I mean? I&#39;m not
going to sit here and diagnose them. But
I don&#39;t have that luxury. I can&#39;t flick,
you know, flip a switch and I fail
everything. So in turn, like hitting
that corner, what I know now is that I
was running like right from the rip, you
know, I was I was I was trying to escape
myself really at the end of the day. And
I think that it it held true for a lot
of a lot of the kids in my neighborhood,
you know, most of them because we came
from the we were cut from the same
cloth. We came from the same type of uh
backgrounds and families. And that&#39;s not
just Shelson, that goes like throughout
the city, you know. So those teenage
years which are obviously very
impressionable
um you know I don&#39;t think most people
are born leaders you know and I&#39;m fine
with just uh at the end of the day it&#39;s
like all right so I&#39;m fine with just
like I just want to be you know just I
want to be part of right I want to I
want to be one of the boys right and the
misinformation that we were given you
know not by malice or or spite was just
generation after generation that was
like that trickled down and that was
passed down. And I came from a house
where like I had my parents like I say
like they were citizens. They weren&#39;t
you know they didn&#39;t come from criminal
activity and stuff like that but they
were knockound people. And what that
means is like, you know, when the when
the truck came through or the when the
trailers came came through, you know,
down S square or something and you know,
next thing you know, there&#39;s um, you
know, new Nikes or a new jumpsuit or it
didn&#39;t matter what it was, right? Like
you hit the corner and every kid down
there, right? It didn&#39;t matter if their
if their mother or father was um, you
know, into into illegal activity or
anything. Like even the the knockaround
people, those like the the straight lace
people and the people that like went to
work every day and and taught their
their children, you know, morals,
values, and principles, you know, that
that kid was rocking the rocking rocking
the same things, the same, you know what
I mean? The same Nikes. And so, you
know, you think about the things that um
kind of shape you or whatnot. So, you
know, and then like when we&#39;re left to
figure it out on our own, um
this like this head for sure was
certainly unreliable, you know. So, but
yeah, so that&#39;s um yeah, Charleston was
a a different place. I wouldn&#39;t change
it, but it it certainly led to maybe my
maybe my story would have manifested in
a different way or whatever. Maybe I
would have suffered in a different way.
And I believe that&#39;s that that may be
true, but I hardly I I seriously doubt
that I would have engaged in the
criminal activity that I did. Uh jumped
right in. You know, I was all in and
that wasn&#39;t how I was raised. And you
know, maybe I don&#39;t go to prison and
spend my 20s in prison and and you know,
the time that I&#39;ll never get back. But
um what I learned today is like you know
when I wasn&#39;t willing to face that or
look at that and kind of accept like
what had happened to me or whatever or
like how how my story unfolded like I
was stuck and because I held on to a
resentment that like if I grew up in
Welssley or like one of these one of
these towns that um I wouldn&#39;t have went
through what I went through and I think
we both know that that&#39;s not true. You
I kind of So for what it&#39;s worth
I wouldn&#39;t change it. You know, maybe
back then I would have had a different a
different story or whatnot, but you
know, we come out the other side and you
know, you&#39;re a testament to it yourself.
What was the first or when was the first
time you were arrested?
The first time I was arrested, my you
know, they talk about like progression
and how things like
they progress so so quickly where, you
know, coming from that house, you know,
with that that unconditional love,
right? And but to me like what like I
said about the comparison right like you
know they talk about compare you know
you know identify don&#39;t compare. So when
I went down the corner and I feel like
maybe every I&#39;ll speak for myself but
I&#39;m sure every kid was doing the same
thing right it gave me comfort. It kind
of it made me feel okay basically I
would say to to look and see like all
right this kid has it worse. Right. So
you talked about where I felt
comfortable, right? I felt comfortable
when I thought that you didn&#39;t have what
I have, right? But like I couldn&#39;t be
even proud of what I you know what I was
given and like what my parents had um
you know provided for me because I was
so worried about like I didn&#39;t want to
make you feel bad or I didn&#39;t want you
know I didn&#39;t want to like put the
mirror in your face you know and
in turn what that does you know it
created like just a a scenario where it
was just a big facade and there was a
lot of lies and a lot of misinformation
and like you know the same people that
were taught like that the morals,
values, and pride that like we&#39;re in the
sandbox and our mothers told us like,
you know, you don&#39;t tattle on people and
stuff like that. Like I say, I didn&#39;t
have to go down the street corner to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] know not to tell on someone. You
know what I&#39;m saying?
That that was a that was like a
neighborhood like that was a instilled
in the families.
Yeah. I learned Yeah. We learned that
at, you know, at home and
um so maybe with that being said, I
think that that speak for that speaks
for itself, too. like where else that&#39;s
not that&#39;s probably a little abnormal,
but um it kind of you know I think that
it it it got us prepared already for for
situations in life that like a lot of
people I don&#39;t think could would be able
to survive you know um and I wouldn&#39;t
wish on anyone to be honest with you and
you know so that that tight-knit
community that pride um you know there&#39;s
a fine line between like the pride and
like you know ego and stuff you know
where you know there&#39;s a lot of they
there&#39;s a saying that says like
egoomaniac with inferiority complex and
that couldn&#39;t hold more true where it
was like when I needed to I had no
substance right so when I went down that
corner right and I can&#39;t and I was a
good kid right and and so so to speak
and you know he comes from a good family
right well that&#39;s all irrelevant I had
good intentions that was all irrelevant
I didn&#39;t know that I hung on to that for
a long time that was my identity But I
never formed my own ident you know my
own identity.
My identity was formed by what like my
environment and how
and how it was perceived right and the
perception of that looked like
if I what do I have to do to be one of
the boys? What do I have to do to get
this recognition? And for someone like
me, right, that scared kid that went
down the corner. And I like, you know,
your story when you talk about it when
you hit the prison system and stuff and
being in the environments that you were
in. Um,
I&#39;m so it&#39;s like that fear and that&#39;s
what I like to like speak of now and
like because it&#39;s so profound to me is
like I was so uncomfortable with my own
skin, right? That I was willing to like
be a chameleon. I was willing to do
whatever it took to like let you know
I&#39;m not scared, right? You know, I&#39;m not
scared. But what that looked like was a
lot of like you know self like
inflicting pain and like things that you
know I guess we&#39;re lucky to even be here
to be you know and having this
conversation because a lot of uh you
know family friends acquaintances they
didn&#39;t they weren&#39;t that fortunate. So
I like to believe that you know at the
end of the day like
and that&#39;s like what it keeps me humble
and humility where and I see it in you.
It&#39;s like at the end of the day it&#39;s
like all right well if someone can learn
from my experience you know I&#39;m a fir I
kind of believe that people have to go
through their own stuff you know you
know I have a 21-y old my son like I&#39;ve
t you know he he&#39;s going he&#39;s on his own
journey right now and that&#39;s tough you
know it&#39;s tough because growing up it
was like our caretakers like our parents
like we had you know I always say the
good people where we&#39;re from are the
salt of the earth you know no one can
tell me different right but it&#39;s also
like a jackal and hide thing where it
it&#39;s it comes down to like the person
and like their identity and everyone was
like so codependent, right? You had the
mothers that like took care and like
they would, you know, I joke around like
40 46 years old, my mother would still
wipe my ass if I let her, you know what
I mean? And like that&#39;s that&#39;s it. We we
we make light of things where it was
always whatever made you feel
comfortable and like and everyone
assumed that role. Everyone took that
role on and they did it to like the best
of their ability. that don&#39;t always look
pretty, you know, and that&#39;s not always
the right way. So,
going down to that corner obviously is a
phrase, right? What was it that you were
actually participating in and at what
point what was it that led to your first
arrest? So, the first when I hit the
corner, like I said, you know, it
started with
maybe I think it started with like
finding a a dirty pack, you know, of uh
Bud Light, you know, the older kids had
hidden in an alleyway and going up the
back of the park, you know, we had a
couple spots in the neighborhood,
whatnot, where the cops wouldn&#39;t bother
you. And it was almost like, you know,
you you had arrived, you know. Um,
and I remember, you know, so it started
with a beer, let&#39;s say. But the
difference between nowadays and back
then was like, you know, back then it
was like you drank a beer, you smoked a
joint, you did a line, you popped a
pill, maybe you took some acid
mushrooms, whatever, and like no one was
dying. Um,
and from there,
you know, I think maybe that
right there that was kind of blocked. It
blocked me from It blocked you from you
didn&#39;t know. I was just It was all about
acceptance. And from there, it was like,
what do I do next? And then it was like,
okay, so now I&#39;m I I I drank with the
older kids. I drank a beer, whatnot. And
then now it&#39;s drug dealing, right? I&#39;m
looking around and I&#39;m seeing people
like, who&#39;s getting the respect? Who&#39;s
getting the who&#39;s getting the money? And
who has this, you know, it&#39;s all
materialistic stuff. And they seemed
like they they were they were it, you
know, and they they were they had it all
figured out. So what I did as opposed to
you know I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t down that
corner thinking about what my mother
taught me my father had taught me those
morals values and principles like I said
that were instilled I was um I was
following the the people that were
misinformed before me and it had nothing
to do with it wasn&#39;t a moral issue you
know it wasn&#39;t about whether they were
you know great guys right but like you
know that didn&#39;t stop them from dying
that didn&#39;t stop them from you know
spend their life in prison and stuff and
those are the people I followed. So, it
went from, you know, maybe drinking a
beer and just like partying, hanging out
with friends. And right away, it was
like right off the rip, you know, the
drug deal and stuff, maybe starting with
dime bags. Um, you know, and from there
it just progressed like what do you do
in in a neighborhood like that, right?
Like, so, well, the drug dealing, so
what&#39;s the next step, right? So, now you
got to hit a bank. Now you got to rob,
right? You got to be a stickup kid,
That&#39;s truly the reputation of Charles
Town is the robberies, the bank
robberies, the truck robberies. like
that&#39;s really the reputation. So even
when you were
growing up, was that reputation already
solidified and you kind of had an idea
like this is where I&#39;m leading to?
Yes. For as as long as far back as I can
you know, like in Good Fellas when Henry
held mom, you know, he&#39;s like ever since
I was a little kid, all I ever want to
do was be a gangster, you know? Yeah.
And I laugh like I I joke about that
stuff, right? Because like what&#39;s that
word even mean, right? you know people
the spin that is put on it. I went down
the corner like I said and like that was
already predis I was already predisposed
to that right this is what I was going
to do whether I liked it or not right so
if I was going to do it I was going to
go all in I was going to be like I
talked about that fear right little did
I know like I was I was so like consumed
with fear and like uncomfortable with
myself that like I was going to go above
and beyond and you had talked about it
in your story. I was going to go above
me or to like to to to you know make
myself official to like validate like
who I was
you know and as opposed to just you know
being that you know being Joe from a
good family and like with good with good
you know parents and like and just
following that road you know that that
was never I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t allow it to
be an option you know I was I that
acceptance meant everything to me so it
went from you know I heard all the
stories you know when from even when it
was still from sports to courts when I
was still in that phase there was a it
was glamorized you know that word there
was there&#39;s no other way I could put it
in in that era I say like my era was
probably the last of a dying breed the
last of the Moheagans where like cowboy
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know and the code that we had
bought into was you know could have been
a death sentence but it was it certainly
wasn&#39;t what it was portrayed to
And like I say, I got what I signed up
for, right? That&#39;s not who I that&#39;s not,
you know, what makes me, it was what
made me tick at the time or whatever
because I had no we talked about the
identity aspect of it. So as a kid, like
um I ran so hard right off the rip that
like, you know, from picking up that
bear at 15 years old, let&#39;s say, right?
and then starting, you know, drug
dealing and, you know, doing banks and
like then learning right away that like
the banks there&#39;s no money in the in the
there&#39;s only so much money that they
keep in the in the in the drawers,
right? No, real money&#39;s in trucks,
right? And that&#39;s the truth.
And then I blinked and um I was 21 years
old and and I was off to prison. and he
talked about it was no different than
when I showed up in that corner and and
had that beer with the older kids and
now I was um I was that guy right based
on what you what you told me I was.
It was no difference in that and then
being 21 years old and and blinking and
it was um you know I was exactly where I
was supposed to be. I was I was going to
prison, right? I got what I signed up
for and I thought I had made it but like
there was no endgame. There was nothing.
There was no endgame, bro. That was it.
And for a while, like that, you know,
that&#39;s unsustainable. For a while, like
that was, yeah, when I was a kid or
whatever, just getting through that,
that will take up enough of your time.
That&#39;s exhausting in itself to
be consumed with all of that stuff,
everything that&#39;s going on, you know,
it&#39;s clearly stimulating and like, you
know, you can kind of run with it and
base your character ultimately on on on
that. and being so, you know, as a kid,
do you kind of like you can be wild and
and it can be fun and interesting and
and then that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] gets old real quick,
you know?
Let me ask, so
when you 21 years old on your way to
prison, was that your first arrest?
It wasn&#39;t my first arrest. So this is
this was my story. So I went down the
corner and once I s when the Oxycontton
came around that was my that was it was
so lucrative that I had one I had a guy
and he was he he was he was he was the
guy he you know he supplied and it was
um supply and demand and when he
couldn&#39;t keep up right that&#39;s when we
started theies right and that&#39;s like I
say you know a big thing with me I say
like that&#39;s not a flex that&#39;s a fact you
know what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s it&#39;s we
started thearmacies and on some like
drugstore cowboy stuff, right? I never
did a robbery when I was under the
influence, right? I never did a robbery
to get drugs, right? So, you talk about
the lie that I told myself that like was
passed down from generation to
generation.
Why would I label myself anything other
than a stickup kid? Right? I&#39;m forming
my identity. This is who I am, right?
And why would I label myself anything
other than a stickup kid? Because like I
was making my bones. I was earning my
stripes. Like I was checking off the
boxes as I say. And yeah, the the whole
thing with that like you know, it went
from getting arrested for Oxycottton
twice um possession with intent,
you know, having a public defender or or
the neighborhood lawyer, you know, tell
you, oh, you know, tell the courts and
you think that you&#39;re getting away, tell
the courts, oh, you have a you have a
problem, you know. So this way maybe
they send you to gauze and all. Maybe
they, you know, and keep you out of
jail. That&#39;s the goal, right? To stay
out of jail. No.
Until you can&#39;t.
And then the law steps in and that was a
game changer for me because like I
wasn&#39;t stopping, you know? I was on a
mission um a dead end mission and the
law stepped in and and my it was almost
like three strikes are out. So went from
like teenage [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like possession with
that those two times where it was like
you know maybe a few hundred oxycontton
or something like that cuz the
oxycontton at that point it was the late
90s and I went away in 2000 I was the
first one to go away for the Oxycontton
again not a flex of fact where they it
was still a fat it hadn&#39;t yet become an
you know it was almost everyone had fun
with it As crazy as that sounds, you
know, especially in today today
and I talked about how kids like
nowadays the difference between like 25
years ago was,
you know, you think about, you know, we
drank, we, you know, had a beer, we
smoked a joint, we did a line, we bought
the bill, like people weren&#39;t dying,
right? they would maybe be hung over the
next day or something like that. But you
chalk it up like you know you you know
you live hard, you know, you play hard,
you know, and um as long as you show up
for work and like and take care of your
take care, you know, provide for your
family and all those things. But
like I said, yeah, so it was the two
arrests for the Oxycontton and then and
then shortly after that 21. So like you
see where 15 16 and like I say like my
childhood at the end of the day was like
a fiveyear run right of that like that&#39;s
that was like this is who Joe is right
so and now I come home at 30 years old
because like I say like I&#39;m 21 years old
I blink and all of a sudden I&#39;m 30 years
old and I come home and I go see my
mother in the neighborhood and I&#39;m
feeling good because I&#39;m riding that
wave that high that euphoria of like
coming home and like making it through.
But meanwhile, like I have no life
skills. I have no tools, right? Because
I didn&#39;t I certainly didn&#39;t grow up in
prison, right? I just survived. Like
I&#39;ve already like that&#39;s what I mean
about our neighborhoods and like the
where we come from, right? We were
taught that, right? Like God God bless.
Like thank God for our families. We were
taught how to survive, but at the same
time, that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not going
to suffer in the process.
And when I came home, you know, like I
was I was the one thing I was a little
older and I had OG&#39;s. I had like old
heads that really took me under their
wing, you know, and I consider them
family to this day because they taught
me, you know, they taught me how to be a
man. They they they taught me how to
carry myself and they never glorified
anything. They never told me like what
they taught me like, listen, this shit&#39;s
for the birds, you know, like
and they they humbled me when I needed
to be humbled, you know? They never let
me think that I was anything that I
wasn&#39;t, right? But they also were there
when I needed them, you So they gave me
that tough love that I had had at home,
right? And they also nurtured me too,
right? Because it it was a balance of
both. And you know, like I said, I came
home and and I was 30 years old and what
I realized is like I remember saying to
myself one day like if I have to go down
the corner, right? And I wasn&#39;t that
21-y old kid anymore. So I had grown in
that way. I maybe like it was just by
default with, you know, maturing,
you know, I had walked enough laps
around that track, you know, in the feds
with these guys and I took everything in
and and I realized like, listen, if I
have to go around the corner and have
some jerk off tell me that I&#39;m a solid
dude, right? I&#39;m the jerk off, right? I
knew that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like was it made me
cringe. It was cringeworthy when I
thought about it. So, I wasn&#39;t that
scared kid anymore, you know? I had uh I
had grown in that way, but now it was a
whole other level of um you know, now
life&#39;s here because I can survive in
that environment. I can get real
comfortable in that in that environment,
you know, is and and that&#39;s the crazy
part. Like I say, we&#39;re not afraid to
die. We&#39;re afraid to live, right? So,
how do I live, man? You know,
you&#39;ve armed me with all this with with
how to not, you know, how to survive and
how to like be be strong and and and all
this stuff, but how do I live? I I have
no idea, you know. Walk me through the
Boston jail process because I&#39;ve heard
of Nashville Street. I&#39;ve heard of South
Bay. When you first got locked up, where
did they take you and what was that
experience like?
Fortunately for myself, and maybe I
wouldn&#39;t say this back then in
hindsight, but I look back and down that
street corner, right? Like this, I
wasn&#39;t um I wasn&#39;t going to school to
study law. I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t doing my
homework on that stuff. And I&#39;m
certainly not a jail house lawyer. So
from the corner, what I got was if you
get caught with a pistol, right, you get
caught with a gun, you&#39;ll do a year and
a day in Salt Bay. So that was when I
think of that like as far as like what I
was privy to, that was something I was
willing to like accept like a year and a
day, you know? Yeah.
Like without even subconsciously, I just
And what I found out, right, was that
Well, here&#39;s the thing, Joe, right? when
you&#39;re out and you&#39;re doing and and
you&#39;re you&#39;re committing robberies,
right? And you&#39;re being a cowboy and
you&#39;re riding this wave and you&#39;re the
man and you&#39;re driving new Lexuses and
and a new truck, you know, new cars and
and everyone needs you, right? and and
and you feel like that that sense of
purpose, you know, that when you cross
state lines and you have like, you know,
5,000 plus oxy cotton from like a a
robbery from a week ago and you have a
trash bag full of stuff that nowadays
you probably make a mint that you&#39;re
throwing away because all you went for
was that and that alone and you were
going to flip it and you did all that,
right? But you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up. you slipped up
and you know you had that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] still in
the truck because you weren&#39;t on point,
right? You weren&#39;t what you told
yourself, what you told yourself you
were, right? What everyone else um had
had no choice but to believe because
that&#39;s exactly who I was, right? You
know, when I have the older the older
kids that had already established
themselves or had already made a name
for themselves and they&#39;re they&#39;re
telling me that like, wow, you know, I
heard you doing big things like, man,
you talk about, you know, my chest pump
puffs out a little, you know, who I was
untouchable, right? But that wasn&#39;t that
wasn&#39;t the that wasn&#39;t the truth. That
was what I need. And at that point when
it stopped being about what I had
already proven myself, you know, it in
in terms of that for what it&#39;s worth,
it&#39;s like, okay, well, I&#39;m valid now,
right? But I had to believe the lie.
That&#39;s when I had to stop believing the
lie. And that that was that was a
problem. And it that that helped me. It
put me in um you know, bad positions for
a long time. But luckily for me, I
didn&#39;t go through I didn&#39;t get I didn&#39;t
have to go to the county jails which and
you know no, you know there
it&#39;s funny because you talk about like
that that ego where it&#39;s like I went to
federal prison, right?
So I always say there&#39;s like different
clientele, you know, I&#39;m in there with
Osama, I&#39;m on there with like people
like Osama bin Lad and the the Timothy
McVey, like I&#39;m in there with big
hitters, right? Like
you skipped you skipped the baby steps
and went right to the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah. And I laugh about that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] now
because for so long I that character
that like had that I created. I created
this character. It wasn&#39;t who I was I
wasn&#39;t taught to be this. I wasn&#39;t it.
My parents didn&#39;t raise me to be this,
But as far as like when you start
labeling like who you are like based on
a portrayal of like your neighborhood or
your or your or a reputation,
that&#39;s a problem. You know it it
well you were expected to be tough.
You&#39;re from a tough place. Everyone
around you is living the same way. It&#39;s
it&#39;s expected and if you&#39;re going to be
viewed as solid, you&#39;re going to follow
suit. And like you said, you followed
suit and you exceeded expectations.
Yeah. Yeah.
So when you what what were the charges
that uh before we break down the feeling
of being in federal prison, what were
the charges you were indicted on that
landed you in federal prison?
The charges that landed me in federal
prison were crossing state lines. So
interstate drug trafficking 924 C means
that use and carry a firearm during and
in relation to a drug trafficking crime.
when Joe Lawler when when from childtown
right when he
has something that people need and I get
a call from my buddy that&#39;s on a
scholarship in Maine um you know playing
college D1 college hockey ready to go to
like prof you know play professional
and they call me up and asked me like
you know you hold and I said always and
and I decided to make that trip to Maine
all of a sudden right like Joe&#39;s
crossing state lines and Joe and and the
feds stepped And the feds had been
investigating me prior to this. Like I
say, the feds always get what they what
they what they seek. If the feds step
in, you got problems because the reason
that the conviction rate is so high is
because they only pick up things that
are a slam dunk. And the only way that
anyone&#39;s going to fight them is if you
catch a life bid and you have nothing to
lose, right? And you&#39;ll take your
chances. Because when I plead out the
low end of my guidelines, I plead out to
111 months, which is 9 years, 3 months,
and I sit in that courtroom, my family&#39;s
there, and I&#39;m in New Hampshire,
and I&#39;m thinking to myself, patient
after I know that I&#39;d already signed
this plea, right, with with with my
lawyer, and all he&#39;s doing is advocating
and talking. And I&#39;m thinking still I&#39;m
still not accepting the fact like, no,
this is real. And I&#39;m thinking, well,
you&#39;re not that bad. Like, the judge
will see you. He&#39;ll be like, he&#39;ll see
like, you know, he&#39;ll take some pity on
you. Have some mercy.
you know, I was till the very end. I was
like, &#34;No, I can&#39;t. I&#39;m going to walk
upstairs. I&#39;m in the I&#39;m in the tank.
I&#39;m in the cages and I&#39;m pacing. I&#39;m
pacing. I&#39;m pacing.&#34;
And I It couldn&#39;t be more of a of not
the truth. I went up there and like that
judge, I don&#39;t even think he looked up,
you know?
No. He didn&#39;t give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
No. And from that point, I was, you
know, I I stopped being a human being.
And I start I I became a number and I
became a statistic and you know
0266902669748.
I&#39;ll never forget that number. That was
my federal prison number in the feds.
The last three numbers are where the
state that you&#39;re from. So 038 is
Boston. So it gets even better when I
get to the feds and you know my buddies
from the neighborhood, my homeboy, they
see I have a 748 number, right? And
they&#39;re they&#39;re like, &#34;Why you got 748?&#34;
Right. Oh, you didn&#39;t hear? Well, I I
don&#39;t know, bro. You tell me, bro.
That&#39;s that&#39;s organized crime, right?
So, now I&#39;m with I&#39;m with this dude,
that dude, you know, from uh from the
Gambino family from from, you know, uh
the guys from New York or whatever. I&#39;m
with these guys, right? And I got a 748
number, right?
Because of the because of the tag, they
can identify absolutely the crime.
That&#39;s crazy. So, in Florida, how it is
is like my DC number is C07652. You&#39;ll
never forget that
the C is for Central Florida.
Most people from Tampa will get a T. I
got [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] They gave me a C. Uh so I
used to say the C is for Cherry, my last
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And from if you&#39;re from Orlando, you get
an X. And you know, they they got the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] different everywhere. But
it doesn&#39;t relate to any crime or
anything like that. It just tells the
area. So you go in there and they&#39;re
thinking you&#39;re on some mob [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and
you&#39;re actually around these guys.
Yeah. Right. Yeah. And you talked about
I had no idea. Like I said, I had to
learn. They taught me. And thank God I
had the right people around me. But I&#39;d
be lying if I didn&#39;t sit there and tell
you that as a as a kid, 21 years old.
Like I wasn&#39;t like I wasn&#39;t debating it.
I wasn&#39;t questioning it. If you know
that 748, like that&#39;s that spoke for
right? You know,
now let me ask you though, like you
said, you skipped the juvie, the county,
went straight to the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] feds. And
when you land in the feds and you got
organized crime on your tag and you
realize the guys that you&#39;re around,
you must have felt like, &#34;Yeah, I
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I&#39;m here. I did it. I I I&#39;m
right where, you know, you didn&#39;t want
to be in prison,
But I&#39;m around the gangsters.&#34;
Yeah. Then that means looking at you,
you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] made it.
Absolutely.
What was the feeling at 21
sitting in there being like, &#34;Fuck, this
is this is it.&#34; You know, I&#39;m around the
big dogs right now. Well, the thing was
when I&#39;m around like, you know, Johnny
Klia from, you know, he&#39;s he was one of
John Gard&#39;s guys and, you know, the
Castellano hit and, you know, Lorenzo
Manino and he&#39;s, you know, the acting
boss of the Gambinos now allegedly, you
know, and these guys are the best guys,
right? And men, right? Like carry
themselves like like gentlemen. That&#39;s
what they they taught me. I learned from
them. But they were like their personas
and like what they they were bigger than
life. And I&#39;m a kid and I&#39;m like I knew
I wasn&#39;t, you know, I&#39;m not I wasn&#39;t
them, right? Nor did I, you know, but I
need but hey, if you want to, you know,
if you want to throw me in the mix, you
know what I&#39;m saying? Like, you know
what I mean? You know, I&#39;ll Yeah, I I&#39;ll
I&#39;ll uh you know, give it some time,
whatever. You know, we&#39;ll be on we&#39;ll go
by like a seniority list, you know, and
and and maybe I&#39;ll get there at some
point, but like you know, I&#39;ll take my
little I&#39;ll take my crumbs or whatever.
Like I wasn&#39;t doing mob hits, but I&#39;ll
sit at the table if you let me. Yeah,
exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I&#39;ll knock when I&#39;m
when I&#39;m done eating and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
And you know, being around those guys,
it Yeah, it definitely did. Like you I
say about the ego, like that&#39;s the whole
thing for for for so long. The
misinformation and like the labeling of
everything I had did for all the wrong
reasons. It wasn&#39;t it had nothing to do
with like wasn&#39;t the moral thing and
stuff. I mean, to me, I&#39;ll tell myself
like I was Robin Hood, you know, I steal
from the rich and give to the poor.
Like, I don&#39;t rob people, you know what
I mean? I rob institutions, right? You
know, they have they have insurance.
Like, they&#39;re insured by that. You know
what I&#39;m saying?
It&#39;s all paid. It&#39;s covered.
Yeah. And Yeah. Yeah. And I&#39;m not like
Yeah. So, I you know, I I go in a bank
or and and and you know, I&#39;m a kid or
whatever and I point the gun at someone
and I&#39;m apologizing to the lady because
I see that she has she&#39;s fearful, right?
So, I&#39;m thinking like, you know, I want
like I want to take I want like if I
don&#39;t have, I&#39;m going to take and like,
you know what I mean? I&#39;m going to get
mine and all this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] right?
But I don&#39;t want to do it like but I
also want to be
I don&#39;t want to do it on some like grimy
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] You know what I&#39;m saying? Like
it&#39;s like honorable, right? Like,
you know,
an honorable criminal.
So, what do they say? Like honor amongst
thieves, right?
That&#39;s that was my that&#39;s who that&#39;s who
I I I wanted to be, right? I want to be
an honorable criminal. Well, that&#39;s kind
of an oxymoron, right?
Um, and I was for what it was for for
all intents and purposes. That&#39;s exactly
what I was. You know what? And there&#39;s
there&#39;s guys that to this day, like I
said, like and I feel like I know that
you&#39;re the same way. We&#39;re the type of
people that like and it&#39;s about looking
at yourself that based on our loyalty,
based on like, you know, being down for
the cause and like what we what we
believe in, we we buy into it and like
and we&#39;re going to fight for we&#39;re going
to like we&#39;re going to represent it.
We&#39;re going to stand for everything that
that&#39;s worth. And in our case, what that
looks like, right, is we might be in the
wrong place at the wrong time with the
wrong person, right? And that person
next thing you know, you&#39;re an accessory
to murder and like and I always say we
we&#39;ll curl up before we&#39;ll ever roll
over, you know? And that&#39;s u that&#39;s the
truth. And what that looks like, like I
said, this isn&#39;t about like,
you know, as I sit here and tell you,
it&#39;s not that&#39;s not a flex, bro. Like
that&#39;s that&#39;s who I am at my core, but I
don&#39;t need you to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I don&#39;t need
you to know that. You know what I mean?
Like that&#39;s when when when I started
knowing and believing like all right
well this is who I am and like and that
was always good enough right as opposed
to you know in spite of what I had told
myself and like maybe what you had told
and it saved yourself a lot of headaches
a lot of a lot of a lot of uh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
you know and that&#39;s it and we talked
about you talked about the town and I
know that you had said the movie the
town we had spoke about that that the
movie the town was one of your favorite
and I&#39;ve been thinking about this like
you know recently you know you see a lot
of people fraudulence and stuff like
that where at the end of the day like
there&#39;s something to be said about
speaking your truth and like my saying
today is like you know I am the town and
like I&#39;ll elaborate on that for like the
my predecessors or like my homeboy or
like my friends that have put in work
and like that are exactly that you know
what I mean because it&#39;s not about me
like that that&#39;s what I what I mean by
that is like that&#39;s a mindset that&#39;s a
mentality right people like that people
put in work and people there was a lot
suffering that went along with that,
right? So, like you know who you are out
there, you know what I&#39;m saying? And if
you doubt that that if if you have a
problem with that or like that what what
I just said or if you if you&#39;re
insecureable or whatever, like you know,
should probably, you know, you should
you should look inside. You know what
I&#39;m saying? Because that&#39;s that has
nothing to do with anything but but but
yourself, you know, because like that
validation and stuff like I say today
like that was the case. Like I did grow
up where it was glorified like you know
if you want to make it you got to you
got to be a stickup guy right and why
could I just be a firefighter like my
father right you know it was like a
Bronx deal you know like the work man&#39;s
a sucker
you know so the the movies like put it
this way like movies are movies for a
reason right Hollywood&#39;s Hollywood it
makes for a good story it&#39;s entertaining
they don&#39;t tell you the flip side right
so when that story is like your reality
you see the side that the viewers don&#39;t
You see the side that the viewers don&#39;t
see. But it&#39;s also like us sitting here
right now. The one thing that like I try
to just keep to stay in my lane or
whatever and and focus on yourself. But
like nowadays like sometimes it&#39;s unavo
it&#39;s unavoidable. And there&#39;s nothing
worse to me where it&#39;s like you know be
who you are. Show me who you are and let
me let me decide what I want to do with
that. Right? This isn&#39;t about like
telling someone like I&#39;m not trying to
get you to believe my story. You know
what I&#39;m saying? I&#39;m just speaking my
truth. just getting it out.
I&#39;m just speaking my truth.
And we had spoke before this and a
little bit sharpening it up.
I believe I choose to believe that like
that manifests like that&#39;s attractive,
you know, that to me that&#39;s appealing,
that&#39;s intriguing. So all these things
that before like you told me like or at
least I I thought that you know this was
this is what looked good and this is
what felt good and now I have now I base
it on my own my own experience of it,
right? And maybe if we didn&#39;t go through
that stuff, we wouldn&#39;t feel the same
way. No, I&#39;m not going to sit here and
glorify that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] But like at the end
of the day, like I said, I wasn&#39;t raised
to be that. But like, does that mean
that I&#39;m not No, no, I am that, right? I
am the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] town, right? But
with that being said, that doesn&#39;t like
you don&#39;t get points for that. You know
what I mean? Like that don&#39;t that
doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not to I don&#39;t need that
to make myself feel good, you know? And
and I would say to a kid, any kids
growing up and stuff like that today, I
would tell them the truth just like
those the the OG&#39;s and like the old
heads that that put me under their wing
had taught me, you know, and I would say
like I&#39;d tell them exactly the truth,
right? And let them know like, you know,
this there&#39;s there&#39;s a big world, you
know what I mean? It&#39;s too it&#39;s too good
out here, man, to to to put yourself in
those predicaments and those situations.
But it&#39;s also takes work and and stuff
like that. Like I said, we don&#39;t we we
struggle. I I struggle to how do I live?
You know, I&#39;m still trying to figure it
Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s something I&#39;ve said
before is um especially when it comes to
to violence and violence in prison,
every scar you put on somebody else
mentally sc you. And I can see, you
know, cuz I can relate to a lot of your
story. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some things that
you can relate to mine.
I can see that uh the things you&#39;ve been
through has affected you in more ways
than one, you know, and that&#39;s the thing
that people don&#39;t explain when it&#39;s
like, yeah, you want to live up to these
expectations, this reputation, you want
to earn this and that, but you don&#39;t
understand how [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you&#39;re going to
become along the way.
Because when you&#39;re in the mix, you&#39;re
fine. When you&#39;re by yourself, that&#39;s
when you realize the anxiety, the PTSD.
Absolutely.
The things that people don&#39;t understand
until they&#39;re in that experience. And
once once you have it, you can&#39;t just
get rid of it. You&#39;re stuck with it and
you got to bear that weight.
It&#39;s a blessing and a curse.
It is.
We talked about it like what was I
running from myself. You know what I&#39;m
saying? And then when I was forced to,
like I said, the law stepped in. Like
everything happens by design. Like it&#39;s
not no coincidence. I choose to believe
that. Like like I say, without hope,
like what&#39;s the point,
You know what you just said there. So
the only ways the only way that I can
make sense of things and I feel like if
someone can get something out of that
just us having a conversation and and in
and talking about these things because I
may I may think it in my head but to be
able to express it or convey it. You
know I had talked about Ian Bick. You
know I went on his podcast before and
then he gave me a little platform and
shout out to Ian.
Yeah. Shout out to Ian. And I remember I
went on there, the feedback, like the
reviews were like people and I honestly,
bro, we I do a podcast with my friend
Devin and you&#39;re going to meet him soon.
Um, you guys you guys have been in touch
or whatnot and it&#39;s called the Lace Up
Podcast, but I I&#39;ll I&#39;ll hit that at the
end. And I&#39;ve never watched an episode,
bro. I&#39;ve never watched one on my own.
You know what I mean? I couldn&#39;t sit
through one on my own, let alone [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
watching someone else&#39;s, right? But I&#39;ll
pick up little like snippets and people
will like putting a lot of negative [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like I didn&#39;t even know but people will
like be like oh bro like oh you know
you&#39;re doing good or whatever like I&#39;m
like the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you even talking
about? And it&#39;s funny because I thought
about it I&#39;m like that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] does doesn&#39;t
phase me but at the same time it&#39;s
almost like
it kind of I&#39;m a human being right so
it&#39;s kind of like you know we were
talking about that like keyboard
gangsters of people like throwing [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
out there like trolls and stuff like
that. It&#39;s like, bro, how about this?
Like, when I say like I&#39;m the talent,
it&#39;s like, yeah, the good, the bad, and
the ugly of it, bro. You know what&#39;s
that look like? Right. It&#39;s not about me
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sitting here and being able to,
you know, I don&#39;t give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] if you if
if I say like too much, if I say, you
know, if I stutter, right? It&#39;s like
that&#39;s called PTSD, right? That&#39;s called
going through [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] or whatever and being
a human being, right? So,
I&#39;m not here to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like tell a
story to to entertain you. I&#39;m not a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] monkey in a circus. You know
what I&#39;m saying?
You know, growing up where you grew up,
you&#39;re taught in the household not to
snitch on your friends. You&#39;re taught
how to be tough. You&#39;re taught how to
You&#39;re not taught how to respond to
trolls on the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] internet.
That was never a thing that was cuz
nobody gives a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about that. Because
one thing the internet&#39;s done is it&#39;s
given a voice to people that don&#39;t speak
in the street.
That weren&#39;t never on a corner, that
never came outside. It&#39;s given a voice
to people that have never lived that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] life%
and they&#39;re trying to judge people that
actually have. But speaking on
validation,
I do want to say one one last thing.
When I&#39;ve heard you on the way down down
here to Tampa to come uh to link up,
Devin had put on some of your previous
podcast and the one thing like I was
sitting there and I just kind of I was
closing my eyes or whatever and he&#39;s
driving and I was listening and one of
the things that I I said to him I said
that&#39;s not taught, right? You can&#39;t
that&#39;s learned. So when I heard you
speak, the one thing I can tell you is
that and I&#39;d put, you know, I don&#39;t
gamble anymore because um, you know, I
run I run into problems, but I&#39;d put my
life on the line like when it comes to
like my judgment, you know, like judge
of character, right?
And I think that&#39;s one thing that we
learned in the situation we&#39;ve been
through. When I heard you speak,
whatever. And Devon had said like, you
know, no one let me in anywhere. Like I
kicked the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] door in, you know,
and when I hear someone speak like that,
you&#39;re humble, but you&#39;re also like
whether it&#39;s for maybe that is part of
like the trolls and stuff like that
where it&#39;s like like you don&#39;t get to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tell my story. You don&#39;t you
know what I mean? I tell my story.
Yeah. When people ask, &#34;Oh, how did Jake
become a factor in hip-hop? Who let him
and no one let me in? I kicked the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] door and now I&#39;m here.&#34;
That&#39;s how you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] do it. Yeah.
Absolutely, man. No, for real. You can&#39;t
say that unless Put it this way. You can
say whatever you want, right? But it&#39;s
not going to be received or like you
know you can&#39;t actually be respected
unless people know that&#39;s actually what
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happened.
Yeah. Real recognizes real man.
For sure. When speaking on validation
trying to validate yourself
that&#39;s a big component within the
federal prison system from what I&#39;ve
heard. I&#39;ve only done state time.
but from what I&#39;ve heard is the second
you go in there you have to validate
yourself. And it&#39;s not just all right
you did some street [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] We want to see
your paperwork and this is gonna 100%
this is going to decide who the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you
get to be around. Now hearing that you
were already around gangsters and you
know mob hits and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that guys.
It was official guys. I&#39;m sure you
checked out but what was the experience
like for you having to be told look we
need to see your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and we&#39;re going to
decide where you go.
Absolutely.
Talk about an experience like I joke
around. I say like I&#39;m 21 years old. I&#39;m
going from MDC Brooklyn to fly conair
and and then I&#39;m and then I&#39;m hitting
Pennsylvania. I&#39;m hitting this like
world that I had never experienced,
right? And like it&#39;s something that
you&#39;d have to you&#39;d have to go through
yourself. And I hit the I I hit the
buses. I&#39;m on the bus and there&#39;s like I
I joke but it&#39;s the it was the truth. I
grew up in a neighborhood like white
Irish Catholic. Okay. In Boston it was
like very segregated, right? So the
neighborhoods like whites, you had a
white area, it was so segregate, it was
so segregated where you&#39;d have white a
white neighborhood that was Irish and
you have across the bridge is the is the
little Italy, you know.
So it was very it wasn&#39;t just white. It
was like by you know nationality and
stuff like that.
And when I hit that when I went on that
bus after flying corner, the one thing
that my neighborhood taught me and
growing up in like the inner city was I
had never been around other cultures. I
had never been around, you know, black
people, Spanish people and stuff like
that. But when I was on that bus, I may
have like fear of unknown of like what
to expect, but there was no fear of
like, oh, this dude&#39;s like a different
color than me or some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that.
You know what I mean? Like that that&#39;s
one thing that was like bred in me bred
in like being from the inner city. And
you know, on the bus it was like I think
there was if you want there was me. I
joke around like I was the white boy.
You had a Canadian which is like I guess
the half you know white boy and then you
had like a a dude from like Brockton or
whatever, right? That and like where I&#39;m
from it&#39;s like you know what I mean?
Like does he you know is he white black?
I don&#39;t know what he you know I mean if
he don&#39;t know what he is like you know
what I&#39;m saying? And it&#39;s funny because
growing up like as a kid like that&#39;s I
looked around and I&#39;m like it had
nothing to do with the bus and like the
culture and the people I was around and
like what color they were. It was when I
hit Lewisburg and I&#39;m I&#39;m at a holdover
and I joke like I&#39;m like Andy Defrain
like in um Shaw Shank Redemption. I&#39;m
looking around and it&#39;s so overwhelming
because it&#39;s like a castle. It&#39;s like
dude where the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] am I?
And then I
you know but at the same time being from
that neighborhood and the perks that it
would have and also like I talk about
like the false sense of pride. It served
its purpose a lot of the time where when
I hit that compound, right, they had
already knew I was coming, right, cuz
word travels and like and and they had
already had my care package set up,
right? And they already told me like
they gave me the ins and outs, right?
Like I just followed suit, you know?
So they already had [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] for you like
when you
they had everything ready everything
ready for me.
What were you told? Like were you told
like, &#34;Yeah, you got to stick with the
whites and then these are the specific
whites you&#39;re going to be with.&#34;
Yeah. No, they they no one told me
nothing. The the Boston the Boston car,
you know, the guys that if in the in in
the language like the the jail language
or the prison language or whatnot, you
know, not necessarily that we call it
that, but like yeah, they called they
were the shot callers. They held the
keys to the yard or whatnot. I say it
all the time about Boston, for what it&#39;s
worth. Um it may not mean much to in in
everyday life, but if you&#39;re in that
environment, Boston has the best
reputation. you know, and that&#39;s and
that has nothing to do with me. That has
to do with like I was just one of one of
many, but like that that came from years
and years like the pred like the people
that put in work before. So, you know,
just to keep that it it it&#39;s a good
feeling, you know. So, there was no one
no one telling me anything except the
people that needed to and the and why
wouldn&#39;t I fall right in line, you know,
you know, it wasn&#39;t uh
I trusted them right off the rip. Even
though I knew, you know, I trusted them
right, I still held on to that and like
they didn&#39;t at the end of the day, I
guess they didn&#39;t prove me wrong. Like
it confirmed exactly it confirmed good
things, you know what I mean? So they
took me out of the wing and you know I
gave them they said, &#34;Yeah, this is what
you got to do. You got to you know, you
know, grab your paperwork, whatever.&#34;
And they presented it, you know, they
did what they had to do right here.
Confirmed everything and everything was
Now you&#39;re with the Boston car and the
feds. They have a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] outstanding
reputation in the feds. So, you know,
you&#39;re around some solid guys. Was your
car getting into any conflicts with
other cars or were you witnessing any
violence going on in the places that you
were at?
So, the one that the difference between
I&#39; I don&#39;t know, you might have heard
the saying before. They say like there&#39;s
a saying that says like the state is
like a a physical incarceration as
opposed to like the feds being a mental
incarceration.
And there&#39;s some truth in that, but at
the same time, like there&#39;s different
levels. There&#39;s penitentiary, right?
There&#39;s highs, there&#39;s mediums, there&#39;s
lows, and then there&#39;s like um camps
that either for rats or like dudes like
white collar criminals and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like
that, you know?
Um we don&#39;t make it there. We don&#39;t go
to camps, you know what I&#39;m saying?
Unless you&#39;re like a kid and like your
your points are real low, you know, and
you have a a skid bid, you know? But
chances are like, no, you you&#39;re
you&#39;re going you&#39;re going into the
you&#39;re not you&#39;re not going to be in a
camp. You&#39;re not going to have a chance
to like maybe like, you know, leave or
whatever, right? You&#39;re going to be in a
prison environment in a prison setting
and you&#39;re going to do time and you&#39;re
going to have to get into a routine.
When I went there, like I said, the
clientele was was different.
When [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] popped off,
it popped off, but it wasn&#39;t an everyday
stress like that. It was almost like
there wasn&#39;t that heaviness that I that
I noticed with family, friends,
acquaintances that like that I grew up
with that did stay time. I think I would
be I I know for a fact 100% that I would
be a different person and that it would
have that it would sh it would have
shaped me differently if I had done
state time as opposed to the fed time.
You know, the way they people carry
themselves they like I said it wasn&#39;t
about so as far as proving and like
letting people know like
yeah they had their story of who they
you know who they were or whatever but
not necessarily had to put in work when
they got there. It was like their
reputation like their it stood for
itself, you know, right?
And if need be,
like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happened, you know what I
mean? And like they weren&#39;t no crash
dummies like they were the guys that
were established like were were official
from the jump like right they came off
the street official, you know?
So they didn&#39;t have to prove anything.
Everyone knew.
No. What?
And there was plenty of guys willing to
to you know
to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] do it to you.
Absolutely.
21 years old with nine years in the
What was your first time seeing an act
of violence in the feds?
In the feds. Um
like stabbings and stuff like that, you
You were seeing that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah. But but not not as much as like
like I said, I probably there would be
in New Hampshire County jail, right?
like over there would be more frequent
but that would be dudes like cutting up
or something like there&#39;d be more stuff
like that seeing like either violence or
you know beefing as opposed like in the
feds like I say it would it&#39;s hard to
explain but the guys that were there
was a lot of unspoken stuff there was a
lot of things that you know unwritten
rules or whatnot but basically
it was kind of like you you got in like
you fell in line, but there was an air
about it as opposed to like no one was
unsure of themselves there, you know, in
in that aspect. Everyone was pretty much
like you got a compound in the f you got
a you got a whole compound of guys like
hundreds of guys that that that
think they&#39;re the man, right? Right.
They they they know, right? They have to
be, right? Like that&#39;s gonna get them
through their time. That&#39;s gonna that&#39;s
probably how they survived on the
street, right? And you talk about all
that like those egos like all together.
So now there&#39;s just a hierarchy, right?
And if something if something&#39;s going to
go on or whatever, then it&#39;s going to be
for something like worth it. You know
what I mean? It&#39;s if if dudes are
getting shipped out or like because it&#39;s
not even about like, oh, we&#39;re not going
to fight and like, you know, we&#39;re going
to go the whole and like maybe the loser
gets shipped out or something like that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Not in that in that situation.
Like no, it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;re coming for
the they&#39;re coming for your head. You
know what I mean? And not that they
don&#39;t do that other places, but it was
almost like it was there was going to be
an end to it. It wasn&#39;t going to carry
on, you know? There was they were
looking for how do we, you know, they
were looking to end it right there, you
know? Like that was the they were
looking to put an exclamation point on
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] So,
and was there a time when you witnessed
somebody get taken out in the feds?
Not really. Not like killed or whatever,
but you know, definitely stabbings and
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that and fights or whatnot.
People in the whole thing with the feds
where there&#39;s something to be said about
it. People aren&#39;t dummies, right? Like
we might get there like guys might get
there and be on some some different [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
or whatever and but when they get there
like when like there&#39;s certain perks or
whatever, it could be not being locked
down, you know, 24 hours a day, right?
People like people act accordingly.
Yeah. They don&#39;t want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that up.
People act accordingly. And not only do
they act accordingly, but they want to
part of that is like being hypervigilant
and making sure that you act
accordingly, you know?
So it was that was easy. like that kind
of just came came with it and I just
follow followed suit and thank God like
I said coming from Boston or whatever or
and I know that&#39;s not everyone&#39;s
experience where if you don&#39;t have the
right people leading you I don&#39;t care if
you&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on the street if you&#39;re
in prison like in life in general right
because you know out of sight out of
mind but people that are like there like
they&#39;re still alive bro you know what I
mean like they&#39;re still you might not
see them and stuff like that but they&#39;re
they&#39;re feeling what they&#39;re feeling
they&#39;re they&#39;re going through their day
they&#39;re just trying to get through a day
like anyone else you know
after in nine years you come home. What
is that like?
Un unprepared.
I hate when I hear guys say like I grew
up in I grew up in prison. I grew up in
like who the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you? Like stop
playing, will you? That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] to me is
like it&#39;s foolish, right? Because it
sounds so silly. There&#39;s no growth
there. There was no growth from the time
I went down the corner and like and and
and I and ran with an ideology, ran with
like this this reputation that was
created by like fiction, you know what
I&#39;m saying,
Um and it created a lot of that&#39;s the
whole thing with Hollywood and like
entertainment and like Yeah, people love
seeing [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about that&#39;s all intriguing,
appealing. Not for me, bro. Not for the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] families.
There&#39;s plenty of people that aren&#39;t on
on here that are doing life in prison,
right? Good people, too, right? Not
everyone in prison is a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bag that
would certainly, you know, give that
time back, all that time back and all
that. Those accolades or like I said,
then have you, you know, think like
they&#39;re they&#39;re people, you know, they
they they go through things. They have
families, right, that that are that
suffer and that go go through it with
them. I think our families, you know,
the people out here, bro, it&#39;s harder
out here than it is in there. Um, in my
experience, that that&#39;s what I&#39;ve said.
You know, prison, yes, it&#39;s not an ideal
place. It&#39;s not the place um you&#39;d want
to be. And does bad [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happen? Yeah.
Right. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone,
that&#39;s for sure. That&#39;s why people, you
know, there&#39;s I&#39;m big on like prison
reform. The I I do want to real quick is
that I remember being in the feds and I
hate the politics, right? And that&#39;s one
thing you talk about like there is
politics and like it serves its purpose.
But I remember like getting to that
getting to the low and getting I was
getting short on time. And the hardest
part of of my sentence those 111 months
was the beginning, right? And like going
carnair and like diesel treatment like
cuz they&#39;ll bounce you around and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like that especially if you&#39;re a
problem, right? So right away they&#39;re
kind of forming you and shaping you and
molding you like listen you&#39;re going to
do what we tell you, right? And then the
when you&#39;re getting short and like as a
different type of anxiety, right?
Because once you get in your routine,
it&#39;s that&#39;s doable, right? Like I say,
anyone can do time, bro, right? It&#39;s
about how you going to come out, right?
Like, you know, people think it&#39;s like I
don&#39;t give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] right? Like, and in
my neighborhood, like it was like
people would wear that as a badge of
honor, right? And thank God like I&#39;m,
you know, I was sharp enough where my
parents like they raised me properly
where like I knew right when I was old
enough and like mature enough um to get
that like I was like I called it exactly
what it was, you know, and called it
right out.
But coming home, it was a shark. I had
no life skills. Um I wasn&#39;t ready. I
wasn&#39;t ready for it. And I rode that
wave until and it was unsustainable. And
it all came back like I would these
little short bursts of like purpose,
right? And coming home and starting a
family and raising kids and being like
again the whole labeling thing, right?
Um it&#39;s all feel good. What what can
make Joel feel good? Well, as a kid,
right, made me feel good for you to
think that like something about me that
like meant something on the street,
right? And now it&#39;s feels good because
like um I&#39;m raising two kids and you
know I got a wife at home and I&#39;m I&#39;m
being the family guy but I have no clue
how to be a family guy. I have no clue
how to provide. I didn&#39;t look up to my
dad who was a firefighter who fought in
Vietnam and was the was a great guy
because it wasn&#39;t enough for me to just
be a good guy, right? I needed more be
and more than that and therefore I
looked to things that weren&#39;t that you
know that basically led me to where
where I went and
you know if I could take any of it back
like I said you know the the same person
that like I didn&#39;t look up to was the
same person and I always say we get the
good and the bad from our parents people
love to hang on to
hang on to the bad stuff because it
hurts more right and the thing the thing
with that being said like you know I
wouldn&#39;t we get the good and the bad
with it or whatever but you know I think
that I I I always say I&#39;d like to think
that like love trumps all or whatever
that unconditional love and but in the
process it comes with you know you got
to go through you got to go through your
learning stuff you know just like you
have and out here what I try to do on a
daily basis is just you know put my best
foot forward and the thing with today is
like if I know that I tried my best that
day when it stop being about, you know,
trying to trying to set the stage and
like play a character and like so
everyone so this is what Joe&#39;s life
looks like when I can put my head on the
pillow and know I try my best that day
because some days a lot of the time my
best is you know it doesn&#39;t meet
expectations it&#39;s not up to standard you
know but now I&#39;ve raised the level of uh
you know what I do expect but at the
same time try to give myself a little
grace you know and because I know that
I&#39;ve heard and I&#39;ve heard you speak
we&#39;re super critical super hard on
ourselves you know and I say like Bro, I
don&#39;t need someone on the internet. I
don&#39;t need anyone to beat me up, bro.
You can&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you can&#39;t hurt me more
than [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I can hurt myself, you
know? And there&#39;s a saying about like
you can&#39;t kill the willing, bro. You
know, like
what are you going to do? Beat me up,
bro? Like, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I don&#39;t even like
myself half the time. You know what I&#39;m
saying? Like, so that and I, you know,
we were talking about um earlier being
down here and and being in different
environments. The one thing that I can
say was worth it and I can take pride in
today, like a healthy pride, is the fact
like Joey Molino says that like we can
go anywhere, right? We can go anywhere.
That&#39;s a good [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] feeling, bro. You
know what I&#39;m saying?
I can walk and the the even to add to
that, my parents, those citizen people
that are knockound people, my father can
go down the street and play kino and no,
the kids in the corner aren&#39;t going to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with them. my mother can there&#39;s
something to be said about that like
she&#39;s proud of me and in a way where
it&#39;s like I be it&#39;s it&#39;s child sounds a
crazy place but it&#39;s almost like dude
your parents should take pride that like
yeah because nowadays unfortunately I
don&#39;t know when that ever became a thing
or whatever but like people recanting or
telling that was never a thing bro right
you&#39;re not supposed to get like they&#39;re
not going to throw a parade you don&#39;t
get points for not telling you you were
never supposed to yeah
and now you hear dudes like it&#39;s almost
like all right
You know,
it&#39;s crazy. But like for your family to
be able to keep their head up, to be
able to to be proud of that, right? I
don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know when it
changed, but like it has to count for
something because what&#39;s out there is a
lot of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and a lot of
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] false, you know, fraudulence,
whatnot, you know? So, it&#39;s like, how do
we fight back? Like, oh, the best thing
I can do, we can sit here and have a
real conversation, right? we can speak
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] truth and and you know
challenge that. You know what I&#39;m
saying? And like and
just be real,
right? Because I say like you know where
they smoke there&#39;s fire and uh you know
they I&#39;m you know nowadays obviously
it&#39;s different like yeah could someone
throw a jacket on you or something like
that. Yeah, of course it happens right
but chances are dude you know what? No
one can say nothing bad about me cuz
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I didn&#39;t I never [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] did
anyone dirty. So you know what I mean?
So and you get in where you fit in. Like
that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing. So I know
that&#39;s a big thing with you where people
people come and if I I think there&#39;s two
different people, right? Like and and
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] never lies where that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like I try to speak out against that
like and I feel like we you know you&#39;re
like a freedom fighter where it&#39;s like
bro you don&#39;t get to speak like just
live your life stay in your lane or
whatnot but when I hear someone like
being questioned or judged or whatever
and stuff like that and it&#39;s like who
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you bro? You know what I&#39;m
saying? Like who knows you? That that&#39;s
a saying we&#39;d say like who knows you
bro. I think the thing for me is I send
a lot of shots.
and when you&#39;re sending shots,
eventually
they&#39;re going to come back your way,
You know, that&#39;s just how it is. Like,
I&#39;m out here exposing people&#39;s favorite
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] rappers.
They&#39;re going to try to say anything
about me to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
alleviate the situation I just caused.
But it is what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] it is. And just
as far as perspective goes,
sometimes I got to remind myself, I got
over a million subscribers,
a million people that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with me, a
million people rock with me, right?
Absolutely.
There&#39;s going to be at least a thousand
people that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hate me.
But that thousand
doesn&#39;t matter when there&#39;s a million
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] love me.
Of course.
You know, and that&#39;s the thing that I
try to think of. But let me ask you
right now, you got the podcast.
And I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about
the trolls.
Yeah. Yeah,
but uh what what for you is the purpose?
What is the message you&#39;re trying to
push out and how does it help you?
Well, I&#39;m glad you asked that. So,
the Lace Up podcast, um you can find
that on YouTube or whatnot. Like, this
shit&#39;s all new to us, right?
The thing the message that we&#39;re trying
to convey, right? So, lace up is like a
term you&#39;d hear in like prison, right?
Like we don&#39;t walk around with shower
shoes on, bro. Right. Right. Right away,
that&#39;s a red flag, right? You don&#39;t wear
shower shoes, right? you you&#39;re always
ready, right? And like, you know, it&#39;s
saying like lace up. Like, you know, you
better be ready. You know, you have to
be ready. You got to be on point. You
got to you got to move militant. And how
that carries over to the street, right?
And it&#39;s a it&#39;s a cool catchy saying to
me because what it says to me is like I
want people Everyone has a story, right?
Everyone has a story. Tell your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
story, bro. Right. I can&#39;t help it if
you know what I mean. I earn the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
if for what it&#39;s worth, bro. And I&#39;ll
tell you it&#39;s not worth much, right? But
you don&#39;t like and the same for you. And
that&#39;s why I say like I get passionate
about it because you don&#39;t get to tell
my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] story, right? It I know what
I&#39;ve been through, right? And if
someone&#39;s going to speak it, it&#39;s going
to be me, right? Because it&#39;s my story
and it&#39;s the truth, right?
And I&#39;m okay with that. And the thing is
I want we want to convey the message
that like how do you get through
adversity? Everyone everyone goes
through adversity, right? How do you
bounce back? How do you Because to me
like that right there is that&#39;s the hope
we talk about. That&#39;s what you know
having faith in and seeing people what
attracts me and like what&#39;s intriguing
to me and why you know it&#39;s an honor to
be able to sit here with you and I feel
blessed and I&#39;m grateful and I can say
that to you and look you in the eye,
right? And tell you that to have an
opportunity like this, right? That
counted for something. All that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
that misinformation, all that stuff, all
that suffering, bro, it [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] counted
for something, right? So, like that&#39;s a
good feeling, man. Right.
No, that&#39;s an amazing way to think
because I mean, even putting my own life
in perspective, you know, prison,
as much as it [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sucked, it was
everything I needed at the time cuz my
father wasn&#39;t there to teach me things
that I ended up learning in there, but
just being amongst men, seeing how
people move, seeing what respect is, and
seeing how crossing the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] line can
leave you dead.
Absolutely. And uh with where I&#39;m at now
and what I&#39;ve turned my worst life
experience into, it&#39;s become my greatest
Absolutely.
And that&#39;s why I was very excited for
y&#39;all to come down here because I love
seeing people following that same path.
Taking the thing that traumatized them
the most and turning it into something
in which not only do we share our
stories with other people that can
relate and it&#39;ll help them get through
it, but we can also be example of
pushing through it and finding success
on the other side. Of course, it goes
back to what I said about that purpose.
I always searched for that. I ran for
myself, right? So, there was no I didn&#39;t
even have a chance to I wasn&#39;t looking
for no purpose, bro. I don&#39;t want no
responsibilities. I&#39;m I don&#39;t want I
want to be the man, right? But I don&#39;t
want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] be, you know, I don&#39;t
want I want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I want you to see
me, but I don&#39;t want all the attention.
You know what I mean? Like, you can&#39;t be
both, bro. Right? So, pick something,
right? You can&#39;t be a gangster and and
and be you like pick one, bro. And the
thing is when I use that word like I say
now and I I feel like I know that you
get it but it&#39;s like bro I don&#39;t at the
end of the day like people that are
trolls and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that like I got
this to say right because and I get
passionate about it where like gangster
bro right like you know what like I&#39;ve
learned like what a real gangster is
like showing up for their family provide
them right learning from their mistakes
and helping someone out right how can
you turn your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] pain into into
some into a purpose. How can you turn
your pain into purpose and help another
person? Right? Because what that shows
me is like that your core is who you
were. You were you were that have you
learned things along the way? Like and
you needed to figure that out. Like
if I would that&#39;s what I mean but I
wouldn&#39;t change it if if I could.
So if you&#39;re going through something
like you may not understand it but like
hang the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on bro. Hang on because
there&#39;s two different people and and if
we&#39;re going to do this like we&#39;re going
to do it right. Right. And if we&#39;re
gonna make money, it&#39;s like, and if
you&#39;re gonna make money and be a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
fraud, bro,
let us get that, right? No, no, hold up,
hold up. You don&#39;t No, let us get that
back. You know what I&#39;m saying? Right.
So, I I look at it that way. And,
you know, to be able to
I wouldn&#39;t be able to do it on my own.
I&#39;ve needed, you know, like to to see
you and like, but if we don&#39;t open our
mouths, like a closed mouth don&#39;t get
fed. So, I need people need to open
their mouth and talk, right? It may not
be always eloquent and always come off,
but if you speak the truth, like I say,
you can&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up the truth, man. And
what I&#39;ve learned is that when I&#39;ve
spoken my truth, um, I&#39;ve got blessings
in my life and like people the right
people have have attracted to me and
I&#39;ve manifested those types of things
and and and just being okay with that
and, you know, to see the humility. I
feel like I love being around people and
it inspires me. It motivates me, right?
I don&#39;t want what you have, bro. Right.
I just wanted to be okay with me. I
never never at my worst day did I ever
want to be anyone but me, right? But I
had to figure out how to do that. You
know what I&#39;m saying?
Be the best version of yourself.
Absolutely. And I see the same in you.
You know,
I love that, bro. And I appreciate you
coming on. Definitely shout out your
podcast one more time.
Lace up podcast. Uh like and subscribe.
And you know, I&#39;m kind of it&#39;s kind of
new to the whole YouTube thing or
whatnot, but you know, I&#39;m going to I&#39;m
going to try to peel my ears, listen,
learn, or whatnot. and you know keep
moving together. You know I can&#39;t do it
alone. I don&#39;t want to nor do you know
do I have to and you know it&#39;s a
blessing to be able to do things with
you. You know it it says everything
about your character. You know as far as
I&#39;m concerned and you know to have this
opportunity. I&#39;m just grateful and you
