It&#39;s how horrible what Israel is doing
is and it&#39;s how clearly it&#39;s not in our
national interest. This is destroying
our domestic tranquility. We got
protests. We got people fighting over
this stuff. We&#39;re pissing off the Muslim
world again, which we&#39;ve already had to
deal with, at least to Ahud Omar and
Ahud Barack, both former prime ministers
of Israel, have come out and said
Netanyahu is committing war crimes. So
that&#39;s where your debate is at this
point. So recently Dave Smith went on
Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast to explain why the
Israel first argument is dead and how 22
months after Israel&#39;s war path of
destruction in Gaza, so many Americans
have come to believe that this mentality
of supporting Israel at all costs is
counterintuitive. He gets real fired up
in this one. So let&#39;s take a look at
this. Please like the video and
subscribe to the channel. It&#39;s it&#39;s you
know I was just uh looking at this the
other day though where it&#39;s like which
is really you know even to me is is kind
of something I would not have been able
to even fathom or predict a couple years
ago but the way in which every
demographic has turned against Israel uh
over this in Gaza it except
essentially boomer Republicans who are
still as strong as they&#39;ve ever been in
supporting them but every you know
Israel is it&#39;s it&#39;s really in many ways
is like the third rail of American pol.
Like this is the thing you are not
allowed to talk about. This is the thing
that would get you fired from CNN, would
get you kicked out of DC, would get your
to your career ruined. You know, Pat
Buchanan made a joke once on the MLAN
group like years ago, like decades ago.
He made a joke once where he said
something about he said Congress is
Israel occupied territory or something
like that. And he for the rest of his
career this was the scandal. this was
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well he had a pretty good case for that
and more and more so but Dave&#39;s right I
guess this is the third rail boomer
conservatives still supporting Israel
but the rise of the independent media I
think has made a lot of people question
this relationship for the first time hit
pieces were written about this now the
the guy the young people are totally
outside of that ecosystem and they&#39;re
just hearing from different people and
they&#39;re like no I&#39;m not buying it and
it&#39;s you know I think it&#39;s a mix of a
few things like I think it&#39;s it&#39;s just
that you know we have the technology
it&#39;s in 4K you can see what Israel is
doing to Gaza it is so evil that it&#39;s
damn near impossible to to find a way I
mean some people do but it is really
difficult to find a way to be like I&#39;m
actually okay with that it&#39;s been going
on for for uh years at this point um and
then the the second thing is just that
like the relationship between the US
government and the Israeli government is
so freaking bizarre that once you see it
and once a whole generation of young
people see it, it&#39;s like impossible for
them to unsee it and and you know, it&#39;s
just too New York City mayoral politics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Like this is and and the idea that
it is, you know, the idea that it&#39;s just
accepted as normal that the politicians
for your country must worship this other
country. And you&#39;re like, so what it did
that other country like beat us in a war
and they&#39;re occupying us now? Yeah, it&#39;s
so perverted. And you see this
ritualistically play out as US
politicians and the US presidents go
over to Jerusalem. They cry on the wall.
They put on a yarmaka. They go through
that process. It&#39;s a humiliation ritual.
Does the speaker of the Knesset do that
in the United States? You know, worship,
you know, the Washington memorial cry on
the Vietnam wall. No, of course not.
This is an odd relationship. People are
waking up to it and it is so absurd. But
Dave&#39;s exactly right. It is because this
is being streamed now. It&#39;s in our face.
I actually think there would have been a
lot more opposition to the Iraq war for
instance early on if you had so many
videos and you know torturous
situations, all the destruction, all the
rubble, children being pulled up dead
from the rubble, the starvation campaign
that we have going, the GHF closing down
400 aid stations, reducing it to four.
Things like that would be in our face
and that&#39;s why they tried to ban
Twitter. Let&#39;s just be real about it.
They might ultimately succeed in that.
But the idea that it was over China was
absurd. So Dave&#39;s right. It is the third
rail in politics. Tides are changing.
People&#39;s mentalities are shifting in
this direction. It hasn&#39;t panned out in
political outcomes yet. I hope it will
in the future. I have no doubt that it
will to some extent in 10 years. Will
Apac lose all of its power? Probably
not, but it is heading in that
direction.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you&#39;re like, &#34;No, no, you&#39;re the
superpower. They&#39;re your welfare
country, you know, but yet you must go
kiss their wall. You must say Tammy
Bruce from the State Department.
Literally just And I know she was kind
of being tongue and cheek, but where she
goes, &#34;We&#39;re the greatest country in the
world.&#34; Well, second greatest to Israel.
Like, what
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; was she being tongue and cheek?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know exactly. She kind of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; weird.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I watched that video and I don&#39;t
think she was tongue and cheek. Like,
honestly, watch that video. Don&#39;t take
it from me. Don&#39;t take my word for it,
but it seemed like she was being honest
about that opinion. It was a very it&#39;s
still that is a weird thing for any
representative of your government to say
if anyone sat there and said just went
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know I think America is the greatest
country in the world. Well Finland I
guess is the greatest and we&#39;re number
two. You&#39;d be like what? I&#39;m like
Finland&#39;s a cool country. I got nothing
against them but what are you talking
about? You know and but really I do
think the uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well it&#39;s it&#39;s the relationship. It&#39;s
how horrible what Israel is doing is and
it&#39;s how clearly it&#39;s not in our
national interest, but how bad the
Israeli PR game is, you know, and that
like it&#39;s almost like they were just so
accustomed to the old way of doing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;re so accustomed to people being
terrified of being labeled anti-semitic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. You someone criticizes you, you
label them as a bigot and you destroy
their lives and and that works doesn&#39;t
work anymore.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Minor jokes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Well,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yes. Some people are still scared about
that. I can&#39;t really blame them. But
Dave&#39;s right. It&#39;s not working anymore
to the extent that it once did. And
Dave&#39;s right. Even if you sympathize
with Israel to an extent compared to say
the Palestinians, this is a backward
policy regardless. It&#39;s not America
first. Why intervene and get into these
entangling alliances that the founders
warned about? It doesn&#39;t pay us any
dividend. It doesn&#39;t give us any
benefit. Americans aren&#39;t helped in
buying groceries easier or filling up
their cars with fuel. It&#39;s just a
backward policy and it really expands
all the turmoil that we feel
domestically because the Fed prints
money to support it and fund it and we
go into debt to support it and we&#39;re $37
trillion in debt now because of
supporting Israel at all costs. Not just
that, but that&#39;s a big contributing
factor. Well, and there&#39;s like,
you know, I think it&#39;s a so I&#39;ve been
using this like analogy or comparison
lately and I think like so if you
remember when Joe Biden had that
disastrous debate with Donald Trump and
everybody like the debate opens and
everybody watching it knows this is
over. Joe Biden is done. I mean, it was
so bad. But it&#39;s not just that it was so
bad. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s the you know,
before the debate, you know, you there&#39;s
Rachel Matto at a desk with a bunch of
people. We&#39;re now going to the first
presidential debate. Joe Biden&#39;s going
to kick his ass. They were already
talking about how it was a remember the
term deep fakes that they came up with
where it&#39;s it&#39;s or cheap fakes, I&#39;m
sorry, was cheap fakes. It&#39;s not a deep
fake, but it&#39;s kind of like a deep fake.
See, they&#39;re showing you a real video of
Joe Biden being scenile. But see, that&#39;s
just as fake as a deep fake because they
didn&#39;t include the context or something
like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. It&#39;s like saying Randy Fine is
actually a star athlete. He&#39;s a big-
time bodybuilder. I mean, in film that
you see him, he looks overweight, obese,
but you know, just behind the curtains,
if you go away from the allore of
spectacle, he&#39;s actually ripped. He&#39;s a
star athlete. He can run a, you know,
3se second 40. All this nonsense that
you would have hear about that is just
absurd as what we heard about Biden. But
Dave&#39;s right. I mean, trying to hide
that is like hiding Israel&#39;s atrocities.
Now, Americans know better. Now, that
was the talking point that right before
we go into the debate, the debate cuts,
it goes back to the same panel and they
go, &#34;We got to find a new candidate.&#34;
Like they had they acknowledge that. And
part of the reason why we all knew it
was over in that debate was it wasn&#39;t
just how bad the debate was. It was that
now you have to admit this. You know,
you were pretending this thing didn&#39;t
exist. Now you got to admit it exists.
And once you admit it exists, there&#39;s
now a microscope on Joe Biden like there
never was before. So tomorrow when he&#39;s
doing an interview and he mixes up a
name that may not have been such a big
deal two days ago, but after that debate
performance when he mixes up another
name now you&#39;re like look there it is
again he&#39;s scenile. Everything became
amplified after that point and I think
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; don&#39;t you think they set him up?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Yes. But we sure that&#39;s a whole
separate issue but yes I do think they
set him up. Um, but I think a similar
thing has happened with Israel where now
everyone&#39;s looking at it and everyone&#39;s
watching and everyone&#39;s going, &#34;Wait,
what the hell is going on here?&#34; That&#39;s
a great analogy. What What is this? So
there, wait, a pedophile can just go
flee to Israel. How many other
pedophiles have gone and fled to Israel?
What? And now it&#39;s like, &#34;Oh my god,
they&#39;ve opened Pandora&#39;s box and there&#39;s
just, I think, no way to put this back
in cuz it&#39;s too weird.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. You can&#39;t put the genie back in
the bottle. You can&#39;t put the toothpaste
back in the tube. Americans now see this
for what it is. And I think the
parallels are inescapable here. I like
that Dave compared it to the Biden
sharpest attack propaganda nonsense we
got because there are some similarities
here because when it comes to Israel,
America&#39;s minds are just, you know,
being perverted by propaganda. And then
when they see the difference play out in
terms of what leaks into independent
media and Twitter essentially, you just
can&#39;t go back on this. It changes your
life and your perspective to some extent
to the extent that people only watching
cable news will never see. Just one big
example, the other day Israel bombed a
hospital on live television. But there
was precedent for that. It wasn&#39;t the
first time they had bombed a hospital in
Gaza. They bombed them before, but now
they just upped the ante and bombed it
on live television. You see this stuff
play out over and over and over again.
It&#39;s too weird to not notice. And that
doesn&#39;t mean you have to like jump to
the conclusion of like, you know, you
have to hate Jewish people or something
like that. I&#39;m not advocating anything
like that. But you do kind of have to
question the relationship between DC and
Tel Aviv and like what is going on here
because this is so utterly bizarre. You
know, it&#39;s so crazy to see like the the
American people are against what Israel
is doing to Gaza. It obviously hurts
America&#39;s it hurts our uh as the they
use in the preamble to the Constitution.
I like that that phrase domestic
tranquility, right? This is destroying
our domestic tranquility. We got
protests. We got people fighting over
this stuff. We&#39;re pissing off the Muslim
world again, which we&#39;ve already had to
deal with them hating our guts. Now
we&#39;re deporting students. We&#39;re
deporting stu legal residents because
they had the wrong opinion. This is all
and like it&#39;s impossible to not look at
this and go like, &#34;Hey, what&#39;s going on
here?&#34; And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, I it&#39;s just such a perverted
relationship. And the US, the benefactor
that gives all the money to Israel, $4
billion a year, but last year it was 20
billion. It might be 20 billion again
just because of October 7th. For some
reason, that means you have to give
Israel five times more money. While
Americans struggle here domestically,
people don&#39;t ignore this. People
watching this know and it&#39;s just so odd.
It&#39;s forcing people to think about
issues and US foreign policy in a way
they never have before. And that&#39;s why
this is one of my biggest sources of
hope. It hasn&#39;t panned out or manifested
in political victories for dissident,
anti-Israel dissident like myself and
like Dave, but I think it might
ultimately do that. Like he said, you
can&#39;t put the genie back in the bottle.
and they don&#39;t have any answer for that.
And you know, the other thing too is
that it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
noticed this, but there&#39;s like there&#39;s a
lot of people now trying to jump off of
the sinking ship. You know, a lot of
people who are even like supporters of
Israel who are kind of going like I
think they are going a little too far on
this one and they&#39;re trying because it&#39;s
just you see
you can see the writing on the wall all
over the place, man. Like you&#39;re going
to be you&#39;re going to be looked at this
is going to be the period and it&#39;s not
even like supporting the war in Iraq.
It&#39;s like much worse than that, dude.
Like, you&#39;re just supporting this
destruction of these. They just launched
another offensive on Gaza City the other
day. They&#39;re bombing rubble. Like, it&#39;s
just un it&#39;s it&#39;s biblical levels of
evil. It surely is. Maybe 200,000 people
have died. Israel itself says 62,000
probably on the low end. Plus, there&#39;s
like 150,000 people presumed missing,
the majority of which might be dead.
whistleblower Anthony Aguilar, who
worked at GHF and exposed the starvation
campaign there and the nonsense about
them firing rounds into live crowds of
people stampeding for food. He said that
Gaza City is called the apocalypse zone.
That is atrocious and that is a result
of the US bankrolling this. It&#39;s not
just the US. It&#39;s Netanyahu and his
thirst for greater Israel to expand
Israel&#39;s borders, not only into Gaza by
occupying it officially, but also
expanding the West Bank settlements. So,
this is a perverted crusade that the
Zionists have been fighting for a long
time, and they&#39;ve used October 7th as
the political capital to justify it and
support it to the masses. And you know,
we&#39;re sitting here like even as we&#39;re
having this conversation now. I don&#39;t
like I know like a few I remember like
coming on the podcast like a you know, a
couple years ago and like when this
conflict first started and then when it
would go and it was almost like I was
coming on like like to be like look, let
me present the argument for why we
shouldn&#39;t support what Israel is doing
here and let me like try to like present
the other side of the debate. I feel now
like the debate&#39;s over. I don&#39;t even
think there&#39;s like much of a debate to
be had. I&#39;ll keep doing them if somebody
wants to come debate about the issue.
But what are we talking about here,
dude? South Africa brought a genocide
case to the International Court of
Justice and the International Court of
Justice ruled that what Israel was doing
to Gaza was plausibly a genocide.
21 months ago.
21 months ago, they said this was
plausibly a genocide. And the thing&#39;s
gone on the entire time since then.
They&#39;re lit. There was that huge Herets
piece a couple months ago about um you
know because we&#39;ve seen so many examples
of this, but they had IDF soldiers off
the record and one at least one on the
record saying that they were given
orders to fire live rounds into the
crowds of desperate people trying to get
food who have literally been having
starvation throughout Gaza. Yeah, I
don&#39;t know if you saw this dude. I mean,
I couldn&#39;t I actually like found this
hilarious, but I&#39;m a comedian who has a
real twisted dark sense of humor, but uh
um The Free Press, Barry Weiss&#39;s uh
publication like ran a piece uh like
the starvation
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in Gaza. And one of the examples, I&#39;m
not making this up. Like, you go look at
this. I&#39;m not I mean, I&#39;m very close to
exactly accurate on this. One of the
examples they picked was like a kid who
was starving to death. And their attempt
at debunking it was that actually this
kid had another major issue when an
Israeli bomb cracked his skull.
Yeah, just think about that. Let that
sink in. It wasn&#39;t starvation. It was
being hit by a bomb that did him in. And
that&#39;s supposed to plate any kind of
skepticism toward Israel, any criticism
toward Israel and their war path of
destruction and death and genocide.
Look, it it&#39;s absurd. And Dave&#39;s right.
Harets has been covering critics of
Israel within Israel. Ya Golan, who is
the leader of an opposition party in
Israel, has made it no has put it, you
know, very plainly as can be that
Netanyahu is a war criminal. Dave said
E-hood Barack and E-hood Merritt did
Ehud Ol did in a May article in Heretses
where he said that he can&#39;t defend
Israel from charges of genocide anymore.
He said that it&#39;s a war of devastation.
It&#39;s indiscriminate, limitless, cruel,
and criminal killing of civilians. I&#39;m
reading that on a different screen right
now. But this is the case. Even former
Israeli prime ministers and dissident
within Israel are acknowledging this. So
this is where this is at. This is why,
you know, all going on while American
pro-Zionists are doubling down and
saying, &#34;Nope, there&#39;s nothing to see
here. Isolated incidents. It&#39;s all
propaganda. Hamas, if they gave up their
hostages, the war could end tomorrow.
Even though Hamas has 50 hostages,
they&#39;re willing to give them all up. As
we know from the ceasefire, Netanyahu
violated the ceasefire. And it&#39;s
Netanyahu that has about 3,500
Palestinian hostages.&#34;
So that&#39;s your defense that like yes he
starved to death but it was also you
know with these other complications.
This was the big one where the New York
Times had that big picture of the
starving baby and then they made a big
thing out of being like no but he had
other medical you know problems too. And
then the mother had said well they said
he&#39;s the mother said that the doctors
told her that the reason they had other
medical problems is because she was
malnourished during pregnancy. You know,
it&#39;s like, okay, so that&#39;s so yes,
you&#39;re you are right. Israel defenders,
the kids starving to death are the ones
who have other complications. That&#39;s
always who dies first in famines. I
don&#39;t know what like victory you think
this is. But so since this point, since
the I the International Court of Justice
ruled it was plausibly a genocide. the
21 months up to today. Since then, I
know at least to Ahud Omar and Ahud
Barack, both former prime ministers of
Israel have come out and said Netanyahu
is committing war crimes in Gaza. Now,
they didn&#39;t call it a genocide, but they
called it war crimes. So, that&#39;s where
your debate is at this point.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where are we between genocide and war
crimes? What area in there does this
occupy? But how the how the do you
defend any of that, dude?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. None of it can truly be defended.
And when people try, it&#39;s pathetic when
Americans try to say that all this is
Hamas is doing. Somehow blaming the
entire genocide on Hamas. Yeah. I&#39;m
sorry. October 7th and the killing of
about 1,200 people or so. Some of which,
by the way, might have been killed by
the IDF. At least if you listen to some
of the hostages released saying that
Israel issued the Hannibal directive.
That was essentially an order for IDF
soldiers to shoot as many people as
possible. so that they wouldn&#39;t become
hostages. But anyways, that doesn&#39;t give
Israel unlimited license to conduct a
genocide in Gaza. And where is the
American government in this? Just
looking the other way, doubling down
Trump socialing about how great of a war
hero Netanyahu is. It&#39;s just completely
sickening. And Trump joining a war for
Netanyahu&#39;s sake in Iran, which
completely shelled actual US interests
in negotiating with Iran, which would
have been good. we would have had a new
inspections regime, but now we had this
war and if I&#39;m an Iranian nationalist, I
want us getting a nuke now. That&#39;s where
we&#39;re at. So, this is a sick, you know,
just pathetic, duplicitous,
megalomaniacal campaign of death and
destruction in Gaza. I want no part of
it. Most Americans want no part of it.
If you ask an average American layman on
the street, they care much more about
their family&#39;s well-being, being able to
afford a house, college, or healthcare
or food or fuel. carve out a better
future for themselves in America. Our
liberty is not over in the Middle East
or in Israel or in Gaza. It&#39;s in
America. And domestic concerns are of
the utmost importance compared to these
issues. I only follow these issues
because I&#39;m forced to. This is where my
government is sending my money and
taxpayers in general. They&#39;re sending it
to Ukraine and Israel rather than
allowing us to have our money back
that&#39;s taken through a giant extortion
apparatus. that being the government and
the IRS process. So, that&#39;s where we&#39;re
at. I really appreciate Dave&#39;s words on
this. I think he&#39;s exactly right here.
And you see people on the right even
turning against this. Megan Kelly
recently had Mar Marjorie Taylor Green
on her show and she was very pro- Israel
in that interview, but she dared to ask
Marjorie Taylor Green a few questions
and dared to invite Marjorie Taylor
Green on her program. And what&#39;s
happening to her? She&#39;s talked about how
there&#39;s a massive push back campaign
against her just for platforming
Marjorie Taylor Green is enough just for
asking some questions. Asking questions
is akin to anti-semitism to a lot of
this crowd, right? So, that&#39;s where
we&#39;re at. But you do see people on the
right peeling away from this thing. I
don&#39;t know where we go from here or the
political pressure will be enough to
change things because the Apac lobby
certainly has its influence carved out
in this administration hardcore. It&#39;s
probably the most pro-Israel
administration of all time. But let
let&#39;s hope for a better tomorrow. That&#39;s
all we can do. We need to keep educating
people on this and let the world know
about these atrocities. That&#39;s the only
way. But I do want to hear from you. Do
you agree with Dave Smith down below? Do
you think Americans in general are
jumping ship on this pro-Israel
attitude? And what do you think the
endgame is here? Is this genocide going
to be able to stop? How is it going to
end? Is Israel gonna occupy Gaza? And
that be the end of it? Um, let me know
