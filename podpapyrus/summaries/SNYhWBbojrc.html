intve investigation reveals that Israeli
army used humanitarian aid drops as
deadly traps in dangerous areas to
target starving civilians. Come on.
Do you know how Israel is starving the
people of Palestinia right now? They&#39;ve
been doing it for months and then they
drop aid these aid pallets out of
airplanes with supposedly filled with
food and aid.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Uh but they&#39;re they&#39;re doing that
as a trap because they&#39;re dropping that
food in areas that Palestinians aren&#39;t
supposed to be allowed to go. They&#39;re
called they&#39;re like these uh unsafe
areas, meaning that the military could
just kill them. And so that&#39;s so that&#39;s
what I&#39;m going to show you here in this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I thought they were loading Israeli
pedophiles into the boxes and dropping.
So even the BBC the BBC verify
intve investigation reveals that Israeli
army used humanitarian aid drops as
deadly traps in dangerous areas to
target starving civilians. Come on. It&#39;s
almost as if
it&#39;s almost as if Bill Gates was a
Israeli. That&#39;s what it sounds like.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyway, let&#39;s want to watch here. Here&#39;s
a little bit of it. After widespread
reports of mass starvation in Gaza drew
global condemnation, in late July,
Israel allowed some aid to be delivered
by air. But BBC Verify analysis reveals
these drops have fallen into Israeli
designated dangerous combat zones. And
even when they&#39;re in areas deemed safe,
they can be deadly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So they&#39;re dropping the aid in combat
zones, not in the safe areas that
they&#39;re supposed to be dropping them.
They&#39;re dropping the aid in combat
zones. So then they can they can shoot
kill them when they go to try to get the
aid. But even when they do drop it in
the safe zones, uh it&#39;s not good. That&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s also a combat zone. Let me guess
that you&#39;re going to get shot either
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you&#39;re going to get shot either
way. As part of the aid deliveries,
Israel announced daily pauses in
military operations in other areas.
Video footage shows several boxes of aid
being dropped from planes and crowds of
Palestinians rushing to get to the aid
first. But BBC Verify found 10 separate
occasions where aid has dropped into
danger zones. Those areas are in red and
are where the Israeli military has
explicitly warned people not to enter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So this is the danger zone. They&#39;ve
warned Palestinians not to enter the
danger zone or you&#39;ll be immediately
killed. And that&#39;s where they&#39;re
dropping the aid.
That&#39;s where they&#39;re dropping the aid,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; saying it would put their lives at risk.
The BBC&#39;s Jeremy Bowen was inside a
Jordanian plane during one of these
airdrops which are coordinated with
Israel. We&#39;ve matched this view out of
the hatch with existing satellite
imagery to around a kilometer within the
dangerous combat zone. For example, this
is the flight path of one plane of an
airdrop conducted by Italy. And this is
where it released the boxes of aid. Now,
in some cases, we can&#39;t see precisely
where they land, but because of where
they&#39;re dropped and the direction planes
are traveling in, we know that they&#39;re
descending over the dangerous combat
zone. The International Committee of the
Red Cross told us airdrops are
inefficient, unsustainable, and can only
supply limited quantities of items in a
way that often doesn&#39;t reach the most
vulnerable people. The Israeli military
previously said it had no comment on
this matter. And even when aid does fall
into areas deemed safe by the Israeli
military, BBC Verify found that they&#39;ve
been lethal. This video shows the moment
an aid box falls on top of a boy,
crushing him to death. We&#39;ve paused the
footage before it occurred. People had
been rushing towards the boxes of aid
falling from the sky in central Gaza. In
the chaos, Muhammad Aid was trapped.
Graphic video shows him motionless and
bloodied being carried from the scene.
Just a day earlier, verified video
emerged showing a roof collapsing in
Gaza City with Palestinians on and under
it as they try to retrieve aid from an
airdrop which had snagged on a building.
More than a 100 human rights
organizations have called on Israel to
stop the weaponization of aid into Gaza
as starvation deepens. However, is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there the weaponization of aid?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So they starve the people and then they
use the aid as another way to kill them.
And a lot of times the aid package just
drops right on top of people right on
top of their refugee tents and smashes
them. Bet
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; denies there are restrictions on aid and
says at trucks and airdrops continue.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So
they&#39;re just everything they do is is
destruction and death. Everything.
so here Middle East Observer tweets out
airdropping aid into Gaza costly
theatrical performance sometimes deadly.
International and UN agencies have
described the operations of airdropping
food aid into Gaza Strip as costly,
ineffective, and failing to meet the
minimum needs of the population.
considering that they do not contribute
to alleviating the famine ravaging tens
of thousands of besieged civilians, but
may actually pose a deadly threat to
those pursuing them. In a visual
documentary report, Palis Palestinian
photographer Mahmud al-Si documented the
journey of death for food that tens of
thousands of Gaza residents undertake
daily in a perilous attempt to reach aid
distribution points. So, uh,
even when they pretend to do something
good, it goes bad. Zionists are they&#39;re
like a curb your enthusiasm episode if
it were produced by uh, Bloomhouse.
Here, let&#39;s let&#39;s watch this.
I don&#39;t know if you saw that, but it
fell right on a tent.
[Applause]
watch the c it&#39;s just it&#39;s and the news
will defend it by saying ah children
always die in wars. Yeah. Especially
when you&#39;re aiming at them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. This is the tragedy of war. This
is the tragedy of war.
So, uh
it it it it is tragic. I mean,
I just can&#39;t believe this that the rest
of the world is allowing this to happen
I can&#39;t I just it and it&#39;s all
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I believe it. I believe it. They Yeah.
They put a boweapon in everybody&#39;s kids.
Everybody did. They&#39;re not going to want
to talk about it. Everybody&#39;s just dumb
cow. It&#39;s just going to go on like that
forever. just enjoy it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They made you take a boweapon or you
couldn&#39;t go to work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t know. Look for disclosure
or something stupid, you know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And all all the people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
