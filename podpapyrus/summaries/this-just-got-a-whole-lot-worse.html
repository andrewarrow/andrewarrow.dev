Footage shows a group of men scaling
ladders to hang the Union Jack and St.
George&#39;s flags.
In the UK, a new elite police squad has
been introduced to protect migrants and
not all to manage and control your
thoughts and manipulate reality.
Hello there, you awakening wonders. As
you know in the UK, we care about
nothing except vulnerable people. Got to
protect them. Are you okay? Are you
vulnerable? Vulnerable people is all
people. We&#39;re all going to die. Even if
you&#39;ve adorned yourself in the apperties
of power and glory, soon you will be
dead. And it makes you wonder why people
aren&#39;t more willing to connect with
eternal values instead of constructing
new elite police squads to monitor
online spaces and criminalize everyone.
It&#39;s because there&#39;s some sort of
dreadful satanic plot of foot to
globalize and centralize power and
reduce us all to the status of like
drones tortured by demons for all
eternity. But that&#39;s just what I think.
Let me know what you think in the
comments in chat. This story is pretty
amazing. The issue of migration in the
UK is causing so much division and so
much despair. And I wonder as a
Christian how we manage the compassion
that is demanded for all people and
required of us as servants of God to
love one another and the obvious fact
that people in the UK just sick and
tired of having their culture dismantled
and the sense that their culture and
their country is being flooded by people
who don&#39;t agree with it or like it.
While I maintain that migrants are
obviously by the, you know, obvious fact
that they&#39;re sort of broken people and
desperate at the lower end of the scale
when it comes to who is controlling the
head of the serpent. If people don&#39;t
want migrants, they shouldn&#39;t have to
have migrants. Not in a democracy, not
in a democracy. So, let&#39;s have a look at
how this story is unfolding in the UK
and how it&#39;s being used to legitimize
the introduction of new power. Michael
Shelonburgger is talking about it. He&#39;s
a brilliant journalist. It&#39;s always good
to get his insights on the maneuvering
of the deep state. Let&#39;s talk about the
issue of migration in the UK and why
it&#39;s causing so much despair.
Rain has really dampened things down.
Until a short time ago, there were
hundreds and hundreds of people here
protesting outside the Brook Hotel.
We&#39;re on the outskirts of Norwich.
I mean, that tells you everything you
need to know about England. Actually,
it&#39;s quite an important issue, but it is
raining, so people have just sort of
gone home and forgotten about it.
Very much against the fact that asylum
seekers are being put up inside that
hotel. Then on the other side of the
road, on the other side of the
roundabout, was a group of people uh
very much in support of those people
who&#39;ve come to this country. Many of
them on small boats. They actually left
already. That was a a planned ending at
3:15 before uh the rain uh really began.
But actually it had been going pretty
peacefully. They were separated by the
main road until uh according to reports
someone from those supporting those
inside the hotel crossed the road. They
had their face apparently covered in a
balaclava and that caused an enormous
surge of fury with the protesters on
this side pushing against the police
shouting, swearing, and then there was a
surge maybe 100 meters or so up the road
and it appeared that someone was going
to be arrested and that possibly a
decision was made uh not uh to do that.
Since then, we&#39;ve heard people coming
past beeping their horns in support. You
can hear that now.
All of Britain looks like this now. Like
police in hies, bloss hanging out, St.
George&#39;s flags, pro Palestine, pro-
England, pro something. Either way,
Britain is in disarray. On the left, new
political parties being formed. On the
right, new political parties are being
formed and new alliances are blessedly
emerging. But at the level of the actual
government, the current government, the
deep state, powers are being introduced
to control people, whether it&#39;s the use
of facial recognition technology, new
censorship laws, anti-protest laws,
people being arrested and even
imprisoned for free speech issues.
England seems to be in real despair.
Perhaps most concerning is the
introduction of this elite police squad
to monitor anti-migrant posts on social
media. Now, do you believe that the
state has a vested interest in
protecting migrants? Do you think that&#39;s
what this is really about? That, you
know, K star and the MI5 and permanent
global interests and the deep rooted
establishment of Britain are talking
about what are we going to do to protect
migrants. I&#39;d actually find it
heartening and delightful if that was
their interest. If if Vet Cooper and
members of the government were genuinely
concerned about migration, at least that
would be something genuine. But it isn&#39;t
that. You know it&#39;s not that and I know
it&#39;s not that. So what is it? Well, we
can see it was they want to introduce
anti-migrant policing. What they want to
do is create categories of
criminalization everywhere. Whe it&#39;s
around speech, behavior, the past,
anything so that they can control
whoever they need to control and
therefore maintain authority in a
country that would otherwise reject
them. Here&#39;s Michael Shelonburgger on
the same subject. It&#39;s official. The UK
is now officially a police state. It&#39;s
become precisely what Orwell warned
about. Criticize mass migration. You can
expect the police to come to your home
and judges will give longer sentences
for wrong think than for many violent
crimes. Here&#39;s the Telegraph on this
story. An elite team of police officers
is to monitor social media for
anti-migrant sentiments amid fears of
summer riots. Detectives will be drawn
from forces across the country to take
part in a new investigations unit that
will flag up early signs of potential
civil unrest. The division assembled by
the home office will aim to maximize
social media intelligence gathering
after police forces were criticized over
their response to last year&#39;s rise. It
comes amid growing concerns that Britain
is facing another summer of disorder as
protests outside asylum hotels spread.
The government have stopped pretending
to fix Britain and have started trying
to mute it. This is a prime minister
who&#39;s happy to turn Britain into a
surveillance state, but won&#39;t deport
foreign criminals, won&#39;t patrol high
streets, and won&#39;t fund frontline
policing. Labor is scared of the public.
Labour don&#39;t trust the public. Blab
don&#39;t even know the public. Nigel
Farage, the UK reform leader, said it
follows criticism of the authorities
over what some regard as a heavy-handed
approach to social media, including a
judge&#39;s decision to jail Lucy Connelly,
a mother of one who&#39;s married to a
conservative counselor for 31 months
over an inflammatory post in the wake of
Southport attacks. Plans for the new
investigation unit emerged in a letter
to MPs by Dame Diana Johnson, the
policing minister, which was published
just before recess. She wrote, &#34;This
team will provide a national capability
to monosocial media intelligence and
advise on its use to inform local
operational decision-making. This will
be a dedicated function at a national
level for exploiting internet
intelligence to help local forces manage
public safety threats and risks.&#34; While
the UK is plainly being turned into a
police state, whether you&#39;re on the left
or the right, you&#39;re dissatisfied that
at least we can agree upon. People on
the right, patriots are fighting back.
Now, let me know what you think. think
when you see flags being erected, do you
assume these people are racist? Do you
think that they should be maligned? Have
you been pre-bunked to think of anyone
that&#39;s patriotic as a default racist?
And in fact, if people are racist in a
democracy, shouldn&#39;t they be able to
have their racist nation? Let me know
what you think in the comments in chat.
And let&#39;s have a look at these flag
protests that sweeping across the UK.
This is the moment a gang of masked men
hung St. George&#39;s flags in Canary War.
When you say a gang of masked men, the
implication is that they are somehow
terrorists and miscreants for doing it.
But they&#39;re of course masked because
they know that they&#39;ll get arrested. In
a way, what authority should be able to
stop people from flying a flag in their
country? Remember when it was convenient
for people to die under that flag? The
very same interests and institutions
happily afforded it. Think of the number
of coffins draped in that flag from
young conscripted men fighting in
foreign wars. Now when the very same
young men or at least demographically I
would assume same young men start to put
those flags up in their hometowns they
are vilified. That&#39;s in Canning Town
pretty near where I&#39;m from. Certainly
it&#39;s near where my beloved West Ham
United play football. Is that what you
want to call what West Ham do these
days? Anyway, for me watching these
protests is heartening. Even though I do
agree that we would like a varied and
inclusive society, I know there&#39;s no way
of achieving that as long as centralized
authority, both state and corporate,
maintain the kind of control they have
over British political, social, and
cultural life. I.e., we need revolution.
Amid a row over councils, tearing them
down. Footage shows a group of men
scaling ladders to hang the Union Jack
and St. George&#39;s flags. Even the use of
the word scaling rather than climbing is
an indicator that they&#39;re attempting to
purge the actions. See the uh watermark
in the corner? That&#39;s the Sun newspaper.
The Sun newspaper has as its key
demographic young workingclass people.
Maybe not even young, just workingclass
people. And yet that&#39;s the very
demographic that are most punished and
misinformed by that very same
instrument. The Sun newspaper detests
British workingclass people. It is the
play thing of a billionaire, a member of
the class of people, the cast of people
that require that British people remain
enslaved and stupid and ignorant. You
want to know what the macro change is?
The macro change, you already know it.
They are on the precipice of resolving
through AI and robotics the requirement
for a surf class, peasant class,
industrial labor class, whatever you
want to call it. They don&#39;t need that no
more. So what they want is you addicted
to drugs, addicted to bad food, and dumb
and stupid and preferably killing one
another. As long once they&#39;ve got that,
they can legitimize controlling you,
jailing you, criminalizing you. We&#39;ve
been taught our whole lives to hate
people that like that flag. I know
because curiously enough, I&#39;m from that
class of people. Grew out of it through
celebrity. And now I&#39;m once again kind
of fascinated by the values of British
people because well I am one and I love
them. Rumble Premium is a beautiful way

It comes as residents have hit out at
Tower Hamlet&#39;s Council in East London
after it announced the patriotic
displays would be removed. Earlier this
week, similar footage showed Union Jack
and St. George&#39;s flags raised by locals
as part of a movement online called
Operation Raise the Colors. But mayor of
Tower Hamlet, Lefar Raman, who was found
guilty of electoral fraud in 2015, has
thwarted the campaign. However, Siriama
says he quote absolutely supports people
putting up the English flags. Tahham&#39;s
council previously sparked controversy
when they allowed Palestinian flags to
be raised after the war in Gaza broke
out in 2023.
They were eventually removed last year
after members of the local Jewish
community reported they found them quote
oppressive and intimidating. It comes as
tensions across the country continue to
rise with hundreds of protesters
gathering in the capital earlier this
When you&#39;re a member of the
institutional class that run a country
like the United Kingdom, you have two
options. Either you can serve people and
ensure that they&#39;re satisfied because
you&#39;re doing a good job of running a
country or you can legitimize increasing
authority so that their dissatisfaction
and disobedience becomes criminalized
and is already regarded as a problem. If
you are British, you have to love the
British people. If you love the British
people, you want them to be free. You
want them to fly their flags, run their
communities, grow their own food, eat
healthfully, love one another, watch the
football, tolerate and embrace in fact
migration to a sensible degree, and have
the ability to put on the end of a stiff
jab, corporate, commercial interest,
government corruption, and control. But
that&#39;s just what I think. Let me know
what you think in the comments and chat.
And does it seem increasingly likely
that revolution will come not from the
left, but from the populist right? And
with the correct Christian values, this
could be the very thing that restores
Britain to the type of values that we
have always celebrated. Well, I think
you know what I think. Let me know what
you think in the comments and chat.

these days. In the meantime, if you can
stay free, thanks for watching the
video. Have a look at this one over here

Thursday on Rumble.
