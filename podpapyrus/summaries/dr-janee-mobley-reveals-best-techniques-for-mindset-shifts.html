Welcome to Hindsight, the podcast where
bold stories and honest reflections meet
real growth. I&#39;m Lee Jones, your host,
and every week I sit down with
incredible people who turn life&#39;s
turning points into powerful
transformations. And if you&#39;re
navigating change or chasing purpose,
then you&#39;re in the right place. Hey,
good morning though. How you doing?
I&#39;m well. How are you
doing? Pretty good. Thank you so much
for coming on the show.
Thank you for having me on your show.
Yeah, absolutely. What do we got in the
background there?
Um, oh, this is my board. This is
something that, and although it&#39;s messy,
it&#39;s something that reminds me a lot of
my position and my mission. Um, the
scripture tells us that faith without
works is dead. And God literally gave me
the equation that faith the the
scripture shows us that faith minus work
equals dead. So inverse of that faith
plus work, your belief plus your efforts
plus your action plus your
implementation breeds life to whatever
it is you&#39;re working on. So if you
believe in your business, if you do the
work right, you can&#39;t you can&#39;t only
expect it&#39;s going to happen that life is
breathed into your business, into your
marriage, into your relationships, into
your career. So, it&#39;s something that I
always keep up here to remind me to
always stay focused. So,
I definitely asked because I was I was
on this uh I guess you would say
professional development and and one of
the things that the guy said was get you
a dry erase board.
Uh I love driving,
you know, and he said it for a specific
reason. and you have it for your
specific reason, but the thing is, I
guess it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a way to one
visualize, you know, have things up
there and then you can kind of go
through your mind and write stuff down
and erase it and put it up there and get
it going. I like it.
Thanks. Thanks.
It&#39;s just one of those things that came
to me and has stayed up there because I
was like, I need to put it somewhere,
but it&#39;s gonna stay until I figure out
where I&#39;m gonna put it.
I got a final I guess I could put it on
that wall, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to
reach it. You can&#39;t see obviously, but
Hey, so this is hindsight the podcast.
But the reason why I want to start here
is because
we can talk about what it is that you do
and how great you are at doing it,
right? But it is hindsight. So we want
to look at some of those things that
happened to you, you know, in the past
or not really things that happened to
you, but decision points, you know,
places where you had to make a choice.
Either this or that. maybe a place where
you were struggling with something and
how you overcame it. Um, and then we&#39;ll
talk about how great you are as well.
But we want to look at our our yester
you from the perspective of our current
with a hope of charting a journey that
our future self will be proud that you
went on that journey.
You know what I mean?
So that that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of it.
Sometimes I forget the whole purpose and
I get so invested in what it is that you
do. I&#39;m like, that&#39;s amazing. Right. But
I do I do want to definitely stay within
the core of the show. Um and you know,
so just keep that in mind when I ask you
some questions. All right, that&#39;s all.
All right. So, you ready to get going? I
appreciate it. No, it&#39;s it&#39;s just nice
having having amazing people like
yourself come on the show and and share
your experiences, share your you know,
hindsight, your historical moments,
right? the things that make you who you
are today. Um, and the blessing is, you
know, we learn a lot of things. We all
Sometimes we don&#39;t apply it, right? But
the purpose I believe that we&#39;re all on
this planet together is to to learn from
each other, to grow with each other, and
to prosper, right? So that&#39;s that&#39;s how
I see it. We obviously don&#39;t do that a
lot of times, but I got to believe.
Right. So,
absolutely.
All right. So, let&#39;s get to it. Oh, I
got a It&#39;s a little cold out here in
California. I&#39;m sniffling. Yeah, it&#39;s
been a little chilly. I&#39;m not going to
complain because I&#39;m I&#39;m actually in a
desert-like area
and in a few months it&#39;s going to be
like 100 degrees plus for like a month.
Embracing this stint of coolness right
Yeah, exactly. I just got a little
sinusy going on right now. But but uh
you know I&#39;ll take this today cuz in a
few months it&#39;s going to be uh Yeah.
Oh yeah.
All right. So here we go.
When you look back in hind
everything
make mistakes we&#39;re learning from
Your tomorrow
is so much clearer now.
What if everything you needed to succeed
was already inside you, but you were
unknowingly blocking it? Well, doctor.
All right, here we go. We&#39;re going to
stop right here.
How do I pray?
We&#39;re gonna stop right here
because I need to know how to say your
name properly. That was should have been
my first question
and you know it. That&#39;s why you
All right, let me try first.
Okay, let&#39;s
because you know I&#39;m I&#39;m going to do
French just because the thing is at the
end Jani Jani Jani
you got it right you say nay but you
I get it wrong more than I get it right
so I&#39;m happy today we we going in the
so Janique is absolutely perfect and
Mobly is the last
Mobly I would have got that wrong. So,
I&#39;m glad you said that. Okay.
Dr. Janie Mobly is a transformational
speaker, certified life coach, and the
author of 40 Days to the Better You. Oh,
this is amazing.
Okay. Okay. And I I&#39;ll tell you why.
I&#39;ll tell you why this is amazing. Huh?
What&#39;s that?
I&#39;m enjoying this already. I love how
you pause. I love this.
Let&#39;s Let&#39;s go
because I&#39;m in the moment. like I don&#39;t
want it to be, you know, all robotic and
and this is what, you know, I&#39;m in the
moment. So when I see stuff, I&#39;m like,
&#34;Oh, 40 day.&#34; And I and I&#39;ll tell you
why. Cuz I&#39;m in the process of writing
one. And and it&#39;s
it&#39;s about it&#39;s it&#39;s like
it&#39;s not 40 days to a better you, but
it&#39;s it&#39;s 30 days to get to know you.
And that&#39;s not the that&#39;s not the the
title, but it&#39;s basically you you feel
what I&#39;m saying?
Yeah. All right. All right. We&#39;ll get
into maybe we won&#39;t, but we may talk
about it.
She&#39;s the founder of Success and Wealth
Institute where she empowers
purpose-driven people to overcome
internal obstacles and rebuild a life of
prosperity. And in this episode,
hopefully we&#39;ll explore the power of
faith. No, we definitely will do that.
Identity and what it truly takes to
overcome self- sabotage and walk boldly
in your purpose. Good morning. Where are
you calling in from, Dr. Janine?
In Albany, Georgia.
yes. So, to your far west.
Yeah, I&#39;m all the way to the end of the
West. I&#39;m right on the right on the
shorelines. No.
So, uh, so how is it out in Albany,
It&#39;s It&#39;s warming up. It actually It&#39;s
going to be probably 89 degrees today,
probably. Now, that&#39;s the that that&#39;s
the kicker. So, I talked about how cold
it is, but what happens typically and
and the clouds are not out is that it&#39;s
cold in the morning because it&#39;s in a
desert-like area. So, it&#39;s cold in the
morning. I&#39;ve walked my dog. I&#39;ve gone
out in the morning, walk my dog, it&#39;s 37
degrees and in the afternoon it&#39;s 87
like that flux. And that&#39;s how you get
sick, you know, if you&#39;re not prepared.
I&#39;ve been here for a while so I kind of
get it. But
crazy still.
Sounds right. Still, I saw this one
graphic. Someone had a I don&#39;t know what
to wear and it was a, you know,
Californians and they had all these
coats and layers and stuff and trying to
take it off because the temperatures
just fluctuate so rapidly throughout the
day. Yeah, it&#39;s fun though. I love Where
is Albany, Georgia? Is that north,
southsou, east, west?
Southwest Georgia.
South. Okay. Okay. Where&#39;s the base at?
Um Marine base or air force?
Marine base because there&#39;s
one in an army base.
maybe not.
There is one in Columbus, Georgia.
Columbus. There you go. Is that Is that
Yes. That&#39;s like maybe an hour away.
Oh, yeah. That&#39;s close enough.
I like I like Georgia.
Um, I like it a lot to be honest with
you. And, you know, keeping it keeping
it above. I remember going to this um
it&#39;s called the
Nick, no.
It&#39;s a sales conference, but it&#39;s really
for like African-American,
black, black and brown people
and it was in Georgia and I was so
felt good to be there.
Ah, understood.
It felt good to be there cuz I&#39;m in
California. It&#39;s really diverse and it&#39;s
cool. Like I like everywhere I&#39;m at. But
when I was there, you know, you see so
many black and brown people together,
common purpose, trying to be better, you
know, trying to prosper and and and you
know, no conflict, you know, what the
media puts out there is always some sort
of incident. It was just a good moment.
So, I have fond feelings for Georgia,
but at the same time, I don&#39;t want to
live there. No,
that&#39;s just me.
planes. That&#39;s why
That&#39;s why what?
That&#39;s why you That&#39;s why they have
planes and you can fly anywhere you
Yeah. Yeah. I think that&#39;s why I don&#39;t
like it because of the airport.
That stupid
um I I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been stuck there a couple
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah. It&#39;s It&#39;s big airport.
That&#39;s totally fine.
Yeah. All right. So, let&#39;s let&#39;s start.
I said a word in the introduction.
s self-sabotage.
So, let&#39;s just start at the core. And
what does self- sabotage look like? And
why is it often so hard to recognize in
ourselves? I&#39;m we jumping right into it.
All right.
All right. So, sabotage, let&#39;s look at
sabotage by itself. So, to sabotage
anything means to destroy something. It
means to take something that may have
been great, something that may have been
good and in some ways discredit it, in
some ways destroy it, in some ways tear
it up, right? To take something that was
great and make it horrible, right? So
when we look at self, we look at the
individual.
So when a self, a person sabotages
themselves, they destroy themselves,
right? They discredit themselves. They
put themselves down. They always look at
all of the mistakes that they&#39;ve made
instead of the positive decisions that
they&#39;ve made. Right?
They ridicule themselves more than
others do in spite and despite the fact
that they highlight more of what other
people have said about them more than
what they have said about themselves.
Right? Self-sabotage is more internal
than it is external.
And the sad thing is when people look at
the a lot of people, not all people, but
a lot of people when they look at
themselves and look within themselves,
they see more of the negative than they
do all of the positive.
Does that make sense?
It makes a lot of sense. It make it
makes great sense. And you know for
I I you know I can&#39;t speak for anybody.
So for me
you try to I try to
be you know seek out perfection.
It&#39;s not saying that I&#39;m a
perfectionist. It&#39;s just that you kind
of have an idea of what the perfect
whatever it is looks like. At least in
your head, right? Your vision of what
that looks like. and you strive for it
and you live within yourself so you
understand all of the things that go
wrong and you focus I believe I focus on
things that go wrong probably a little
more heavily than I should
a lot of
yeah you know what I mean and you know
even even at my work so we have
customers that work and all we hear are
what&#39;s going wrong but then you look at
it and probably about 969 97% of the
things are going right.
But you hear about the wrong and I think
it&#39;s just natural, you know, in in human
dynamic. What what do you think about
to focus on that negative.
There&#39;s here&#39;s the thing. A lot of it is
foundational.
So when we think about going back to
being a child and I understand this is
parenting because when I parent our
children, I try to pivot that. So when
you are a child, what happens? You do
something great and it&#39;s like, &#34;Yay, you
did something great and then you do
something that&#39;s not so great.&#34; And it&#39;s
and there&#39;s a huge deal about what was
not so great more than there was about
everything that you did was good. So
foundationally the foundation that you
stand upon as a child has been more
pointing out all of the negatives and
the great that you didn&#39;t do that you
did do and minimalizing
all of the amazing things that you did.
Right? So then what happens? You grow
up. you get older with that same
standing on that same foundation and you
use that same mindset, that same
mentality because you&#39;re still standing
on that same foundation and you use it
in every area of your life. So, I
graduated from high school. Oh, okay.
Yeah, great. That was awesome. Okay, I
get a little celebration.
Oh, I graduate from college. Oh, yeah.
That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to
do, right? Oh, I get a job or I start a
business. Oh, yeah. That&#39;s, you know,
great. And then what happens? you fail,
you don&#39;t pass a class, the customers
don&#39;t come in as as quickly and it&#39;s
like, oh my gosh, it&#39;s so devastating.
Oh my god. And then of course because of
the foundation that you stand upon, what
lingers and what you hear more of and
what you focus more of is all on the
negatives because that has what has been
ingrained in you. to balloon all of the
negatives and only minimize
or minimally celebrate the positives. So
while it has been natural, it&#39;s not the
way that it&#39;s supposed to be.
The sad thing is that we have we there
is a world that has been built upon the
same thing. Even when you think about
what they call the negative news, right?
There&#39;s so many amazing things and so
many people out here doing amazing
things, but because of the mindsets of
people, people get engulfed in the
drama, they get engulfed in all of the
negative, right? Because there&#39;s a world
that has stood on a foundation of
highlighting everything negative instead
of everything positive. So what people
one thing that I have learned to shift
my mindset and even coming down to
parenting and even in my marriage I
highlight and I celebrate the great
like on a whole great level right even
for myself I always celebrate any
accomplishment that I&#39;ve had this being
on your show is a celebration to me
right why here&#39;s my perception
hindsight is your baby how do I know
that this is your baby. You take pride
in it. You have branded it. You have a
t-shirt that has hindsight on it. You
have a sign behind you that has
hindsight on it. You take your show
seriously. You&#39;ve invested in the
platform, right, that is that is
building your brand. So, you&#39;re not just
going to bring anybody on here. That&#39;s
my mindset. So, I celebrate the fact
that you have opened up something that
is personal to you and has and has
invited me in. Right. I celebrate that.
I don&#39;t minimize that. This is an
amazing opportunity, not only for me,
but for your show to be able to expand
it on an even greater way,
right? And in a greater form.
So, here&#39;s the thing. Everybody may not
say yes, but I&#39;m okay with those places
and those people who say yes that I&#39;m
supposed to go to, and I celebrate that.
So, we have to get into the mindset of
really what I like calling overdoing all
of the positives, all of the
accomplishments. I don&#39;t care if you
made a sale. I don&#39;t care if per one
person bought a book. I don&#39;t care if
one person shared something on social
media. Celebrate that because you have
we have to learn to shift our way of
thinking so that majority that we not
going in a downward spiral.
I like it. And to your point, and if you
don&#39;t mind me saying this, to your
point, as a consumer,
I go I frequent um this place to get
protein shakes. And I I&#39;m one of those
like I realize that people
um complain more than they compliment,
right? So I don&#39;t care like if my shake
is good, I let them know that it&#39;s good.
And I tell her, I said, I tell you that
because I know people complain more than
they compliment. And to your point, as a
business owner, that&#39;s what she says.
People complain a lot,
but you don&#39;t hear all of the
compliments, which is a sad thing,
but a true thing.
Yeah. You know what? I try to live in
that in that spirit as well. I try. I
don&#39;t do it all the time, obviously, but
I just went the other day and
um to to a that&#39;s a whole another story.
So anyway, both our cars like had
problems at the exact same time. I took
my dog out the car, battery wouldn&#39;t
start. So I said, &#34;Hey, I need you to
come pick me up uh in the other car. The
other car battery didn&#39;t start and it
had a tire that needed to be replaced.&#34;
Blah blah blah. So I went to this car
dealership, not car dealership, car uh
service place,
and they were amazing. And you know,
sometimes you go to these to these
stores or these these vendors, these
businesses, and you get okay service,
you get great service. So for me when I
see like great service I tell you I&#39;m
always looking towards perfection not
know knowing that we&#39;re not going to get
there but they were as close to the
perfected experience that I was looking
for that I had to tell them.
You know what I mean?
I had to tell them
because if if they were horrible I&#39;d
have definitely told them
and I&#39; went on YouTube and I&#39;d have told
everybody I could. Right.
So so I feel I feel the same way. You
know when you see professional
employees who are very conscious of the
customer experience. I let them know,
hey, you did a great job. And if I can
find their boss,
oh yeah, I&#39;mma let them know this. This
is a keeper. We may try to we may try to
get this employee into our spot. So,
just keep that in mind.
Um, I think it is important.
It is.
I think it is important.
I think it is important. And I I know
for me and and I&#39;ll shift this just a
little bit
cuz we&#39;re talking about self-sabotage.
Now we&#39;re talking about the mental the
the the foundation of the the negative
versus the positive. Right.
For me understanding that that&#39;s how I
The other the other side of it is I
always look for things
to make it better.
So meaning Oh, go ahead. I&#39;m sorry. No,
I said absolutely. Go ahead.
Yeah. So, meaning like if I have a meet
and I and I always tell my my team,
look, when I say something to you, let&#39;s
try to keep the emotion part of it out.
And I&#39;m going to tell you right now
It&#39;s only to get better. So, when you
hear me say something and it feels
negative to you and you have a, you
know, your natural whatever it is
because of your Thank you for explaining
this to me, your foundational
upbringing, know that it&#39;s not that.
Mhm. know that it&#39;s not that. I have
guys tell me, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t want to tell
you this because I thought I would get
dude, I&#39;m not trying to fire nobody
unless you deserve it.
that&#39;s a mistake.
That wasn&#39;t a willing, you know what I&#39;m
saying? So, I&#39;m trying to even even as I
work on myself,
I try to work on them as well because I
want to tell them what the intent is
of what I&#39;m saying. Go ahead.
That you have as a leader.
Amazing. And I I love that you lead from
that place because you are in a position
to be able to shift other people&#39;s
mindsets about themselves and how they
should lead also.
Makes that a golden opportunity. So I
love that. I love that.
Yeah. And I I you know I got some of
that obviously I was in the army for a
few years 20 plus. And um you know I had
a lot of Thank you. I appreciate I had a
lot of leaders and you learn some good
stuff and some bad stuff
and you know when you get behind the
scenes and you really see the dynamics
of people right especially in leadership
and in following you know in those roles
and you just pay attention to it right
you be like I don&#39;t want to do that oh I
don&#39;t want to come off that way but I
need to come off in strength
but I also need to have compassion and
empathy I need you to see all of it and
understand this is where I&#39;m coming from
right and I I think a lot of people miss
that because they say either I got to be
strong or they&#39;re only focused on
themselves
or you know whatever it is. And we all,
you know, I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t focus
on myself at times. You have to you got
to take care of yourself.
But at the same time, when you&#39;re
dealing with a team,
they got to they got to be all in.
And that&#39;s that that&#39;s that army thing.
Go ahead.
Absolutely. I mean, you have here&#39;s the
thing. One of the things that I&#39;ve
learned about even in times where I
don&#39;t like what people are saying about
me, right? Because we don&#39;t, you know, I
mean, here&#39;s the thing and I&#39;ll just be
honest. I like when I hear the positive
things. However,
the negative G is an opportunity.
Why? It&#39;s a opportunity for me to see
how I can improve myself.
Because if all I hear is that I am the
most amazing person in the world, then
where is the opportunity to improve
So even if I don&#39;t like what it is that
you&#39;re saying, my position and stance is
okay, where is the opportunity for me to
learn? Where&#39;s the opportunity for me to
grow? Where is an opportunity to refine
what I already have to make it better?
Because even for me, one of the areas
constantly working on is my level of
communication and I always say everybody
is not me right so my position and
stance and understanding that people are
not me it puts me in a place a mental
space of always making sure that in my
delivery I&#39;m in a position of making
sure that I explain in a way that people
understand they comprehend and it&#39;s not
offensive and even if it is a
constructive criticism that I position
myself in a way that it is not defensive
even if you are offensive that they
don&#39;t become defensive as much as
Yeah. Yeah. We are kindred spirits. I&#39;m
not I&#39;m I&#39;m not even it&#39;s like I&#39;m
you know how you see the movies and
someone else has took over somebody
else&#39;s body but it&#39;s like all the words
that you&#39;re saying like I&#39;m like man
that sounds familiar.
Yeah. I mean
it&#39;s a thing. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Cuz you can look at uh criticism as just
a criticism. You can look at a failure
as a failure. But I&#39;ve always learned
that I learn most from the areas that I
have been deficient
than in the areas where I have been
efficient. So in hindsight um we can go
into the story. All right. Yeah. We
gonna go right into this story. So in
2012 um my husband and I became
homeless. So I would the doctor part
comes from a doctor at a pharmacy and um
we had a six-f figureure household doing
very very well. And it was literally an
experience where I knew something was
going to happen. Like I just knew I knew
when I when I went to work it just it
just felt off, right? And she fired me.
Fast forward we became homeless, right?
and literally to a place where my
husband and I slept in our Infinity M35
um while I was pregnant with our oldest
son in the middle of night. He stayed
awake just to make sure that nobody
robbed us or tried to kill us while I
could get some sleep. And it was through
that place that I I&#39;ve always been one
that has focused on personal development
because I understand that I can&#39;t lead
others if I can&#39;t meet lead my own ship,
right? That&#39;s in that&#39;s in marriage,
that&#39;s in motherhood, that&#39;s in
business. So one of the way I work
hardest on me than I do anything else
because I understand that I&#39;m at the
core of every area of my life. So if I&#39;m
at my best, my marriage has the
potential to be at its best, right? My
um position as a mother and my
relationship with our children will be
at its best. My finances with everything
will be my business will be at its best
when I am at my best. And I worked
hardest on myself. And I realized that
that was the key in my husband and I
being able to transition from being
homeless to being hopeful and in and
ultimately buying another home. I mean,
buying a home.
And starting all over.
There was so many lessons. You can ask
me whatever you want to about that. But
that hindsight experience that I think
about that I&#39;ve learned so much from.
And although it seemed like a pitfall,
it ended up turning into a pain that
ended up becoming a purpose.
that was my question. That was my next
qu I was vibing with you and we were
talking and that was the question that
was in the queue
on there about that. I&#39;m I&#39;m not even
I&#39;m not even joking.
Hilarious.
Yeah. No, that so I just had to go to
the next one. But I do want to go I do
want to go back in hindsight and I
appreciate you bringing that up.
We all go through stuff and and
that&#39;s an extremity, right? How about
how long were you? Was it just a a few
We slept in a car overnight and we
literally didn&#39;t have a home of our own
that was 2012. Our our son was born um
May 2014. So it was over a year.
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
How did you Okay, this I want I want you
to go into it as as best you can.
You knew it was coming. It felt bad. You
slept in the in in the vehicle. Like,
how did that how were you feeling in
that moment
when it was when it was fresh? Were you
feeling defeated? Were you feeling
ashamed? Like, like what what feelings?
Because you talked about how you came
out, you had purpose and you wanted to
do better, you know, personal
development and things like that,
but when it hit you,
this is happening,
right? What did that feel like in that
It was how it was more of the question
how did I get in this place?
Yeah. Yeah.
And when you ask those cuz I believe you
ask you shall receive. So in asking
those questions it just a swarm of
opportunities that could have prevented
it went through my mind. So, um I think
I went through a place of shame cuz I
had never been homeless before. And then
having a doctorate degree just made it
even more so cuz I&#39;m going like I&#39;m in a
place where I shouldn&#39;t even be in this
place. Like that was literally my
mindset. And I&#39;m like dog like wow. But
one thing about me and this has been my
stance and this is something I continue
to stand on. I can&#39;t complain about
something I&#39;m not willing to change. And
even and I can I literally could see
myself because I&#39;ve been one even before
becoming homeless. I worked hard on
myself. So I realized that I had a
choice. I could stay there and complain
about it and the probability of us
staying there longer would increase or I
could figure out literally this is what
I said to myself and this was 2012. So
fast forward, you know, he&#39;s the
president, but he was one he was someone
that I studied in um in terms of wealth
and money and reading up on the now um
President Donald Trump, I understood
that he filed bankruptcy few times,
right? And I said to myself, I said,
&#34;Okay, clearly I didn&#39;t file
bankruptcy.&#34; Clearly, this was literally
me talking to myself. I was like, &#34;Okay,
Janine, now if he could file bankruptcy
a few times and bounce back surely
this is not bad.&#34; Like you can figure
y&#39;all can figure this out and get out of
this, right? And so I I saw an
opportunity and I literally again trying
to figure out, okay,
he&#39;s no different than me in terms of
just being a person. So, what separate
what separated me from Donald Trump
other than the obvious color? It&#39;s just
And I literally I couldn&#39;t afford to go
buy a book, but I made my way to the
nearest library and got a free library
card and I checked out a book often.
That was my safety net because I knew I
knew where we were physically. And if I
focused on this is not my house or this
is not my environment or I don&#39;t like it
here, it was just going to make me
depressed.
Right? So I said I have to really engulf
myself and create an environment that&#39;s
going to shift my external environment.
So I checked out every book. I checked
out Joyce Meyer. I was checking out TDJ.
I check I checked out every personal
development book. I literally because
you know they give you about what is it
about 10 days to read the book. So I had
like something propelled me. I said okay
let me get done with this book. I went
back and read another book and read
another book and read another book and
read another book and then the funny
thing is I said you know what I was
homeless but I went and volunteered cuz
I&#39;ve always loved empowering people.
So I went and volunteered. These people
didn&#39;t know I was homeless but I went to
go encourage them. And guess what? I was
talking to myself.
They were in the room, but I was
encouraging them. I was encouraging
myself. So to be honest, to answer your
question, because I went on a whole
tangent, but to answer question,
I went from shame to like disappointment
in myself to like figuring out, okay,
no, we ain&#39;t going to stay here.
So to be honest, I mean, look, I felt
the way I felt, but I was determined I
wasn&#39;t going to stay here. Yeah, I like
it. I like it. And you know, because
some things are not, but many things are
just a moment in time.
Absolutely.
And you you&#39;ll weather it, right? But
what you got to do is not wallow in it.
And your example, your story is exactly
what needs to happen. You need to figure
out, okay, and to my point, this is this
is where I&#39;m at.
I don&#39;t want to be here. How do I get
That part
and that&#39;s the hard part at times
because we make it hard,
right? We make it hard because most of
that a good 50% what GI Joe 50% is
knowing. Uh half the battle is is
knowing, right? The other half is doing.
So that mindset shift
has to happen.
Absolutely.
It has to happen. I always say this is
one one thing I always say you could
tell who going to survive
a zombie attack.
They gonna survive the longest, you
know, obviously if you&#39;re not in a major
city cuz then that&#39;s just luck of the
draw. But the ones who can shift their
the quickest because life comes at you
fast. It&#39;s not always going to be like
it is right now. when it hits,
you know, it&#39;s hitting. I I use the term
grit. Get ready. It&#39;s time.
Oh, I like that.
So, you practice. You practice all of
these things. You strengthen. You was
reading books. You were getting
fulfilled with these things. So, when
something happens, get ready. It&#39;s time.
I&#39;m ready mentally to deal with this.
I like that. Yeah. Yeah. It It&#39;s a
constant thing. And that&#39;s what people
don&#39;t re sometimes people really don&#39;t
realize I always say one of the greatest
tricks of the enemy is to isolate people
because if they if you can be isolated
then your whole mindset can be jacked up
for the lack of a better word right
because it
nobody gets to the top by themselves
right you know people say oh they&#39;re
self-made millionaires or no the reality
of it is is that they stand upon the
shoulders of somebody&#39;s wisdom that
poured into them in some capacity
directly or indirectly. Right? You can&#39;t
be successful as a leader in your
business if you don&#39;t have a team of
people to help you to implement the very
idea that you have. We need community.
And the great thing, and I I still um I
don&#39;t work at your place of business,
but I understand that the only way that
you&#39;re going to even the way that you
even continue to maintain a team is that
you pour into your team in some
And the more you pour into them, the
more they&#39;re going to go and do an
amazing work for you, right? Because
they&#39;re doing it for themselves as well.
So we have to surround ourselves with
the right things and the right people so
that we have the strength to stand that
we have the strength to endure that we
have the strength to persevere that we
have the strength to be resilient a lot
of times people strength is misguided
it&#39;s feeling like I can do it by myself
and I can cover my emotions that ain&#39;t
there&#39;s strength in vulnerability and
being honest about where you are
right. There&#39;s strength in acknowledging
that I can&#39;t do this by myself because I
wasn&#39;t equipped to do it by myself.
I&#39;m smiling and and thinking all these
things because I was going to say
something. He said I had a boss, a prior
boss, former boss, and he he would say,
&#34;Don&#39;t drown alone.&#34;
Right? And it kind of touches on that
stuff. Oh, I can I can do it. I can
figure this out. I can make this happen.
Dude, you got a team.
You got a team that you don&#39;t need to be
leaning on them all the time, right? You
need to have your own strength, but at
the same time, don&#39;t drown alone. Don&#39;t
go down with the Ask, raise your
hand. I always tell people, see
something, say something. Feel
something, say something.
Let me know. Let&#39;s go through this
together. You don&#39;t have to figure
everything out on your own.
Absolutely.
So, a part of that, you can&#39;t succeed
without a good team. You know, you can
easily fail
if you isolate yourself. And you talked
about the enemy isolating you. Enemy
doesn&#39;t have to be anything bad. It can
be situations. It can be your own self.
You&#39;re your own worst enemy. You heard
that term before, right? And that
applies in a lot of situations. So, just
pride, ego.
I&#39;m not going to ask because if I ask,
then I&#39;m giving them power. No, you&#39;re
not. You&#39;re giving y&#39;all power.
So, anyho, I&#39;m on a tangent now.
But you say these I I appreciate this
conversation because a lot of the things
they really uh resonate
with things that I experience uh things
that I feel as well and it&#39;s always it&#39;s
a working day to day by day working
your future you and I&#39;m going bring that
back to that as well. Right. All right.
So let&#39;s get off of that one real quick
because now we want to help some people.
I believe I always got to say that many
people feel like they were meant for
more but don&#39;t know how to access it.
What was your awakening moment that
pushed you towards coaching and
transformational speaking?
Oh wow. Um
I&#39;ve always I shared this earlier that
I&#39;ve always been one that has loved to
empower people, encourage people. I was
the friend that people and still am um
that people come to and share certain
things with. Right. And one of the
things that always excites me is
identifying a solution to the problem,
right? Because I just believe that each
and every one of us are solutionist in
our own right and capacity and purpose.
one of the things that
I did, I didn&#39;t even know what a coach
was until I had a friend of mine who
started talking about it and she was
talking about it and I was like, maybe I
need to hire a coach. Maybe I need to
invest in a coach. So that was like the
beginning of the evolution of coach
Janine. So I literally invested in a
coach. And as she was working with me, I
was like, I do the same thing. Like as
she was helping me, cuz she was really
helping me. And I&#39;m sitting here
thinking to myself, I didn&#39;t realize
that people get paid for this. This was
some years ago.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I literally I was
like after after our session was done
and um our time was done, I started to
just kind of pick her brain and I
realized I was like this is me all day
And the speaking ended up becoming a
part of it because I I always love to
speak individually. And the crazy thing
is in high school I was afraid to speak
in front of massive amounts of people.
and podcast really
I&#39;m I&#39;m dead serious. It took it took it
it took some it took some coaching co
coaxing coaxing myself to do the video
because I started off I&#39;m like I want to
do a podcast but I said let me do audio
because because
I want to look good on camera. I don&#39;t
know how to do this. I you know all
these different things that foundational
stuff that you talked about right that
were holding me back and I had so many
people saying hey just do it you know
Nike summed it up perfectly just just do
it you know what what&#39;s the worst that
can happen stop thinking all the
negative we talked about that earlier
what&#39;s the positive that can come from
it okay go ahead
yeah and I&#39;m sure you got a lot of
positives from it right
yeah oh absolutely like this
conversation right here is a positive
for sure
oh Great. So, I actually I went through
the process and um ended up starting and
started and the the perfect thing for me
was working with my first client. And
when I realized the results that I got
from her as a legitimized business owner
and I said, I love this. And the part
that I loved most was the effect that my
gift had.
And I was like, I could do this any day.
Just like even sitting here speaking,
this is I can do this any day. Like I
love this. Love love love it. Podcast
level, stage level. I love podcast cuz
it&#39;s, you know, very very interactional.
But yeah, so it was just me being
exposed to what the opportunity was and
then making a decision from there and
taking action on it.
I like it. You often say you were
created on purpose for a purpose.
How did you come to believe that for
I am a believer at heart and um my
even in growing up as a child I always
you know how like people would like
dream like kids have these huge big
dreams and for me as I got older I still
kept dreaming so it wasn&#39;t like it was
it was something to this thing and even
as I started accomplishing even when I
went to pharmacy school and graduated
from primacy school, I still felt that
there was more. Like there there was
always more. And even through my
relationship with God, I understand that
we&#39;re built for a purpose. Like each and
every one of us. Again, you can&#39;t get to
the top. You can&#39;t ascend alone at all.
Even for those who go mountain climbing
and hiking by themselves, there are
tools and equipment that they must have
in order to maintain their safety. If
nothing else, you got to have the right
shoes. Guess what? Somebody made those
shoes. Somebody had the idea for the
equipment, right? So you can&#39;t we all
need each other, right? And that means
each and every one of us have something
and are equipped to do something that
the other person has not been able and
equipped to do. So that helps me to
understand that we were all built for a
purpose to contribute to each other and
also to contribute to this earth and our
own efforts in with an effort to elevate
each other.
I got a funny story. It&#39;s not even a
It&#39;s not even a story. You talk about
dream when you was young. When I was
young, I had dreams of being a wide
receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
And then I remember like because I was
pretty okay, you know, playing football.
But I remember one day and we used to
play because I&#39;m I&#39;m from Maryland,
Baltimore. We used to play, you know, no
tackle football, no equipment, all this
stuff during the summertime
and the guy, he threw this beautiful
pass and I was going out to catch it.
But what I did was I looked up and I saw
the ball and then I looked this way and
I saw the defender coming right at me. I
look back at the ball and I said, &#34;This
is going to be close.&#34;
And I looked back at the defender and I
said, &#34;Yeah, this is going to be close.&#34;
And I said, &#34;All right, if I&#39;m going to
be a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh
Steelers and I got to just focus on this
ball, put this out of my head, you know,
this guy that&#39;s barreling down on me and
catch this ball and, you know, be
successful. I got to put all of this all
this out of my head.&#34; So, I stopped
looking at this guy
and I just focused on the ball. And I
tell you what, Janique, as soon as that
football hit my fingertips, this guy lit
me up
because he had a job. He had
your purpose was to catch that ball and
his purpose was to keep you from running
the end zone.
It hit the tip of my fingertips and next
thing I know, the back my back the back
of my neck was hitting the goddamn
ground. So anyway, I didn&#39;t become a
Pittsburgh, still a wide receiver. But I
learned that day that I could focus on
what my job was. He just did his a
little better. So yeah, and I still
dream. I still dream, you know, of of
getting books and stuff like that. And I
think just, you know, keeping that
creativity, not not getting complacent,
not believing that this is reality, you
know, this moment is all there is,
right? Not getting stuck in the past. I
know this is called hindsight, but the
whole purpose of hindsight is to look at
the past, see where you are based on
your past choices and past decisions.
Are you where you want to be right now?
Oh no. Oh yes, whatever. Let&#39;s continue
to make these type of choices or let&#39;s
shift our mindset so that we can get to
where we want to go. So that&#39;s the whole
point of my uh hindsight. People always
say, &#34;Well, you can&#39;t live in the past.&#34;
Yeah, but you can learn. You can learn
from the past, you know, and and your
future self hopefully will thank you for
you taking the time out to figure out
who you are, looking at your past
decisions, looking at these things, and
then creating a path for you to get to
in the future. So, I love it. I was when
I was young, I I really felt, you know,
like there was more, like I should be
doing more. And I think everyone I think
it&#39;s kind of common. And I was like, am
I supposed to be a preacher? You know,
because I I you well talk about him. But
anyway, my stepdad at the time was a
preacher. We were in church a lot. You
look at the respect that you get from
the congregation, from preachers and
stuff like that. And I knew I had
thoughts, I had feelings, I had things
that I wanted to share, but I was shy. I
told you that a little bit without
saying it. I was shy. So, I alluded that
maybe that was my purpose. I don&#39;t think
so. But
potentially
with all of that I just said
like right now I joined the army.
I got out transition now I work in
corporate or whatever you want to call
All based on faith. Not always a great
faith guy. But now I want to shift all
of my
highlights, failures condensed to you.
Okay. How was how has your faith
shaped not only your journey, your
personal journey? And now let&#39;s get into
what you&#39;re doing right now, but also
the way you coach and lead others. You
talked about your kids, talked about
some of your clients. How has your faith
helped that journey
and then what is that you&#39;re doing
Um my faith has shaped it.
Um and when I say shape it, it is
the words that help form my ability to
be my h to be Janine the woman.
Um Janine the daughter, the Janine wife,
Janine mom, Janine entrepreneur and
coach to women and it&#39;s literally the
position and the foundation as to which
I stand on and am rooted in. So what
does that mean? So when I look at a
plant, when a seed is planted into the
ground, the very expectation of the seed
that has been planted is actually the
one that will end up producing and
So and every and that plant has been
based upon the seed that was sown.
So the seed of the word of God
is always something that I keep in mind
that everything that I produce should
the be the be result of how I treat
myself, how I treat people. It all
should be rooted from that seed,
right? It is in the way that I operate.
Now is it perfection? No. Because I
understand that I can&#39;t be perfect
myself. But I strive for for progress. I
remember at the beginning you were
talking about perfection. And one of the
things that I know that stops a lot of
people is that they&#39;re always seeking
perfection. Now, I believe we should
have a goal and a focus. But your goal
should not be perfection. It should be
progress. Because if you&#39;re always
seeking to be perfect without the
understanding that you need progress,
when you fall short, you&#39;re going to
self-sabotage nine times out of 10.
Right? And that is because I know and I
can say that because I understand that
the seed of the word of God in me
reminds me that I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s
going to perfect Janine. God is. And if
I and that is only if I stay rooted in
I love it.
Thank you.
I love it.
I love it because I see my you know
obviously we talked about this earlier
as well. We keep saying it&#39;s hindsight
so we can keep saying we talked about
this earlier. Um how you cuz I do the
same thing. I I look you talk I think
specifically you were talking about
communication and how were you effective
in that communication at the time and I
always I try to look I try to look and
see where I can get better.
Absolutely
right. And it&#39;s not anything that keeps
you stagnant and afraid to grow. I think
it&#39;s more of a catalyst to grow. How can
I do this? How could I have asked Janita
that question better?
Cuz I don&#39;t think she got what I asked.
And obviously you got everything that
I&#39;ve asked. But you know what I&#39;m
I do that pretty constantly.
And that&#39;s great
because like I said, I you know, it&#39;s
always and I tell my team, I keep it
simple. It&#39;s all about just getting
you know is and everything everything
else will fall into place if you have
the mindset to just get a little better
take that next step right
you can go a long way you can be close
to perfect on certain things so
absolutely because even when working
with clients when I understand that that
becomes a roadblock and they&#39;re seeking
perfection no no let&#39;s let&#39;s see how how
you have already progressed because here
going back to what we were saying
is that people focus on the what&#39;s not
going right or what didn&#39;t go right and
totally forget oh this did go right oh
this did work right because even even I
don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s your health and
even when we think about business if it
worked you want to continue to do more
of what&#39;s working so in the area of
business you want to make sure that you
focus on or identify by what&#39;s working,
all of the things that are positive so
that you can do more of the things that
are working, right? But again, with
people, they focus on the negative
without looking at and seeking the
opportunity.
Because if you don&#39;t see the
opportunity, you&#39;ll miss the opportunity
to figure out how you can refine in the
case of your business, your systems,
right? your level of communication with
your clients and your customers and the
way that you interact with those of you
all who have a team.
How do you how do you This is a qu You
said something. I&#39;m not going to say it
How do you All right. So, I&#39;ll give you
Being thick skinned,
being able to take
feedback, I guess
it can be hard.
Oh, yeah.
I still remember this. A couple years
ago, this guy where I work at now. So, I
deal with salespeople and I provide a
to the salespeople,
okay? And I heard through somebody else
that one of the salespeople was like, &#34;I
don&#39;t know why I call Lee. He&#39;s
And at the time it kind of hurt, right?
And I was like, &#34;God dang, that&#39;s
horrible. Useless,
But but I had to go to the mirror.
I had to figure out why why am I
useless? Because typically I try to
find a path forward considering
precedence,
considering the overall result of
whatever decision that I make.
And you know, without going too far into
it, I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t give this person
what they needed, but I still stayed
true to myself, so it&#39;s it&#39;s all good.
But I wanted to I wanted to figure out
to connect
and let everyone know, and you can&#39;t let
everyone know, but at least let that
person know that I have everyone&#39;s best
interest at heart
when I come with my decisions, right?
So, I had to think about that. And I
think it&#39;s important, I bring this up
because I think it&#39;s really important
for you to be able to take criticism
and not just be like, &#34;Oh, I can&#39;t stand
that person because they criticize me.&#34;
there&#39;s a reason justified or not
that that person felt that way at that
time about me and I had to figure out
what that was
instead of
getting on the defensive you know about
the whole thing with that person. So
what do you think is how important do
you think it is? And I think I gave a
good example, but from your perspective
just to have tough skin to be able to
absorb some of that and to go within
yourself and figure out what it is that
I did right or wrong because you could
have been absolutely right in this whole
situation and they&#39;re just a jerk,
right? But what do you what do you think
about that?
I always go back to because it it does
hurt. I know when people have given me,
you know, criticism or said things to me
that I did not like, it didn&#39;t feel
good. But to your point, I had to go
back and ask myself why why did they
feel like that or even go to the person
and have the conversation to get an
understanding as to why they said what
they said. Because a lot of the times
sometimes in the way that people receive
stuff wasn&#39;t the way that I intended to
deliver it.
So even if I was in fact wrong in my
delivery, there was an opportunity for
me to figure out how to correct it in my
communication or my stance in my
communication.
Right. Again, it goes back to the
opportunity of identifying how I can be
better. Either how I can be better in in
my delivery or even better in my
receiving what they said about me and
then course correcting from there. But
if we stay in a place of offense, then
you leave no room for growth and
progress and you remain stagnant is the
biggest thing for me.
Yeah, appreciate that. And in full
disclosure, the person said it to
somebody else who said it to me in
confidence. So I really couldn&#39;t go to
the person and be like, &#34;Why&#39; you say
I&#39;m worthless, dude?&#34; Like that&#39;s messed
up. So I just had to just reflect,
learn, and just move forward. So
all right. What would you say to someone
who feels unworthy of success even when
opportunity is right in front of them?
One of the things that first comes to
mind, the opportunity would not come.
Nine times out of 10, if you weren&#39;t
capable of delivering what it is that is
being asked of you,
and what I mean by that is, let&#39;s say
you receive an invitation of an
opportunity to do whatever a job is or
whatever it is, right?
And you&#39;re the one who&#39;s called to do it
only in the way that you have been doing
it. Talking about purpose, right? If you
don&#39;t take and embrace the opportunity,
you neglect someone from obtaining the
transformation that only you provide.
And a lot of the times the
transformation that you provide has been
through your experiences that you think
are so horrible
and that are actually putting you down,
that are actually preventing you from
embracing this opportunity.
So you have to shift the way that you
see one yourself
because if you see yourself from your
mistakes, guess what? You&#39;ll never
leave your current level.
Think about that. Let that sit in. Let
that marinate.
Now the way you respond as if that was
pretty heavy.
No, it is. It really is a it really is a
message, you know, because we get stuck.
we get stuck in all types of stuff. And
you know, just understanding
like it&#39;s just a moment in time. You
know, you got to keep moving, you got to
be resilient, you got to be
flexible and agile and all these
buzzwords that they have in business,
right? But those are real words that you
need to be to at least if you want to
continue to grow in life. Maybe
sometimes you don&#39;t times you&#39;re really
content with where you&#39;re at. Some
people have dealt with a lot and they
got to a good spot and they like this is
where I&#39;m going to stay. Been through a
lot and I get it. I understand that. You
know, but if you want to continue to
grow, right, you can&#39;t stay stagnant.
You got to take all these opportunities.
a message from this conversation here,
you know, a a message from an
interaction that you see when you&#39;re out
in the grocery store from two people.
All these things help us grow.
You know, I remember I used to tell
people, you know, I went to Iraq
to war and thankfully I wasn&#39;t hurt, you
know, impacted physically in any kind of
way while I was there. But it was an
experience.
When I joined the army, my first duty
station was in Alaska and I could have
been like, &#34;What the
but I went to it with an open mind
because it was an experience. You know,
I was from Maryland. This was in the
So, first thing I want to do was I need
a job other than this.&#34; You know what I
mean? There was no Indeed and all of
that, right? There was no internet when
I was in the army. So, you know, so I I
but I still I went in with an open mind.
I went in here&#39;s an experience,
you know? And you learn from it. You
learn beautiful things. I learned this
is different. When I went to Japan, oh
they are just like us.
They just look a little different.
But until that time, until I had that
experience, I thought they were
Japanese. We&#39;re Americans. There is a
distinct difference. And whatever was on
TV or media is who they were,
right? Treasure those experiences. You
don&#39;t have to go out the country. You
can go to the grocery store. You can go
to the mall
and just immerse yourself in the
experiences that are there.
Absolutely.
And learn from them. Don&#39;t be so
close-minded. Anyway, you know, you you
know that&#39;s in the interest of time
because I I don&#39;t want to waste your
time. Not waste it, but I don&#39;t want to
take up too much of your time. I think
we&#39;re over the limit now. But I&#39;m going
to keep asking you questions because 40
days to a better you sounds like a
powerful commitment.
what inspired the book and what kind of
transformation do you hope your readers
will experience from it?
Um, and what inspired the book is
literally when we transitioned out of
becoming homeless and I I was like,
okay, we&#39;re back into our own place now.
And I was like, you know what? A lot of
times people feel like they have to have
that one big thing in order to become
successful or just better. And I find
that it&#39;s not just the one big thing.
It&#39;s the many things that you do over
time that get you that result. That
slide edge, which is a phenomenal book
if you all and compound effect. If you
all have never read those two books,
great reads. And I was inspired. I said,
you know what? I&#39;m just going to and I&#39;m
going to write a book for somebody who
really doesn&#39;t like to read and give
them short tips on how they can become
better. And when my our son was an
infant, when he fell asleep, his mama
got to writing. And I wrote and I wrote
and I wrote. So my goal is for anyone
who just desires to be better in every
area of their life to be able to use
those 40 tips and they&#39;re simple cuz I&#39;m
a very simple coach and working with my
clients. I don&#39;t care how challenging
the situation is, we going to get down
to the simplicity of it and identify a
solution. And I said, &#34;You know what? My
goal is that they take these simple tips
and implement them over time to make
themselves better.&#34;
I like it. All right. Speaking of tips,
I&#39;m going to give you an opportunity to
give us some tips right now.
You ready?
I know you are. What are some what are
some daily practices or mindset shifts
that can help people start dismantling
self- sabotaging behavior?
Your belief system. So, one thing that
I&#39;ll say is this a lot and I I&#39;ll say
this because I don&#39;t want people to ever
fail because I think there&#39;s a
misconception that it&#39;s an overnight
process. It&#39;s an overnight thing. It&#39;s a
a get transformed quick. Transformation
takes time, right? Even for someone
who&#39;s getting prepared to be on a TV
show or a movie, if you&#39;re getting
makeup and all of the things, that&#39;s a
process, right? And it takes a while. It
takes even longer to better yourself. So
the first thing is you have to identify
like one of the practices that I have is
I&#39;m a big I love reading, right? And one
of the first things that I do before I
get out of the bed when I wake up in the
morning is I read a scripture. it it is
not a whole passage at that moment, but
I feed myself the word of God because I
have to have something positive go into
me because I can&#39;t control the external.
I can&#39;t control what people are going to
say out there, who&#39;s going to honk at me
when I&#39;m going down the street or
something like that or how people are
going to act. But I got to work on me.
So, I got to make sure I&#39;m prepared for
it. So, I give myself I feed myself the
word of God and I read 10 pages of a
good book a day. So right now I read um
10X is better than um than 2X a
phenomenal book. I mean great book like
great great read
and I work that&#39;s those are the things
that I do. I&#39;m not going to tell you
what you can do. I&#39;m telling you what
works for me and what what these things
do is literally helping me to shift my
way of thinking. All mindset is is the
positioning of your belief system and
what you know to be true. And the only
difference between you and someone who
is successful is their way of thinking
and your way of thinking. And if you
want your way of thinking, if you want
your external to be different, you got
to change positions in your way of
thinking. That&#39;s it. And that&#39;s
something that you have to work on. It&#39;s
like literally that seed with that that
example of the seed and the plant. The
plant is not going to burst out of the
seed and show a fullon tree or flower
the next day. It has to be watered. It
has to be put into the right
environment. You are likened to that
seed, my friends. You have to make sure
you put yourself in the right physical
environments,
right? And you have to make sure that
you water yourself, hydrate yourself
with life.
So, those are things that I do. And I
I&#39;m very like cautious about what I
watch on social media. You know how like
Let me tell y&#39;all a quick trick. Can I
tell y&#39;all a quick trick?
Tell me. Tell us.
Okay. So, if you all notice, if you ever
watch a real or short, it automatically
transitions to the next real or short.
The thing is, if you&#39;ve ever noticed
that regardless beyond your control,
once it gets to the end of that real or
short, it goes to another one. Be
careful and don&#39;t watch whatever the
next one is. Why? Because the algorithm
is going to show you more of what it is
that you&#39;re watching. So, if it gets to
something negative, guess what? It&#39;s
going to show you more of the negative.
I&#39;m cautious about what I watch. I&#39;m
cautious about what I scroll through.
I&#39;m I&#39;m cautious about who I&#39;m friends
with and what I watch on social media
because I know they&#39;re going to show me
more of that crap.
So, that&#39;s ways that I filter the
negativity in my life.
Yeah. That&#39;s a technical term, too, by
the way. Crap.
Yeah. We want to make sure that you guys
know that that we went right to the
and it is in fact crap.
It is
some good stuff out there, too. But if
you if you if you land in the crap heat,
you&#39;re gonna stay in the crap heat. So,
and it takes a while to get your
algorithms right before you crap.
Hey, so as someone who&#39;s gone through
some major identity shifts, what would
you say to a service member who&#39;s
transitioning to civilian life and
feeling lost or undervalued in this new
Wow. You want my honest truth?
Yeah, absolutely. Um, my honest truth
is, cuz and let this be known, I&#39;ve
never served in the military, so I can&#39;t
speak as that person. But one thing
that, and I I can only imagine, and I&#39;m
sure you could speak to this, is that
your identity does or can change, let me
say this, can change if you&#39;re not
careful. And it can change drastically,
if you&#39;re not in control.
So then you have to ask your question
yourself this question. Who am I?
That is the biggest question. I don&#39;t
care where you&#39;re transitioning in your
life even as a service member.
Who am I?
Because regardless of what was told to
you, who you are and what has what you
have been taught could be two totally
different things.
And the amazingness of asking the
question of who am I? What happens when
you ask a question? You get a what?
An answer.
So hopefully an answer
if you&#39;re asking yourself.
So either you&#39;re going to get the answer
directly or indirect.
But you got to be sensitive to the
question that you ask because you&#39;re
going to get clues to what the answer
actually is. So, even if you lost
yourself in the military or being a
service member, you&#39;re trying to figure
out how do I fit into this world now?
Who am I?
Who am I? And look for the answers. And
here&#39;s the other thing. Be vulnerable
enough to yield into what that looks
Vulnerability.
Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s great advice. That&#39;s
great advice for anybody obviously. Um,
military for sure. You built up to be
super tough,
you know, success focused.
Nothing can stop you.
But we also have clear directions,
clear, you know,
and when you get out of that type of
environment,
it&#39;s confusing. You start looking around
like, where&#39;s where&#39;s the direction?
How am I going to survive in this
environment?
All right. Who are who am I? Am I a
quitter? Am I this? You know what? What?
Who am I to feel this way? So, that&#39;s
that&#39;s that&#39;s good. I like it. I told
you I&#39;m writing a book on that, too. 30
days to figure out who you are. Um,
hey, what legacy do you hope to leave
through your work, your voice, your
book, your, you know, what legacy do you
hope to leave? Oh gosh,
that&#39;s a great question.
My prayer is that I leave a legacy of
one that is vulnerable.
Um because I I believe that people feel
they have to be either this perfect
person or what the world has named the
strong person.
without leaving room for being
vulnerable. And this is where anxiety
and depression and mental illness gets
to fit in because I always believe what
you don&#39;t face will end up facing you.
One of my legacies is that my desire is
to leave a legacy of wealth.
a legacy of a wealth of information and
a legacy of wealth as it pertains to
because I don&#39;t want our children to
just have money. I want them to know how
to take what they have been left and
multiply it.
I want my legacy to be a legacy of
belief in in a relationship with God.
Not because mama said it, but because of
your own experience as to what the
benefits are to that.
I can go on and on and on, but
yeah. No, no, those are great answers.
Those are great. Those are great answers
and I appreciate you sharing that.
That&#39;s a difficult question. It takes
some thought and you you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh,
no. Faith. I want to leave that. I want
to leave.&#34; Well, because ultimately, you
see, I&#39;m not going to get into that one,
but ultimately, I love the fact that you
said a wealth of knowledge and a and a
and a financial wealth as well, because
you can have all kind of money and just
squander it, right? And create problems,
just because you don&#39;t have that
knowledge about what to do with it.
Absolutely.
It&#39;s like, oh, I got a whole lot of
this. Let me go and do things
with no purpose. So, I like it. All
right. Janine, is there anything that we
didn&#39;t touch on that you feel led to
share right now?
I&#39;ll share this.
We shared a whole between the both of
us. We said a whole lot.
But I&#39;ll say this.
Identify the one thing that either one
of us said. Not a list of things, not
two things, not three things, not 10
things. one thing that either one of us
said and figure out how you can apply
that to your life
because the goal is as I&#39;m sure that
this podcast will impact your life. But
you don&#39;t want to be an information
hoarder. You want to be an implementer
to make yourself better. And the only
way that you&#39;ll be able to do that is to
believe that you can and to actually do
the work. So identify the one thing and
implement the one thing.
So beautiful,
so insightful and so to the point. You
are absolutely what you say you are. I
like it.
So how can the listeners connect with
you, grab a copy of your book or learn
more about success and wealth institute?
Well, I am on three. I have to think
about. See, I love that number three.
So, YouTube, Facebook, as well as
Instagram.
And the way that you can get access to
my book is, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be in
the show notes, but it&#39;s um
drjan.net/40days.
All right. Hey, Dr. Janine Mobly. I say
that right? Is it Mobly? I want to say
Mobly so bad.
But you&#39;ve reminded us today that
greatness isn&#39;t something we chase. It&#39;s
something that we have to unlock within
ourselves. From homelessness to building
a life rooted in purpose and prosperity.
Your journey proves that overcoming
self-sabotage start with knowing you
were created on purpose and for purpose.
And Dr. Jen, thank you. You see how I
slur because I&#39;m from Baltimore, right?
So, I try to speak I try to, you know,
say my words, but if I&#39;m uncomfortable
with a word, I just say it real fast.
Not Janine. Janine,
I&#39;m putting on I&#39;m being vulnerable. I&#39;m
glad you guys know what I&#39;d be doing.
And you can take these take these tricks
on you can learn not to do it, right?
That&#39;s the point.
But thank you for showing us what it
looks like to lead boldly, to live
intentionally and love unapologetically.
Thank you for having me. You&#39;re welcome.
Look, I didn&#39;t want to cut you off.
Thank you so so much. I appreciate you
for having me. It has been definitely a
blessing to be able to add.
