              <p class="mb-4">this story out of Canada. It&#39;s um pretty impressive show of union strength and determination. Um the about 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants were on strike on uh they are public employees should be clear. Uh, Air Canada is a uh a national airline and um on the Canadian Union of Public Employees President Mark Hancock was responding to a work order from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I I guess more or less the functional equivalent of our National Labor Relations Board. their um uh uh labor law is obviously different than ours. However, uh this board had basically said uh the strike is illegal. You got to get back to work.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And here is um that there the union president of Coupe, I don&#39;t know how you pronounce it, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees uh in Toronto at the Pearson airport. This was Saturday. This is the Cirb order. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m expected to say, &#34;Stand down.&#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m expected to direct you to go back to &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m expected to end this strike. [Applause] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ain&#39;t happening, my friends. Not on my watch. Not now.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Not tomorrow now, not &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I stated pretty clearly when this strike would end. I said it clearly then and I will say it clearly now. This strike will end when we get a collective agreement that works for our nation. And of course, you know, if a um if an employer knows that the government&#39;s going to step in and end a strike when it starts to becoming painful for the um it really diminishes the power of a union unless of course that union says, we&#39;re going to defy this order.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">yesterday, during the day, Hancock uh was I don&#39;t know if he was in the uh the Cube National offices. Uh but uh here he is yesterday um talking about the that order that was still in effect as of yesterday afternoon. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s no limit. We&#39;re going to stay strong.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">We&#39;re going to stay committed to making sure that those workers can do the job that they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads to afford uh caring for their families. And if it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We&#39;re looking for a solution here.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Our members want a solution here. But that solution has to be found at a bargaining table. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then uh late last night, well, I don&#39;t know how late it was, um the um Air Canada brought him back in. They had um uh meetings and as of last night, they struck a deal uh with the union.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh it remains to be seen if the union&#39;s going to if the membership is going to ratify it. I don&#39;t know the details of uh the deal. Um but it is a good uh I mean it&#39;s the more that we see unions labor fighting and um if not winning I can&#39;t assess this this deal obviously I don&#39;t even know if the um uh the the details have been released in any way but this type of fight inspires other people to fight and you know you&#39;ll recall Sean Feain had um about a year or two ago uh made a call for a general strike on May Day of 2028 and uh was calling on all sorts of uh unions to uh sign contracts and have them end right around that time. I was reading that a lot of what this dispute centers around is that uh these that Air Canada pays flight attendants when the planes are, you know, either taking a trip or in motion and they&#39;re trying to get pay as more traditional employees, which seems to make total sense.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And wasn&#39;t it true that last year Trudeau uh intervened in the um dock and railway rail uh strikes that uh there were labor was really unhappy with at the time. So I wonder if and I just don&#39;t have the expertise to to know this. Um, but if the CUP national president here kind of learned from that, what happened last year under a different uh labor leader. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, I&#39;m being corrected.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I guess Air Canada went private in &#39; 89, uh, but still had public sector union as um, uh, its employees. And I&#39;m also being told it&#39;s pronounced coup like the mayo, but I don&#39;t know what mayo. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That might be a joke. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; QP.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wouldn&#39;t take that as face value. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, it&#39;s QP. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; QP. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, so there it is.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, uh, people, uh, in Canada writing in to us on the IM saying that, uh, all the Canadian news coverage of the strike was so incredibly anti- strike. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t doubt it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Press &amp;gt;&amp;gt; all of I mean it&#39;s always often even here in the US it&#39;s the same thing.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">It&#39;s geared towards economic disruption and disruption to consu consumerism and that &amp;gt;&amp;gt; same way the rail strike was. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean and that&#39;s what neoliberalism is where like we don&#39;t and in the United States we don&#39;t have robust social services. We have a very threadbear safety net that the Republicans just took a hammer to.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So what keeps our society kind of together under over the past few decades has been basically kind of uh cheaper goods. And so that&#39;s how our press orients their coverage of the health of our economy. I wish that they would do so in North America around like the health of uh people&#39;s lives and workers lives and their incomes. So that seems to be a problem in Canada and in the US.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">QP uh I am public sector union steward here sharing the Air Canada story with members as proof you can violate the government order not to strike, achieve your goals and win. Um this is I mean this is the the the point of of acts like this. I mean and you know it&#39;s analogous uh to the stuff that we&#39;ve been talking about in terms of how you fight authoritarianism. One act, regardless of its material consequences in that moment, can spur other acts that end up providing more uh actual genuine material consequences.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">They&#39;re not mutually exclusive, but just understand that um any uh point, particularly in the context of what we&#39;re about to uh talk to Lisa Gilbert about, when we have you know, ICE and other feds uh prowling the streets of uh DC in military vehicles. Um these acts of defiance empower other people. And what may seem meaningless um very well may be just use the analogy you want and one link in the chain or uh one little butterfly wing uh that may um ultimately make real change. You know the butterfly uh &amp;gt;&amp;gt; a butterfly effect &amp;gt;&amp;gt; effect, right.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re a big Ashton Kutcher fan. You&#39;re always talking about it. I don&#39;t I have no idea about Ashton Kusher&#39;s involvement in that whatsoever. He did Dude, Where&#39;s My Car.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I was super shocked. You didn&#39;t even know the name.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That I knew cuz I had a buddy who was actually offered that role. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, really. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And uh he said he got up and he said, &#34;F that.&#34; And walked out.</p>
