So, we have a whole bunch of updates for
you with regard to Kilmerrego Garcia.
Um, just before we I play you the the
latest, let me bring everybody up to
speed. So, you&#39;ll recall that he was
wrongfully deported um to El Salvador,
country that he had been the judicial
system had come and said you cannot
deport him to El Salvador. The
government admitted the mistake but
refused to bring him back in spite of a
Supreme Court decision saying you should
try to enable his return. Okay.
government ultimately kind of buckles,
does allow him to come back, but charges
him with these series of crimes,
including alleged human trafficking, um,
and sort of use that as a cover and a
pretext for why, oh, we&#39;re not really
backing down and allowing him back.
Instead, we want to bring him back and
charge him. Okay. So, in the context of
that trial, he was released pending the
actual court date. So, he&#39;s released
last week. Now, he had to go back to
check-in um at the Baltimore ICE office
and they ended up detaining him. And
I&#39;ll give you the the rest of what they
plan to do next. But first, let&#39;s take a
look at Abrego Garcia speaking at a
rally outside of that Baltimore ICE
office before turning himself in um
being redetained. And we also have some
images here of him um saying goodbye to
his wife who does happen to be an
American citizen. Let&#39;s take a listen to
this. This is why I want to thank each
and every one of you who marched, lift
your voices, never stopped praying, and
continued to fight in my name.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you to my life partner and wife
Jennifer, to my brother Cesar, to my
mother Cecilia,
to my children, to my nieces and
nephews, to all of my family.
All right, so let&#39;s go and put the next
piece up on the screen. This is a terror
sheet with the very latest development.
So he turns himself in. He is rearrested
and the government indicates that they
want to deport him to Uganda. He can&#39;t
be deported to El Salvador. So they&#39;ve
decided that they want to deport him to
Uganda. That move has now been at least
temporarily blocked by a federal judge.
Let me go ahead and read a little bit of
this Politico story to give you some of
the twists and turns here. So they said,
&#34;A federal judge temporarily blocked the
Trump administration&#39;s bid to deport
Kilmar Oreo Garcia, a Salvadoran man who
has has become a symbol of Trump&#39;s mass
deportation agenda to Uganda. Um, this
judge on Monday ordered the
administration to keep Abrego in a
detention facility in Virginia while she
weighs his renewed effort to prevent
immigration officials from abruptly
casting him out of the country for a
second time in 5 months. Um, this is a
critical part um and helps to create,
you know, the an understanding about
what his legal challenge will be based
on. So, his lawyers say that the
administration had offered to deport him
to Costa Rica, something that he agreed
to. He accepted that, but they said they
would only allow him to be deported to
Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to the
human smug smuggling charges that he
faces in Tennessee. So he refused to
plead guilty in exchange for being able
to be deported to Costa Rica. And so in
order to punish him for not pleading
guilty to these human trafficking
charges, which appear to be pretty
flimsy at best, um in order to punish
him for that, they have said, &#34;Okay,
instead we&#39;re going to deport you to
Uganda.&#34; That is the specific piece that
um is likely to come under close
scrutiny from this judge. um at a
hearing Monday afternoon that Judge
Zenis said she had several concerns
about the rapidfire deportation
proceedings, noting a Burggo might be
entitled to go to his designated country
of choice, Costa Rica, rather than
Uganda. She also said if the Justice
Department used his deportation as a
cudgel to coersse a guilty plea, it
would be a violation of his
constitutional rights. Quote, &#34;You can&#39;t
condition the relinquishment of
constitutional rights in that regard.&#34;
So, that sort of brings you guys up to
speed. he&#39;s been rearrested. Um I think
you know one of the obvious conclusions
to draw is that if they want to deport
him before his criminal trial even
occurs tells you something sagger I
think about the strength of the evidence
that they feel um they have against him.
You know I think we always suspected
when they brought him back and threw
these charges at him that it was pretty
flimsy um pretty pretextual. They&#39;ve
never uh been able to they&#39;ve never you
know no judge has ever found he was even
a gang member let alone a gang leader.
um the traffic stop that this alleged
human smuggling charge is coming based
on you know the officers who evaluated
him at the scene let him go. No charges
were filed etc. So the fact they want to
get him out of the country before he
even has his date in court if this was
truly some violent gang leader human
trafficker etc. You would think you
would want to lock him behind bars not
just release him into whatever random
country you decide. I look, I can&#39;t deny
the Trump administration. Everything
they&#39;ve said has been And
that&#39;s just basically true about this.
Listen, some of us got taken for a ride.
I I&#39;ll raise my hand and I&#39;ll admit it.
Uh basically, not only in the original
deportation, the MS-13 stuff, the case,
I read it. Uh most of the accusations,
they&#39;re not particularly wellounded. So,
that&#39;s the truth. They&#39;re using the
Uganda thing broadly, it seems, is some
sort of like pay scheme for what is it?
for pleading guilty. So that&#39;s it. And
they want to make an example broadly for
deportation. So I think that&#39;s fair. And
I&#39;ll put that all out there just so
people know that I&#39;m trying to approach
this in a fair enough way. I do think
it&#39;s still worth considering. How does
this guy who&#39;s lived here since what is
it? Let me let me get the date
correctly. Is it 2013? I&#39;m fairly
certain. 2011. I apologize. 2011. And he
doesn&#39;t speak a word of English and he
can&#39;t give a press conference. How How
is that acceptable? And that&#39;s like the
more broad question that I think all of
us need to answer here. Garcia illegally
entered our country in 2011. He was not
removed during that entire period. He
came actually as an unaccompanied minor
to join his brother who also came here
illegally. In that time period does not
acquire the ability to speak English is
a low-skilled labor who has not low
skilled labor who has not graduated from
high school. And the broad current
position is that he should be allowed to
stay here and get some sort of pathway
to citizenship. In my opinion, it all
falls apart for his whole deportation to
Uganda thing when his lawyer quite
literally says with a straight face, you
can&#39;t deport him to a country where he
doesn&#39;t speak the English for doesn&#39;t
speak the language. D4, please. Let&#39;s go
ahead and play it. It is preposterous
that they would send him to Africa, to a
country where he doesn&#39;t even speak the
language, a country with documented
human rights violations,
uh, when there are so many other
options. His family suffered enough.
They need to stop trying to separate
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The official language of Uganda is
English. That is a tacid admission that
he doesn&#39;t speak the language of
English. This is the point that I think
people really need to grapple with.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isn&#39;t it English and Swahili? Yeah, but
I mean English is one of their official
languages. My point is just more broadly
that he has lived here since 2011
doesn&#39;t speak English. His day laborer
by his own admission has literally been
in this country for more than a decade.
And this is the type of person that we
are supposed to say should get amnesty
in a pathway to citizenship. I think
everyone should sit with that like that
is propos. We just had an argument
earlier in our show about the best and
the brightest. That&#39;s not what this
looks like. And I&#39;m not putting him down
as a human being. I didn&#39;t think his
human worth is less. His worth to the
United States as an addition. And if we
were to legalize that person,
statistically, what happens to somebody
who doesn&#39;t have a high school
education, who doesn&#39;t speak any
English, if that person is legally a
United States citizen, they&#39;re going to
be on welfare. Okay, that&#39;s just the
basic truth.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But he&#39;s not. And in fact, you&#39;re not
right that he&#39;s a day laborer. He&#39;s a
sheet metal worker for a local 100,
smart local 100 in Maryland, who
defended him, by the way, in the process
of all of this. I understand. And I&#39;m
also curious what you make of the rights
of his American citizen wife and his
American citizen children. Okay. Who are
also being dramatically punished because
again because the Trump administration
made a mistake in their deportation of
him, violated a lawful court order, and
refused to make a
That&#39;s why they&#39;re making an example of
him and trying to make his life
miserable, accusing him of crimes that
there is no evidence that he has
committed, smearing him in the public
eye. And so you I just I disagree on I
disagree on every level with your
characterization of who he is and his
value and worth to society. You know, I
think the fact that he&#39;s a sheet metal
worker apprentice, yes, I think that&#39;s
important. I think that&#39;s valuable to
the country. He&#39;s clearly assimilated
enough to have American wife and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s a commentary on America though
that you can live here and have children
and apparently have US citizen wife and
not speak any English. That&#39;s a huge
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t even know that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know how this is I don&#39;t know
how this is acceptable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Saga, here&#39;s the other thing though. I
don&#39;t even know that like there&#39;s a big
difference between being able to speak
any English and being able to give a
press conference in front of media and
feel comfortable in your level of
fluency. Those are two very different
things. So, I haven&#39;t personally
administered an English language test to
him. I know you haven&#39;t either. So, you
know, to hinge his citizenship and
whether or not he should be punished and
abused in this way on what his level of
fluency is in the English language, I
think is preposterous.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why is that preposterous?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Clearly, he has assimilated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you can&#39;t speak enough English to
your defense in English, why should you
be a citizen? It&#39;s really clear
assimilated enough to be fully
integrated into a work community, into a
social community, into having again an
American citizen, wife, and kids. And I
think it&#39;s thoroughly disgusting that
the Trump administration, rather than
admit they made a mistake, has sought to
absolutely destroy this man in order to
make a point and to never back down.
That is really the core of what&#39;s going
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;m separating the two
because I agree with you, okay? They
lied to us. It&#39;s absolutely true. 100%.
Absolutely 100%. They&#39;re smearing him.
They deported him wrongfully. In my
opinion, should have been deported a
long time ago, but whatever. Okay, we
are where we are today. Do I think he
should be sent to Uganda? No. All right.
Even Costa Rica doesn&#39;t make a whole lot
of sense. I&#39;m sure we have a we should
go through the process. I think his im
his his asylum claim is in my
opinion because the vast majority of
these asylum claims are
Especially in a country which
dramatically less violence. he can&#39;t
really fear as much now. Perhaps his
fear is from the government. I guess
it&#39;s a different story. Again, we can
litigate all of that in court. So, I&#39;m
going to put my cards there very closely
on the table. But again, at a basic
level, you cannot have a society where
if you have lived here for over a decade
and you cannot present yourself in
English, you cannot be a citizen. Now,
the point about being able to assimilate
is actually the opposite because the
problem is we have now vast numbers of
illegal immigrants and others who come
to the United States and have pockets
where English is not spoken. That is not
acceptable. And the po the even more
broad point very importantly is about
not only assimilation but also the
economic value. Yes, I understand it&#39;s
very hard for liberals to talk about
this. But when you&#39;re talking about the
addition of new entrance into your
country, you need to have an assurance
that those people will be able to stand
on their own feet. There is no no there
is no
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whatever he does. Is he on welfare? No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. But note what you just said. Note
what you just said specifically about
sheet level apprentice. That&#39;s part of
the reason I said day level uh work
laborer. And if you also look previously
working hanging out in a Home Depot
parking lot where he was arrested in
2019 is the quite literal definition of
day laboring. Now when you put and when
you put that together and on top of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; himself and achieve a more stable job
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on top of lack of English proficiency,
it is obvious that that question should
be asked. How can this person be allowed
to stay in the United States and should
they be allowed to become a citizen?
Again, this is the problem broadly with
speaking of immigrants as a broad group.
You&#39;re trying to l loop in like Nobel
Prizewinning scientists with somebody
who&#39;s a day labor who doesn&#39;t speak
English, who also entered the country
illegally. Those two are not
fundamentally the same. I believe you&#39;ve
uh agreed with me in the past that there
should be a requirement for English
language proficiency to become a
citizen. I don&#39;t even think you should
be able to get a work visa or anything
if you don&#39;t speak any English. Now in
this particular case, this is a problem
and an emblem of our broken immigration
system and it should not work for Kilar
Obago Garcia.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If he spoke English to your level of,
you know, whatever your standard is,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can he stay?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, well, no, but that&#39;s not the point.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So then why are you making that the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because because it&#39;s a an example of how
somebody who has lived here from 2011
doesn&#39;t speak English. That is an insane
insane thing that nobody apparently on
the left wants to grapple with. No,
that&#39;s hard.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have tens of millions of people here
who don&#39;t speak any English.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It does not offend me the way that it
does. I will certainly acknowledge that
to be the case. We don&#39;t have an
official language as a country. Our our
history has our history and tradition as
a nation has been there&#39;s always been
these immigrant pockets and communities
a lot of issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A a generation later, guess what? Their
kids are fully integrated Americans. So,
yes, for some people, you know what? I&#39;m
not that great at learning foreign
languages either. For some people who
come here, it may be more of a struggle
to be able to acquire the language and
the level of fluency, you know, that you
know that that you&#39;re looking for. We
also don&#39;t have right now if we had a
pathway to citizenship that was
conditional upon English language
acquisition. I have no doubt that he
would pursue that in order to be able to
meet the metrics that are set out by the
government. We don&#39;t have that. So there
is no motivation for him to learn the
language outside of whatever level he
is, which again I don&#39;t even know
whether he is language designed for his
motivation. No, the motivation again
should not be working for the people who
broke the law and entered our country
illegally. Since 2011, let me underscore
that. 2011, this person has lived here.
I&#39;m I&#39;m not putting down his worth as a
human. I think he has been treated very
badly by the US government. If he
actually stays and prosecutes, he&#39;ll
probably get himself a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; settlement. Here&#39;s here&#39;s what bothers
me, Sagger, is I don&#39;t look your view is
legitimate and there&#39;s obviously we have
profound disagreements about the level
of immigration that should be permitted
into this country and the value of
immigrants who come into this country.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What bothers me about your approach is
you&#39;re more outraged about this man who
Okay, yes, he crossed the border
illegally. Yes. Outside of that, zero
evidence he did anything wrong. Applied
for asylum, went through the process,
followed the court order, all of these
sorts of things, right? Contributing to
society, becomes a sheet metal
apprentice, marries an American wife, t
being by all accounts is a good dad, you
know, was there with his disabled son
when he gets arrested, etc. You are more
upset about that one man than you are
about this government lying,
trying to ruin his life, accusing him of
crimes he did not commit. I we can put
the uh we can put this DHS tweet D3 up
on the screen that you have a government
that can just to the whole world smear
someone who has not been found guilty of
any of this says DHS is thrilled that
this MS-13 gang member human trafficker
wife beater child predator is being
processed for removal to Uganda
that the government which has infinitely
more power than Kilar Abrego Garcia
could do this and that&#39;s not your
primary outrage that to me is just
that&#39;s hard for me to wrap my head
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I completely understand where you&#39;re
coming from and I&#39;ll explain it very
clearly. It&#39;s because I think for you
and for most people, they feel you
Kilmar as an American. I don&#39;t think
he&#39;s an American and I don&#39;t think he
should be or I think he is an emblem of
a broken society.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Honestly, it&#39;s irrelevant to me whether
he&#39;s an American.
This is about a government abu a
government that will do this to him will
do it to anyone. Anyone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; See, I actually first of all, I don&#39;t
think that that&#39;s true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is. Of course it&#39;s true. And second,
because of course it&#39;s not true because
nobody American has been deported to
SECOT. Now again, I&#39;ve I I have openly
said I was full of I was totally
been arrested by ICE and detained for
lengthy periods of time. You do have
massive crackdowns on the speech of
Americans and he is married to an
American. What about her rights? Why
don&#39;t you care about what this is doing
to her life since you&#39;re you&#39;re focused
for first and foremost on the rights of
American citizens? She&#39;s not being
prosecuted as far as I know from being
ruined. Let&#39;s be honest because she
married somebody who was here illegally.
And when you do that, there are
consequences. I mean I So just because
somebody who&#39;s married to somebody who
is legal, they get absolved. If I marry
a drug dealer, they get absolved of
being drug. Part of our immigration
system is meant to enable American
citizens to be able to marry who they
want. I mean, that&#39;s why we have process
for people to be able to obtain green
cards and then ultimately become
permanent residents and naturalized
citizens based on getting their, you
know, their marriage to an American
citizen. And so, you know, that seems to
not enter into your equation either. But
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but that you&#39;re reversing terms because
he came here illegally before he got
married. He broke the law far long
before any of this happened. if his US&#39;s
and wife had gone down to El Salvador,
met him down in El Salvador, tried to
bring him back here, it&#39;s a little bit
of a different story.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so she deserves to have her life
ruined and her family broken apart and
these American kids to lose their dad
and, you know, him be shipped to Uganda
and locked up and, you know, have the
whole weight of the federal government
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; set against this one man because they
won&#39;t admit that they made a mistake. I
mean, that is such an abuse of power.
And I don&#39;t know why you think that
anyone, American citizen or not, is
going to be protected from that abuse of
power when clearly this government is
willing to lie, to ignore court orders,
to refuse the Supreme Court order, to
put out their scurless allegations with
no basis. In fact, there&#39;s no limiting
principle on that whatsoever.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Again, I think it&#39;s entirely fair and to
the extent it has affected Americans, I
have spoken uh repeatedly against it.
Now again, it gets to the outrage and
it&#39;s about the system and I think he
represents the 30. Nobody even knows uh
what the actual number is. It could be
30 million. It could be 50 million
apparently according to more recent
statistics. I have no clue. But my point
is I am outraged by the fact that we
have literal lawlessness which is
endorsed and was created by the previous
administration which has wre mass social
chaos and a lot of very bad effects. I
think it&#39;s a good thing to make sure
that people who are here illegally, who
in my opinion are, not just opinion, I
think there&#39;s a lot of studies to back
it up, are depressing American wages and
also are basically being used as like
quasi cutouts for big business. All of
that I think is really bad. I think
somebody should try to fix it. And
instead, this becomes an emblem for the
outrages of the Trump administration,
which I, by the way, I blame entirely on
the Trump administration. and they have
lost me 100% in their ability to ever
convince me of what they&#39;re telling the
truth. That&#39;s why on the Killilmar case,
I&#39;m like, look, I&#39;m going to read it for
myself. I&#39;m not sitting here saying he&#39;s
some gang member or anything like that.
I don&#39;t think he deserves to be beaten
or tortured or sent to Uganda. I don&#39;t
think that that generally is how any
human being deserves to quote be
treated. So, I will totally accept
everything you&#39;re saying. I am talking
specifically about the next step for if
the Democrats and the liberals have
their way, which is he becomes a
citizen. I&#39;m totally against that. Not
just him, but the representation of mass
pockets of of the United States of
America, where English is not spoken.
It&#39;s Barack Obama who said actually that
when he walks down the street or tries
to go get his car fixed and he has to
hear Spanish and sees people waving
Mexican flags that it makes him feel
angry. I think it should make anybody
actually who lives here in the United
States and believes in some sort of
civic identity. The fact that we have
mass pockets of people who have lived
here potentially for decades who are
unable to speak the language. But again,
establish that&#39;s not really your
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, but it is a huge problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You certainly don&#39;t support like a
pathway to citizenship with an English
language requirement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh well, okay, let&#39;s flip it around. if
it didn&#39;t if there was an English prof
if there was an English language
proficiency if you had a let&#39;s say
decadel long track record where you
could prove that you not only had the
skills to actually get some sort of uh
some sort of not only education had the
education requirement had the ability
the skills to make sure that you&#39;re
never going to be on welfare that you&#39;re
going to be additive if you could
actually prove that your job and what
you&#39;re adding to America would not be
able to depress or be used as some sort
of H-1B style cutout then Maybe I would
as long as there was also stringent and
massive enforcement on illegal
immigration, but that&#39;s not the system.
And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t entertain the
amnesty or any of that right now because
I know it. It basically is a blank check
giveaway to all of the people here with
none of the same requirements. This is
the problem too about the broader
conversation I think around immigration,
you know, uh uh specifically like what
you were saying earlier, the conflation
of skilled and unskilled makes it so we
can be like, &#34;Oh, well, broadly together
they&#39;re all the same.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But don&#39;t you oppose all immigration?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I don&#39;t oppose all immigration.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I our current system. So, let let&#39;s
explain again. When I oppose
immigration, I&#39;m saying in the interim
period, we need an immigration moratorum
because we have so many tens of millions
of foreignb born citizens which is
causing and again in my opinion mass
social chaos. I didn&#39;t say no
immigration forever. I think probably
for the next 20 maybe 25 years. I think
it&#39;s important now if you look at it
broadly. What I mean look I think
another country. I think bad for
Americans. I think it&#39;d be bad for for
everyone. And I I just I don&#39;t agree
with your assessment that immigrants are
the cause of like social chaos and that
there&#39;s you know this massive non
assimilation there&#39;s you know in in
actuality the studies that have been
done have found that new immigrants in
this era assimilate into American
culture much faster partly because
American culture is so globally dominant
that there&#39;s already a lot of sort of
American cultural spread around the
world and so the you know acquisition of
whatever you know sort of core American
cultural traits happens at a much faster
clip than it did in previous
generations.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How can it continue to go a pace when
you&#39;re adding 1.5 million more per year
and you have mass pockets of people who
don&#39;t speak any English and which
apparently it&#39;s not even a societal
expectation that you can live here for
over a decade. I mean, I think the
reason why that bothers us so much is
because we have no civic understanding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you want to motivate people to learn
English, if that&#39;s a specific thing,
there&#39;s a very clear way to do that. you
create a pathway to citizenship that is
contingent on some sort of English
language acquisition, which I certainly
would be okay with and I think most
Democrats would support, but that&#39;s not
what you want.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I actually don&#39;t think that they would
support it because it would have to be
paired with a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is not true. They have long, this
has long been the standard as Democratic
Party position since, you know, but
probably before Barack Obama.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But but they don&#39;t believe in the actual
enforcement and the deportation where
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s not true. Barack Obama again was
the deorter and chief. Joe Biden
deported more people than Donald Trump
deported. Okay. So, it&#39;s such a canard
that Democrats are open borders. It&#39;s
for they
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; how did how did 10 to 12 million people
illegally enter the country under the
last administration. Even if Joe Biden
deported quote more numbers, 10 to 12
million people are here illegally
because of him. It&#39;s a basic fact. And
by the way, it&#39;s a huge reason why the
election was lost. This is the lack of
grappling. And you&#39;re saying the lack of
enforcement because what it comes down
to it is not everybody&#39;s going to pass
those stringent requirements that we
just laid out. So, what happens? They
got to go. And when it times for them to
go, well, that&#39;s when I know, oh,
everybody comes bleeding hard and
nobody&#39;s ever supposed to leave. But the
thing is, and nobody actually believes
in setting them back.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is where I think there is I&#39;m
confused by your position and then, you
know, we can we can wrap this up. I&#39;ll
let you have the last word. We can wrap
this up and move on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because you don&#39;t want any immigration,
but then you&#39;re also saying, well, you
would theoretically support a pathway to
citizenship that has English language,
but then you don&#39;t think Democrats will
support it. like what do you actually
what do you actually think is the
English language thing important? It
just seems to me that you think
immigrants are bad for society and I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I don&#39;t think
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I think immigrants have been the
probably most important part of America
developing into the country that it is.
I look at Kilargo Garcia and I see
someone who has been a valuable member
of who isn&#39;t on welfare who did is a
sheet metal of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he&#39;s not on welfare because he&#39;s not a
citizen. Like it&#39;s not like this is my
point. My point is he is working like
he&#39;s I don&#39;t know what more you want
from them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People who worked aren&#39;t on welfare.
That&#39;s come on. Like 40% of the country
is on food stamps right now. As if
they&#39;re not all working. Like that&#39;s my
point is that if you have a low wage and
you&#39;re unable to actually provide
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; an indication that he&#39;s some like you
know bottom feeder can&#39;t support
himself. Not that I even you know think
of people in that way. So it&#39;s just to
bring it back.
I don&#39;t get how you can look at this
story and not be first and foremost
horrified by the abuse of power by this
government against people who are
genuinely powerless in this system and
be concerned about what that means for
all of us immigrant and non-immigrant
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think I as I have said I take your
point and to the extent it has affected
Americans I have spoken out against it.
I do think the Trump administration&#39;s
actions have not only been outrageous
but deeply damaging to the cause that I
actually support. And just to wrap it
all together for what you were saying,
yeah, you were saying I think that all
immigrants are bad for the country. No,
I don&#39;t think that. I think that more
immigrants would be bad for the country.
When I say could I conceptually uh could
I conceptually see a pathway to
citizenship perhaps if paired with
stringent enforcement, very high
standards for who those people were, and
no more future immigration. All of these
things are actually non-contradictory
because what they come towards is to try
and have a society which can actually
hash out its differences and have a
civic understanding and not be one of
ethnic pockets which creates huge strife
basically and it degrades our overall
social fabric which I believe is the
current system as it is right now.
Deportation and enforcement is very
important until I see any particular
movement on that. That&#39;s why we
shouldn&#39;t even entertain so-called
pathway to citizenship citizenship talk
and especially if it were to be paired
with the current endorsement of the
system which brings some 1.5 million
people new people into the country every
single year. All that would do in my
opinion is pour gasoline on all the fire
individually. Much of these things work
together. Part of the reason why the
Republican party is where it is today of
no amnesty and basically broke the 2013
consensus is because it seems like the
amnesty always happens like it did under
Reagan and then the deportation and the
enforcement continues to flow as while
the immigration the INS act of uh 1965
remains in place with the current USCIS
uh numbers that are put into place which
brings some 1.5 million people on over
and over and over again and we have the
highest foreignb born population since
the early 1900s which I will remind you
was followed by a immigration massive
immigration restriction. There were a
lot of problems with that bill. It was
explicitly racist and it kind of caused
the Japanese to go away from us. I don&#39;t
believe in racial quotas or any of that
to be implemented. But it had a lot of
net social benefits actually if you look
at the way that we had assimilation over
some 40-year period. And I do think that
people need to grapple deeply with the
fact that we have currently part of our
social fabric and destruction is not
just economic. A huge part of it is
civic and it is is comes down to the
fact that we have millions of people who
entered this country illegally and are
somehow, you know, uh uh seen as more
American, you know, than the rest of us
or better actually citizens because
that&#39;s the way that a lot of the
Democratic leaders actually even talk
about them. I mean, I saw Amy
Clolobachar and others. It&#39;s like a
quasi system. And actually, as a someone
who was a child of it&#39;s offensive, you
know, to say that we are somehow like
better than others. I hate this whole
model minority thing that people always
talk about with Indians. It&#39;s like, no,
that&#39;s preposterous because it&#39;s saying
that like we&#39;re better than the people
who are already here. No, we&#39;re all the
same and we all should we should strive
to actually all kind of be the same and
to reach that understanding. That&#39;s my
broad thing. You&#39;re happy to respond.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Immigrants aren&#39;t the problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. I mean, you know,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the billionaire class that has rigged
this system and that pits us against
each other and makes it into some
freaking zero sum game that would that
yes delights in paying people under the
table and violating their labor rights,
that&#39;s the problem. And if you want to
deal with, you know, the tearing of
social fabric and the, you know,
societal strife,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the best thing you could do is to make
sure people can get a good job with a
high wage and have access to health care
and housing and for that to be
affordable and for people to be able to
feel again like it is possible to aspire
to a middle class life. And I think
immigrants have very little to do with
that and generally are positive in terms
of their contribution to society and
helping to people to achieve that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This will be the central question of our
time. By the way, I&#39;m probably going to
lose this fight just so everybody knows
thanks to uh most of the actions of the
Trump administration, which I&#39;ve got my
eyes very wide open to. So, uh just in
case anybody&#39;s wondering which
direction, you&#39;re probably going to win
Crystal uh after the Trump
administration is out of power in my
opinion. Hey, if you like that video,
