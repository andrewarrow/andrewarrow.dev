<li>Mark Maron has become "offer only" and says no to most acting opportunities due to lack of desperation or hunger</li>
<li>He has a pattern of initial resistance to projects, even good ones, often forgetting to read scripts for weeks</li>
<li>His manager understands this behavior and works within it, waiting for "cracks in the wall" to persuade him</li>
<li>Maron tried to back out of the Springsteen movie "Deliver Me from Nowhere" initially</li>
<li>He felt insecure about taking a small role after doing a lead in an indie film</li>
<li>Previous bad experience being cut from a Michael Keaton movie about post-9/11 lawyers affected his confidence</li>
<li>He directly texted director Scott Cooper questioning if there was enough for him to do in the role</li>
<li>Cooper's response that "it would be fun" made Maron reconsider and agree to do the project</li>
<li>Maron doesn't typically think of work projects as "fun" - even Comic-Con was just "something he had to do"</li>
<li>He played Chuck Plotkin, a real sound engineer who was pivotal to solving recording problems</li>
<li>The real Bruce Springsteen and Jon Landau were on set in "Video Village" watching filming</li>
<li>Springsteen told Maron "You're him. You're Chuck" after his first scene, validating his performance</li>
<li>Jeremy Strong (playing Jon Landau) stayed in character but could access Jeremy to have conversations</li>
<li>Strong suggested adding empty food containers to make the long recording session more realistic</li>
<li>Springsteen specified they would have eaten "roast chicken and sweet potatoes" during long sessions</li>
<li>A PA had to find specific food props, demonstrating the lengths taken for authenticity</li>
<li>The specific food details changed the reality of the scene for both the environment and Strong's character work</li>
<li>Maron learned to operate a recording board for his role as the sound engineer</li>

any memorable auditions in the last
couple years since we&#39;ve we&#39;ve spoken.
Well, it seems I&#39;ve gotten past the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now you&#39;re offer only, Mark.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kind of. You know, I kind of am. And you
know, I say no to a lot of stuff. Um
because there&#39;s there&#39;s like it&#39;s I I I
don&#39;t know why, you know, but there is
just zero, you know, desperation or like
I literally my manager will send me like
this script is pretty good. You should
really take a look at it. You know, like
two weeks will go by and he&#39;s like, &#34;Do
you look at that script?&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh,
no. I can&#39;t remember.&#34; What was that
one? You know, I I don&#39;t Clearly, I&#39;m
not hungry for it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You tried to back out of the
Springsteen. I just listened to you talk
about that one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was so funny. That was such a funny
moment. So stupid. Scott Cooper,
it&#39;s like I I can&#39;t really explain like
I have a a dread of like almost like
almost everything. And I think, you
know, good managers know this and and
they work within it. Like I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna
just say no to almost everybody.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m like, how where do I gotta drive?
You know, like it really comes down to
like how long, where, why, what&#39;s the
part like that sounds ridiculous. No
one&#39;s going to see it. Like there&#39;s this
whole barrage of reasons to not do
something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, you know, uh, but my manager, who&#39;s
actually in the room right now, you
know, he knows all this and he&#39;ll he&#39;ll
say like, I get it. Yeah. No, that makes
sense. And then I think like
subconsciously he just waits for a
slight crack in the wall.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I guess. And then he&#39;s like, I can
get in there. All right. But you know,
the food&#39;s pretty good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, Springsteen. But you said you were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#34;Well, I just done that. It was like it
was an undertaking. It took a while for
me to believe that I could do a leave
and carry a movie.&#34; And you know, I did
pretty good. I watched the final cut,
but in the morning that one. Yep.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, I talk I like Scott Cooper. We
text where I, you know, I&#39;m in touch
with him. I I&#39;m a big fan. We, you know,
oddly this is the full arc of that
story. Like, so I had this little part.
It was it was not a lot of lines, you
know, in the movie,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I just done a lead in a movie,
right? And now I&#39;m supposed to fly to
New Jersey to do five lines. So now my
manager&#39;s got to deal with this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
which is not unusual either. I&#39;m like,
is it like any actor could do this,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is like this is entrylevel acting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just did a lead in an indie that no
one&#39;s going to see,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know? So,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s going to be
make it to theaters, but I did it, you
know. So, uh so I&#39;m like, you know, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
this. And and managers like, you know,
it&#39;s all right. Yeah, I&#39;ll get you out
of it. Knowing full well that I would
come around somehow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But but he would do the stance every
time. Why are we doing this stance? you
know what&#39;s going to happen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, because sometimes I really mean no.
Like I don&#39;t give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] But there are
there are things that I&#39;m like I&#39;m just
fighting for for whatever. But
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I I just thought like really it it&#39;s
it comes from an insecurity was that the
diva element was not as large as my
insecurity in the sense that like cuz I
really felt because I had one experience
doing a movie that I got cut out of you
know that it was that uh that Michael
Keaton movie about the lawyer for post
you know 911. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
right. I&#39;m blank to be I got you. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, well, no one saw it. So, but somehow
or another, they put me in that movie to
play this kind of scrappy lawyer. And I
knew I wasn&#39;t right for the part. And I
don&#39;t know why or who was doing who a
favor or why the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] they wanted me.
So, I&#39;m sitting in a quarter trailer,
that&#39;s a closet,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in a shitty suit, you know, for the
whole day to do a scene that they could
have hired a day. Do do the guy the New
York actor a favor. They&#39;re just not
They&#39;re all just waiting for Law and
Orders. So give him the movie, you know,
like there&#39;s a guy that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; excited for this that is this guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a character actor part and I&#39;m like
I&#39;m not that guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, you were like, wait, is that Mark
Maron in that scene? And then he went
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It wasn&#39;t. It was like is that Mark
Marin on the phone call that they made
the scene? Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They cut his shoulder. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Right. So, so with the with the
deliver me um from nowhere thing,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, it&#39;s just sort of like, you
know, they can cast a guy that&#39;s going
to inhabit this better and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
small part.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and also I was sort of like, you
know, there&#39;s nothing for me to do with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I tell this to my manager and he&#39;s
like, well, we&#39;ll get you out of it. And
then I&#39;m like, you know, all right, hold
on. You know, let me just think. So, I
hang up from him and then I text Cooper
like I mean, who the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] does that?
He&#39;s a big director, you know? It&#39;s
like, you know, I know him well enough,
but like I text him, you know, I&#39;m like,
&#34;Hey, dude. I&#39;m just getting back into
the script. Doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a
lot for me to do here. Uh, am I wrong?&#34;
Like, the director. So, so he texts
back. He goes, &#34;Uh, no, dude. I I get
it. You know, uh, it&#39;s fine. You know,
uh, you know, we&#39;ll work together in the
future. I just thought it would be fun.&#34;
And then like right when he texts back
and I read that, I&#39;m like, &#34;All right.
No, I&#39;ll do it.&#34; He didn&#39;t ask. He
didn&#39;t have a negotiation. It wasn&#39;t
even a negotiation. I just needed
attention, I guess.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, you&#39;re right. I&#39;ll do it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the the idea that I thought it would
be fun. Like I never look at things like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You didn&#39;t even occur to you that fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Someone just asked me was Comic-Con fun.
I&#39;m like, &#34;What are you talking about?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How was you know what? It&#39;s something I
had to do flying on the plane with all
those those people fun.&#34; No. No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not fun, but it&#39;s
it&#39;s something, you know, apparently I
have to do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. They had nuts. It was fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t even think they had nuts.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then on the way back, like, you
know, after we&#39;d spent the whole day at
Comic-Con, they serve us food on the
plane on a 30 minute flight, and I&#39;m a
vegan. Everyone&#39;s getting these little
sandwiches. She gives me a salad the
size of a piece of luggage with
chickpeas and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] And I&#39;m like, what
am I supposed Are we serving the whole
plane? What? Who Who&#39;s the caterer that
that put this together? But
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but it was fun that the the the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the flight
movie was Okay. Good. Good. Good. It was
fun because it was um because Scott&#39;s
great and you know there&#39;s just a funny
kind of thing with it all uh that we
shot in the studio where they did
Nebraska where they were trying to do
Nebraska. So it&#39;s a studio they worked
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The guy I&#39;m playing is a real guy. Chuck
uh Platkin is that his name? I [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up
his name somewhere.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And um and Jeremy Strong&#39;s there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And Bruce is there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, that&#39;s the thing. John Landout is
Jeremy Strong and Jeremy Allen Light is
uh is Springsteen and Walter Hower was
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, Paul Walter Hower.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Paul Walter Hower was there because he
had a little part. So he&#39;s around, you
know, trying to get laughs every three
minutes. He&#39;s just there&#39;s always one
he&#39;s one of those guys on set, oh he&#39;s
going to do the, you know, try to do the
riffing, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But he&#39;s a great guy and he&#39;s he is
pretty funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um but uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he&#39;s very funny. I like him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t want there&#39;s no like feud. You
don&#39;t need new feuds in your life.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, there&#39;s not. He&#39;s very nice and we
we we text. He&#39;s a sweet guy and he&#39;s
great actor and he&#39;s very funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the the thing was is that a couple
of things was
well first um you know I did I I didn&#39;t
have I had to act like I knew how to run
a board. I was an engineer, sound
engineer and and and also Cooper really
laid it out to me that there may not be
a lot of lines here, but he&#39;s pivotal to
the story,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? you know, he&#39;s the guy that
figures out how to solve this problem.
And I&#39;m like, &#34;Okay, that&#39;s good.&#34; But I
had to figure out how to, you know, work
the board. And I talked to the guy who
worked at the studio, one of the
engineers, and we kind of nailed that.
And then I tell Cooper, I&#39;m like, &#34;Uh,
hey, man, you know, there&#39;s not a lot of
footage on this guy. He&#39;s a real guy.
So, I don&#39;t know what you want me to do
with that. I don&#39;t have a a point, a
source to to do him.&#34; Yeah. He goes,
&#34;Don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about it.&#34; I&#39;m like,
&#34;Really? Okay. You just I&#39;ll just get
the knobs going.&#34;
And we do the first scene and that&#39;s
like Bruce and John Lando. The real
Bruce and the real John Lando are in
Video Village the whole [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] time and
you know I know Bruce because I went to
his house. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And he remembers me because I I I you
know you know I make an impression
sometimes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But it gave me a shortorthhand with him
like he you know with his familiarity.
So that was kind of interesting after
every, you know, cut, you know, you
could be like go hang out with Bruce and
and it gave me a new appreciation for
Lando like in terms of like the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] he
gets for working the way he gets. He did
something kind of amazing on set that
that really is a testament to the work
of a real actor in terms of the pursuit
of truth part about it. But nonetheless,
so I do my first speaking part point
with the knobs and I have his talking
and I was like, you know, Bruce is out
there and I&#39;m like, you know, I got no
idea who this guy is. So I do the knobs
and I do the talking and cut and I go
out and right when I walk in the video
village, Bruce goes, &#34;You&#39;re him. You&#39;re
Chuck.&#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;Well, that&#39;s
coincidental.&#34; I didn&#39;t let on, but I&#39;m
like, &#34;Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ve been working those knobs for six
months, Bruce. You don&#39;t you know I&#39;ve
been training.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But like that I that he he bought
the personality of it, which you know,
whatever. I just figured he&#39;s kind of a
nerd. He&#39;s working for Bruce. He&#39;s got a
specific job. He&#39;s not going to be
bombastic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But Jeremy was kind of interesting, you
know, to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was just a really interesting thing
because he&#39;s in it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He does the thing where he&#39;s like locked
into John Landau. And it was good for
him to have Lando out there to ask
questions.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But he&#39;ll talk to you as Jeremy, but
just in Lando&#39;s body.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Got it. It&#39;s almost like, you know,
Jeremy&#39;s inside Lando&#39;s body and he can
access Jeremy to have a conversation,
you know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Yeah. It&#39;s like DDL as Lincoln but
still ordering the Starbucks as Lincoln.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Well, kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll talk to you, but it&#39;ll
be land out. But but he&#39;ll talk he&#39;ll
he&#39;ll he&#39;ll speak as Jeremy. But um uh
but he did this he had this moment in
the room that was kind of interesting
because he&#39;s always thinking and you
know he&#39;s in it and he&#39;s really in it
and he&#39;s really in it and you know this
process of trying to solve this problem
in the studio. It was an ongoing process
for a long time and at some point you
know you know he&#39;s always kind of like
you know should I do you know talking to
Scott I think I should be over here you
know he&#39;s he&#39;s very engaged with the
reality of at some point he just goes
hey wait wouldn&#39;t there be empty food
containers around there they&#39;ve been in
here a long time like you know food
takeout wouldn&#39;t there be food
containers yeah
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then all of a sudden I&#39;m like are
you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] kidding me we&#39;re going to
get through this tape you know but but
Scott servicing the actor you know is
sort of like I don&#39;t that&#39;s a Good
question. You know, if you just
indulging him and I wasn&#39;t frustrated
with it, but I was like, &#34;All right,
okay. So, this is you&#39;re going to deal
with this.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the truth of the matter is, you
know, they went and asked, you know,
Jeremy Strong goes, &#34;We he cuts and
we&#39;re all invari.&#34;
And Bruce is like, &#34;Oh, yeah, for sure.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then Jeremy&#39;s like, &#34;What would you
guys be eating?&#34; You know, and he&#39;s
like, &#34;With roast chicken and sweet
potatoes.&#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s
pretty specific, right?&#34;
So, so then like then there&#39;s that
moment. It&#39;s like, &#34;All right, so you
know Jeremy&#39;s right. We&#39;re going to do
this.&#34; And all I could think is like
some PA is being dispatched.
Find the sweet potatoes. It can&#39;t you
just roast chicken sweet potatoes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, he&#39;s got to find. So that guy&#39;s
running around New York going calling
different places on his phone for sweet
potatoes. But
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but the reality of the frame you you
know was changed because of it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. you know, and you know, set deck,
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been on
movie sets. Sure. A lot of times you get
to a a set and it&#39;s just loaded up with
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] You know, there are pencils, there
are, you know, like all this stuffing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But you but it doesn&#39;t read as
anything other than that looks lived in.
But when you&#39;re sitting there, it&#39;s
like, why is this snow globe here in a
sandwich? You know,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there&#39;s a story to the snow globe.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But there&#39;s not. It&#39;s just set deck.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dude. And we&#39;re all just trying to
justify our jobs, our existence. But I I
think it like you know it&#39;s when it&#39;s
specific you know like I think that the
food containers changed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; his sense of and and deepen the reality
of the environment I think probably on
screen and for Jeremy to to you know
find the truth in this character.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I&#39;m gonna look for the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was just sitting there like I&#39;ll be
looking for that and the sweet potatoes
and the seed.
