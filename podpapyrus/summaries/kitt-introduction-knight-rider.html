isn&#39;t polite to sneak around uninvited.
Be gracious, De.
I think the explanation is well overdue.
Damn right it is. What is all this? What
are you guys up to? People sneaking in
and out of here at all hours of the day
and night. Look at who&#39;s talking.
No, be quiet, both of you. Let&#39;s get
down to business.
I&#39;m running out of time.
And Michael here is now healthy enough
to carry on.
Carry on what?
I don&#39;t know what you people do out
here, but I just want to get on with my
life. That&#39;s not very grateful. Aren&#39;t
you the least bit angry at the people
who left you to die?
Angry doesn&#39;t even come close. But I&#39;m
going to adjust. You know why?
No, man. Because they&#39;re too big.
the kind of criminals that operate above
the law. Nobody can touch them.
I don&#39;t agree with you.
Well, you entitled to your opinion. As
for me, I&#39;m pulling out of here tonight
and I uh I&#39;m taking my car with me.
Prepare the car for him to great deal to
know about it for it&#39;s safe for him to
I must go to bed. I&#39;m not uh
feeling very well.
You&#39;ve just struck a dying man.
Hey, listen. I like that old man. I
really do. But Devon, I got to get on
with my own life.
You wouldn&#39;t have a life if we hadn&#39;t
brought you here. Remember, there are
still people who will kill you if they
find out you&#39;re alive.
But I&#39;m legally dead. Remember, Devon, I
don&#39;t even know me with this face. Now,
what&#39;s all this about my car?
No resemblance between that car and your
own is purely superficial.
What are you talking about, Devon?
That&#39;s my car. I left it out in the
No, it may look like your car, but in
actuality, this vehicle is probably the
most expensive car in the world.
My This is my car.
What&#39;s this? New paint job. Feels like
baby skin.
Boy, those guys did a nice job. There&#39;s
not a ripple on it like a mirror. It&#39;s
not paint. It&#39;s a finish bonded into the
molecular structure of a new substance.
You mean the metal?
It&#39;s not metal. And it&#39;s not fiberglass.
Excuse me.
Strike the surface as hard as you can.
Come on, Deon. I&#39;m not going to hit my
car. It&#39;s beautiful.
There&#39;s not a mark on it.
How did you do that?
Don&#39;t just stand there with your mouth
open. Get in the car. I&#39;ll show you.
Welcome aboard the night 2000.
Thank you. What&#39;s all this? Looks like
Darth Vader&#39;s bathroom.
It is a one-of-a-kind car, Mr. Long. It
is the fastest, safest, strongest car in
the world. It is also completely fuel
efficient and is operated entirely by
microprocessors which make it virtually
impossible for it to be involved in any
kind of mishap or collision. Unless, of
course, specifically so ordered by its
Don&#39;t tell me this thing flies.
No, but it thinks.
It thinks.
My car thinks.
We like to think of it as our car.
Now, in order to motivate it forward, I
recognize the more rudimentary controls
such as the accelerator. Devon,
I do know how to drive.
I would have preferred you to have let
me open the door first. However, as you
see, no harm has come to the car.
You also told me this machine couldn&#39;t
have a collision.
Not if the system is operable. And to do
that, you have to uh switch it on first
like that. Now, you&#39;re telling me I
can&#39;t hit anything. Trust me. I&#39;ll never
trust anybody again.
I&#39;m warning you, Devin. I&#39;m going to put
this thing to the test. Be my guest.
I don&#39;t believe this. I&#39;m playing
chicken with a 10 ton semi.
Deon, the car just drove around the
truck and steered itself.
Yes. It&#39;s marvelous, isn&#39;t it?
I hate it. I like to make my own
decisions. Well, the microp processor
said deduced that you were acting
contrary to your best interests. It had
two choices. Either to slow down or to
maneuver around the obstacles.
Well, then why didn&#39;t this thing slow
down instead of driving around the
truck? It would have been a lot safer.
Well, um
Well, why? Come on. I find a flaw in
their perfect machine here.
No, no, no flaw. I assure you. It&#39;s just
just what?
Well, it was showing off for you.
Well, you&#39;re telling me that this car
can just take off, go for gas or a car
wash just like that, huh?
That would be terrific if I happened to
be working under it.
It wouldn&#39;t harm you, I assure you. Its
primary function is the preservation of
human life. Your life.
By me, you mean anybody driving this
No, no, no. I mean you specifically.
You, Michael Arthur Long.
