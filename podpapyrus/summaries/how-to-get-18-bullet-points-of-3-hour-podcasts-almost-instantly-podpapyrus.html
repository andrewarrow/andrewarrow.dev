this site is all about being able to
read long podcasts instead of having to
watch the full like 3 hours. So, a great
example would be one that&#39;s been
recently posted here. Actually, if I go
to Oh, actually, these are all breaking
point ones. Let me go to a different
real example. And you notice that this
is uh on the actual hosted site, you
know, on a real domain. Uh the whole way
you&#39;re gonna run this is locally because
there&#39;s no way that this site is going
to have the exact YouTube video you
want. You know, this is very personal
taste kind of thing, right? Like all
these are the ones that I&#39;ve added that
I thought were interesting. And uh you
know, you&#39;re going to want you know,
your own ones. And what they are, you
know, if you just go into one of these
here is, you know, it just takes the
entire uh transcript you which you can
get from YouTube and it uh then runs it
through AI to get a nice, you know,
bullet point. These are 18 bullet points
which can really give you the just like
the oftentimes I&#39;ll read this and I will
not need to watch the video which I kind
of like but maybe YouTube doesn&#39;t you
know that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think this site
might go anywhere because there&#39;s really
no incentive for YouTube to be happy
with it or for even the content creators
to be happy with it. uh but it is
available for you locally in this like
open source code and if it&#39;s just open
source and you&#39;re running it locally you
know there&#39;s no vector to sue there but
on this big on a big site whatever do it
at scale it would be problem and also
the doing it at scale would be you&#39;d pay
a lot in AI fees as far as like
processing every single one of these
because it takes a bit of tokens to take
you know the full transcript and then
produce this doesn&#39;t take very long to
just do one but you know doing it at
scale would would would you know it
would go on your credit card and it
would add up. Uh, okay. So, the one I
wanted to show you is a little different
longer and this will be a good way to
show um how it&#39;s local. Uh, is if I go
to here it is popped up directory I have
and say open this is the exact same site
but now it&#39;s just these HTML files that
are local, you know, on this disc. And
you notice it&#39;ll look a little different
here because these I haven&#39;t actually
pushed to the to the site. There&#39;s this
one in particular I want to show you
about Amanda Knox. Now, if you don&#39;t
know who Amanda Knox is, she is uh the
girl that spent four years in uh prison
in Italy for, you know, she was wrongly
convicted for being involved in her
roommate&#39;s death. Um, and there&#39;s a new
movie out about her produced by Monica
Lewinsky uh on Hulu that really shows
exactly what it&#39;s all about. So, I got
interested in her and I noticed that
there were, hey, there&#39;s this threehour
podcast, you know, on Joe Rogan that she
did. Uh, here&#39;s the full transcript,
right? You know, if I I could just read
that entire thing. It&#39;s three hours,
right? Or I could go ahead and watch it.
You know, it&#39;s three hours. But just
reading these 18 bullet points, I really
came away just knowing exactly what I
wanted to know about, you know, the 3
hours she spent with Joe. Like I came
away with all these little things that,
you know, were fascinatingly
interesting. Just, you know, it was the
perfect amount of information I wanted.
And, you know, sometimes you&#39;ll find,
you know, gold in in these details where
you&#39;ll just be going along, you know,
you read every one sometimes or
sometimes you&#39;ll skim. But the one that
really got me here was um this one.
She&#39;s pursuing a stand-up comedy career
as another form of self-expression,
refusing to be limited by others
expectation of how a tragic figure
should behave. I had no idea. And so
then I Googled a tragic uh you know,
Amanda Knox stand of comedy and sure
enough she&#39;s, you know, she&#39;s a really
good uh public speaker and she&#39;s
obviously really uh you know, learned a
lot from those four years in prison. Um
and so I just thought that was
fascinating. And so anyway, the way it,
you know, this works is it all involves
this little um Firefox plugin called
Starrive. And Starrive started as, you
know, just a way to download YouTube
videos using YouTube download Pro, which
is the big open source package to be
able to download YouTube videos. And it
started um, you know, very just
basically download the video. That&#39;s it.
I wanted the MP4 that, you know, to
actually edit the video. Of course, it
came with the sound, too. And I started
getting into all sorts of things you can
do with the sound, especially if you&#39;re
downloading songs. that there&#39;s a lot of
audio stuff in there. But the thing that
I started kind of pivoted towards uh and
that&#39;s why there&#39;s these icons. It&#39;s
starting to show. One of the icons
that&#39;s let me start it up so you don&#39;t
get this error. These, you know, if I
come into here and start try run. So now
this back end is actually running. It&#39;s,
you know, a random port and the Firefox
plug-in knows to talk to that port. So
now if I run this again, you&#39;ll see this
is this is kind of important when you
start downloading tons and tons of these
videos because, you know, your disc
space starts to fill up. And so this is
just showing the overall this Mac, you
know, how much do I have left of this
entire Mac? And then the data folder is
where it&#39;s putting all its videos. And
so right now I have very little. I only
have, you know, less than 2 GB and
that&#39;s taking up, you know, this
percentage of the free space. So often
if I&#39;m adding lots and lots of videos,
I&#39;ll see this grow to like 50%. And then
I&#39;ll know I have to choose what I want
to keep or and usually I just delete the
entire thing, the data folder, because
it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s just a bunch of
random downloads that I&#39;ve done
throughout the day or week. Uh that&#39;s
that one. And um this one the copied to
the clipboard was kind of like the first
version of uh of uh Pod Papris. Have the
hardest time pronouncing Pod Papris. Uh
but and so this one was where you just
kind of hovered over uh the YouTube
video you wanted and then you click this
and then you got the transcript on your
clipboard and then from there you could
go and paste it in AI and do what you
want. Uh Pipers just kind of did that on
steroids basically where you don&#39;t have
to copy it to your clipboard anymore.
You know, let me just show you the
example of how it actually works on
YouTube. So if I come to YouTube
and you know I kind of slide through
here and decides the one I want. You
know this is just my feed but you know
you can go to any YouTube video. In fact
if I don&#39;t that&#39;s not that&#39;s
specifically my feed but if I go to like
you know here it is the homepage I can
here. Let&#39;s pick this one trouble on
set. Okay. So in order to download and
this is like this is a good example
because it&#39;s only 5 minutes. Uh but you
know the real value shines when you find
you know three-hour podcast. I did a
10-hour one once. Yeah, it had no
problem. It did 10 hours. All right. So,
come over here to start drive and see it
says mode default. So, I&#39;m going to
change that to pod padras pod pepper.
And then I come back over here and when
I mouse over it, it turned red. It says
transcript downloading. And then if we
come back here, let&#39;s see what make sure
we get no errors. So, it looks like it&#39;s
working. So, this won&#39;t take long
because it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s a five
minute one. So, let&#39;s just see what
happens. And you, you know, we&#39;ll know
when it&#39;s done. Oh, there you see how
it&#39;s saying generating bullets using
quadci. So that this is the call that
takes the longest, right? And and
depending on how big the text is, you
know, the longer it takes, but uh if I
come over here, the way we&#39;ll know it&#39;s
done is, you know, right now there are
one, two, three pending ones. And so Oh,
yeah. So now it should be up to uh four
or I think we just caught it. There
actually were three. So So it was done
right before we ran that. And so if I
come back here to index, I should have
ah there it is. That&#39;s the latest one.
So now, you know, it&#39;s that simple as
far as, you know, getting the ones you
want. So the way I usually do it when
I&#39;m um, you know, going through my
particular feed is like, you know,
rather than clicking on the actual
YouTube video, you know, it&#39;s just like,
oo, how about this one? And then I come
down, I&#39;m like, sometimes you
accidentally do one too, which is no big
deal. Uh, you know, or you come down and
if you&#39;re very careful of how you hover
over, you know, you can make sure you
get just the one you want, right? And so
anyway, that is um, you know,
pod pepper in a nutshell. It&#39;s all open
source, including this template, you
know, to build this. And so, yeah, the
the way I see people using this is
basically to developers. It&#39;s not really
meant for, you know, someone that&#39;s not
technically sav savvy to be able to set
this all up because you do have to be
able to install the plugin. You know,
installing the plugin involves going to
about debugging uh this Firefox and you
know, you have to click this load
temporary add-on and every time I make a
change to the to the extension, I always
have to click this reload, right? And
so, and then that&#39;s just the front end,
right? That&#39;s the that&#39;s the the thing
that&#39;s making, you know, YouTube do
these uh these highlights and making it
actually send the information to the
back end. And then the back end itself,
of course, you have to be able to run
and it&#39;s it&#39;s a go back end. So, you&#39;d
have to be able to download all the
source, type code, build bill. So, yeah,
I mean, it&#39;s you don&#39;t have to be a
genius to do to run it, but you probably
wouldn&#39;t be able to give it to like um I
don&#39;t know, someone over 50 that doesn&#39;t
have computer skills. Uh enjoy enjoy
your summaries.
