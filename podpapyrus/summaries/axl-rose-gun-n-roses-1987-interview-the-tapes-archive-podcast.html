<li>Rose grew up in Indiana in a conservative environment where people were judgmental about musical tastes</li>
<li>He was kicked out of home at 16 for refusing to cut his hair, but later rebuilt his relationship with his father</li>
<li>The British press falsely reported Rose as a "poodle murderer" based on a misunderstood comment about disliking poodles</li>
<li>Guns N' Roses found great success in England, starting at the Marquee and moving to Hammersmith Odeon quickly</li>
<li>The band recorded Appetite for Destruction live in the studio with drums, rhythm guitar and bass in the same room for energy</li>

<li>Rose had very strong artistic convictions and refused to compromise his music for commercial success</li>
<li>The band was frustrated by limited radio and video play, with only 4 songs containing obscenities out of 12 tracks</li>
<li>Rose criticized radio stations for being driven by advertising dollars rather than artistic merit</li>
<li>He called Whitesnake "the biggest sellout" for making mellow versions of songs for radio play</li>
<li>The band toured extensively with Mötley Crüe and Alice Cooper to gain experience quickly</li>
<li>Rose spent most of his time preparing for shows and couldn't party like other band members due to vocal demands</li>
<li>The album was charting between 50-60 despite limited airplay, which Rose considered good for a new band</li>
<li>Rose believed in doing multiple short tours with different bands rather than one long tour to gain varied experience</li>

welcome back to the tapes archive
where we release rare interviews that
need to be heard
in this episode we have guns n roses
front man axel rose
at the time of this interview in 1987
rose was 25 years old and was promoting
an upcoming tour of japan
appetite for destruction hadn&#39;t even
cracked the top selling 50 albums
and it would be at least another seven
months before the ban really took off
in the interview rose talks about
growing up in indiana the making of
appetite for destruction
whether he murdered a dog and which band
is the biggest sellout the interview is
conducted by steve harris
to learn more about steve who is new to
the tapes archive team
please check out our podcast only
interview with them
which is out now thanks for tuning in
and now it&#39;s time to open the vault
yes i&#39;d like room 207 please
yes one moment okay
hello uh hello uh my name is steve
harris i&#39;m calling
from japan yes what&#39;s happening guy oh
hi axel
hold on let me get a cigarette okay
what&#39;s happening
we were kind of a little bit worried
that you know in the middle of your big
victory return there you&#39;d be
out partying instead of waiting at the
hotel for the phone call no i&#39;m setting
up the party to come over to me right
i just got in yesterday because i went
i&#39;m from indiana and i had been there in
about two or three years and i went back
to visit my family and my friends
why did you decide to fit that right in
before the homecoming there
well just because it was like i hadn&#39;t
been back in two years
and the last time i was back there i
just told myself i&#39;m not coming back
until i get a record out
because too many people keep trying to
say oh you&#39;ll never get anywhere crap
like that i finally said okay i got
three days
i can go back and just see what it&#39;s
like it was great
and you always been known as the town
rock and roller back then a bit
yeah a bit but you have to remember that
in indiana people are real opinionated
and biased and things like that so i
have a real open mind and i listen to a
lot of material
by listening to a lot of material you
listen to rolling stones within your bag
people think like that back there you
know call you all kinds of different
names depending on what you listen to
and since i listened to everything i was
called everything in the book all at
things were still that way when you even
when you were growing up you&#39;re not that
like uh 25 i&#39;ll be 26 in february
it&#39;s only even 10 years ago people were
still thinking like that huh
oh yeah well indiana is really closed
off from the rest of
the world maybe not chicago so much but
even chicago a bit you know isn&#39;t
it&#39;s a huge city but it&#39;s not like l.a
or new york or in texas or florida
the midwest likes to just keep itself to
itself and everybody else has a problem
that&#39;s how they look at it you know it&#39;s
like they don&#39;t venture out to the world
where people from texas
they go to la or they go to new york on
vacations and stuff but it&#39;s not like
that a whole lot in the midwest people
don&#39;t get out too much
well what do you have to listen to to be
considered normal there well it used to
be leonard skynyrd
aerosmith which i was amazed at
aerosmith because tyler wore makeup but
for some reason it was okay for tyler
but not okay for nick
it&#39;s kind of weird but like it was a
certain group of kids you know
a certain group of people and that they
grew in numbers and they had a big
influence on me you think the best sort
of conservatism
led you in the direction you were to go
in with a sort of a backlash
yeah but i&#39;ve drawn from the
conservatism itself i&#39;ve found places
where i can
could be considered a conservative i&#39;ve
i&#39;ve drawn from both sides i always work
at trying to put things back together
what i say back together is people will
have an opinion and so
immediately before they&#39;ve even met
they&#39;re not together when i say
back together means like we could be
friends you know like
maybe in five years we can work it out
and be able to understand each other so
i always talked with some guys that i&#39;ve
every year of school with we didn&#39;t
really understand each other until this
time and they weren&#39;t just being
talking because i was a rock rocker they
were talking to me
because they finally had some respect
for me and they were going well he&#39;s not
full of crap because so many kids back
there talk about being advanced
they talk about getting out there but
it&#39;s on top it&#39;s all time it&#39;s all
wishes and pipe dreams and things no one
goes out and really puts their balls on
the line why is that
scared it&#39;s easy to live at home in
indiana with your parents and you know
work at your parents job it&#39;s what
everybody else does
for you when did the big break coming
when did you decide that you were gonna
bust out of the mold
well when i got kicked out
when i got told to leave got told cut
your hair and i said uh no
he said go i said i&#39;m leaving that was
like when i was 16
but now my dad is one of my closest
friends i have
it&#39;s taken us 10 years to build up that
kind of relationship again
but we&#39;ve worked out a little by little
and it didn&#39;t start happening just
of my parents did just happen this year
it&#39;s been
coming back together over the last five
years well you&#39;re being his son he must
surely understand your rebellious spirit
because i&#39;m sure that exists in him as
yeah i was telling a friend just
recently that still has hard feelings
against my
father i was telling him i was going
yeah well
one reason dad was so hard on me was
because he didn&#39;t know that i was
following the things he taught me to do
to go for your dreams and things he
thought i was messing up he didn&#39;t know
my dog i haven&#39;t seen in four months
the famous dog they say i go murdering i
don&#39;t want to break up a tearful reunion
they said you were murdering your dog in
england now he remembers
now he&#39;s jumping around losing his mind
okay so what&#39;s happening
yeah you were talking about how they
said you murdered your dog in england
what&#39;s the story behind that
i don&#39;t like poodles and i told some guy
that everything about poodles makes me
want to kill him so next thing you know
there&#39;s this magazine in england
talks about this band in l.a where this
guy&#39;s a self-confessed poodle murderer
so then they have like the national
enquirer type papers over there and all
those things came out
calling me a dog butcherer that were
busier than the beastie boys
is that rather representative of the
type of treatment you received by the
british press
oh well it worked out good and bad you
know but it was kind of fun as long as
but now you know there&#39;s things in
magazines here hit parader where they
now they&#39;ve they
got quotes of slash saying i run over
dogs and he never said that
yeah tork is like i i found out weird i
had this little dog right
and i got him when he was just really
really little my father was explaining
how he imprinted off me
you know because he never imprinted off
other dogs and things so he thinks he&#39;s
a person
and and all the rockers like like him
it&#39;s funny that everybody hates little
dogs but this dog is like a party dog
it&#39;s funny
he&#39;s your spud&#39;s mackenzie
girl and has had yeah that&#39;s a big why
getting back to england here your your
success there was rather phenomenal as a
matter of fact among uh
the current wave of l.a bands that
perhaps you stand out as the most
successful band in england having been
i guess you started the marquee and went
to hammersmith odium
rather quickly what&#39;s behind the success
there what do you think is making you go
over in england whereas
they turn a cold shoulder to everybody
else from l.a well you know
i think it&#39;s kind of like if you think
back in the 70s and stuff a lot of
like henry&#39;s went over to england to
break and a lot of
real blues bands hard rocking blues fans
have gone to england to break
or been from england and it&#39;s like they
were glad to see it back
because they think a lot of things are
pretentious they&#39;re not into a lot of
the new bands
they like them they&#39;re okay because
that&#39;s that&#39;s what there is out there
but they think it&#39;s a lot protected they
think it&#39;s real pretentious
and they thought we were the same way
but then we went over there and showed
we weren&#39;t
and they liked that and they just
started catching on was the
crowd reaction quite a bit different
from in the states in the states like we
hadn&#39;t toured in the states
so we&#39;d only been in la there and l.a
crowds have seen everything because they
go to the shows every weekend or every
almost every night and so they don&#39;t get
as rowdy over
here at least in l.a so much and lisa in
the club scene now that we&#39;re doing
bigger places
then you get a lot of people that never
seen you before and they&#39;re a rowdy but
the rock crowd i mean they were around
when molly crew and wasp were starting
they&#39;ve seen everything it doesn&#39;t
bother you that they don&#39;t get as rowdy
if they&#39;re there they like it the the
reactions in england were different
compared to the places we played the one
place bristol colton hall was full of
slammers and stage divers and people
jumping off the balconies
jumping off amplifiers we did a show in
manchester
the people just stood there they all
stood up the whole time right
and some of them they sang the songs and
stuff but not as much as other places
we were having so much problem with
feedback on stage i didn&#39;t know that the
people in the crowd weren&#39;t hearing it
through the main pa it was just our
monitor system
and so we came back and did one song on
corn we left
we went up to our realm didn&#39;t think
they liked us right
well then about 15 minutes later they
started screaming we didn&#39;t know it
because we were like three stories up in
this room
security was keeping everybody away from
us and then
the reviews from the show were the
world&#39;s greatest band
you know it was very surprising we
thought they hated us but basically they
were kind of mesmerized
they didn&#39;t know how to react with that
experience under your belt now
uh do you think you&#39;d approach like say
a future world tour differently i mean
what did you learn from the experience
gained a lot more confidence in working
the stage and dealing with crowds and
you know then we came back we did a club
tour of new york playing new york was a
lot like playing la
you know we had to win those people over
and then we went out with molly
and that was pretty insane any night
that we did two nights in a row the
first night you know we&#39;d get them going
but if we did two nights in a row when
we came back for the second night they
were like
whoa now we know who these guys are the
first time people see us
a lot of times unless they really hurt
us and really into us they&#39;re more into
watching and checking us out you know
and watching every little thing
like by this time you do a second night
they&#39;d lose their minds they were like
yeah now i can let myself go
it&#39;s cool to act like i like these guys
we&#39;re really into being very real
it&#39;s not an act it&#39;s not like a skit we
put together the night before because we
think the kids will like it
it&#39;s something we want to do we don&#39;t
quite pre-plan things except kind of the
song list and i
always kind of play that by how the
crowd is going what song i&#39;m going to do
in a row kind of sometimes i&#39;ll change
it completely
right now we&#39;re using fred cory from
cinderella
because our drummer has a broken hand
and so him and fred are really good
friends and fred flew in and fred knows
all the songs because he has time off
right now
and so the other night when we were
playing with alice cooper i met fred
play two songs he&#39;d never played before
at all in his life
live how did that work out he did great
i told the crowd i go not bad for guys
never played this song before
and they went screaming well it sounds
like your shows are quite a workout for
you guys as well
you find it&#39;s rather draining oh well
yeah i mean it&#39;s like but i spend most
of my time just making sure i&#39;m ready to
go on stage
how do you stay fit for the show i get
lots of rest
i drink lots of water for me personally
it&#39;s like i&#39;d like to party as much as
the other guys but
they don&#39;t have to worry about if
they&#39;re able to sing they can get up and
play their guitar
even if they got trash tonight before or
the next day doesn&#39;t
hurt my energy so much in running around
but what attacks me first isn&#39;t my voice
i can&#39;t really go party unless i know i
have a few days off
you said that this tour of england was
basically the first one outside of l.a
you think you you&#39;re ready for the long
haul though oh yeah yeah we came back
from england and
we did the cold thing before we went
back to england for a month and a half
with the coal
through canada and then down the west
coast and then over to louisiana you
the southwest and then we did uh
england we came back and we did clubs
for two weeks on the east coast and then
we went with molly for a month and then
we went for alice cooper for two weeks
now we&#39;ve had like three four days off
and we&#39;ll be doing these four shows here
and then we have a new year&#39;s eve party
that we have to play
and then we&#39;re doing a show on the fifth
and in the meantime we&#39;ll be in the
rehearsal series the whole time
then we&#39;re going back with marley for
two weeks in europe then we&#39;re trying to
another band to go with in the spring
what i like a lot is the fact that we&#39;re
going out
doing all kinds of different things
rather than just sitting and waiting
or rather than going out with a big long
year tour with one band or
with two bands this way we get all these
different experiences
in one year by next summer we&#39;ll be like
a veteran touring band that&#39;s been
touring for like five years
we learn real quick okay it&#39;s better to
have this kind of oxygen mask it&#39;s
better to have this kind of guitar stand
it&#39;s better to have this
things to make it run smoother yeah you
guys are working at a at a remarkable
pace right now who&#39;s
responsible for uh putting the schedule
together so tightly
we work with a guy named bill elson and
his secretary shelly saw
it&#39;s our agency and then our manager
alan niven
and our drive because we do not like to
sit on our ass
because then we just get into drugs and
because we get so bored so this keeps us
moving these people are pretty much
experienced i guess in the field they
know how to set up a
up-and-coming ban and put you on the
right course yeah and also we have an
idea of what we want to do and what
would be good for us too we have full
say so and
all that who will tour with so we won&#39;t
tour with you know
there&#39;s been people we&#39;ve turned down
already which i won&#39;t get into yeah have
you had like any say
mentors or people you want aspire to
become like well there was people that
were our favorite bands
i figured touring with molly crew would
be a great learning experience
that would be exciting opening for alice
cooper it&#39;s funny we&#39;d leave alice
cooper on stage and go back
go backstage and get our showers and
have an old alice cooper taped in in the
playing not because we&#39;re on tour with
house coopers because it&#39;s stuff we
listen to
then i go wait a minute man we shut the
tape off we&#39;ll go out and watch it live
the first time in our lives it&#39;s kind of
funny that you mentioned motley crew
because actually the magazine i&#39;m doing
this interview for
one of the reasons they wanted to do
this interview is so they could sort of
clear up a misunderstanding here
you seem to be compared a lot to bands
like motley crew
however this guy from the magazine who
put together the questions here
he seems to think that there&#39;s a little
something deeper going on in this kind
of the showbiz flash of motley crew
is that a valid opportunity they have a
more theatrical thing which for its own
aspects and the way it&#39;s done they work
very hard at it and i have to respect
those things they have their own beliefs
and way of doing things if they&#39;re
motley crew we&#39;re guns and roses you
know we have our own way of looking
at things and things we will and won&#39;t
do they have their things
like they do a planned show almost every
note we don&#39;t do that it&#39;s not
it&#39;s something we don&#39;t believe in but
then again i&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s bad
just because they do it
it&#39;s easy for a band to say oh what they
do sucks about another bat
but then when you&#39;re out there touring
with them and seeing all the work that
they put in it
and how professional they are and how
much they care and love what they do
but you guys basically aren&#39;t into any
sort of posturing or creating images
that don&#39;t really
reflect your uh your actual lifestyles
not at all it&#39;s us people go oh actually
why isn&#39;t your hair up well i can&#39;t do
my own hair worth the crap but i can&#39;t
afford to have someone sitting there
doing my hair every day
plus maybe i&#39;d like to keep my hair and
if i did it every day maybe it&#39;ll fall
out and i don&#39;t want that tap
so it&#39;s like if i feel like putting my
hair up i do it if i don&#39;t work my
the album appetite for destruction seem
to be pretty much straight ahead
guns and roses no flashy producer or no
artifice by
computer or trickery or anything what
exactly did you have in mind was this
sort of a live approach
it was done live the drums the rhythm
guitar and the bass
are all live in the same room so there&#39;s
bleeding of the instruments into each
other&#39;s mics and things like that
just to get the most energy and a good
life feel to this arm
it was very hard to find someone to
produce the record because
some of the main producers of our
favorite materials 70s
have changed their styles their approach
or burned out
or people that the record industry won&#39;t
work with anymore you know because they
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing anymore
they&#39;ve got 200 drugs or something
so it took us a long time to find you
know mike plank
and mike clink it&#39;s like we worked with
him and it&#39;s basically kind of like a
co-produced album
we got him for a lower amount of money
and then he in turn gave us full freedom
to do whatever we wanted which
worked really good for us he trusted me
a lot in the studio you know with all
the vocal i did because most of the
harmonies and stuff
i came up with making it so easy and
paradise i came up with the night i was
recording those parts
because i&#39;d never had the opportunity to
work on it before you
had these ideas just brewing in your
mind and then when you tried them in the
studio you found they worked
you didn&#39;t come come up against any
brick walls or anything huh in some
places you had ideas burning in your
in other places you didn&#39;t know what to
do in that part but you heard this part
and then right when you heard it
you thought yeah and this part of
working there too and what if i did this
now i&#39;ll try this one and see if that
works and a lot of times you had things
that worked sometimes you had things
that didn&#39;t
you just decide what was best at the
moment what felt right what sounded good
take a tape home and listen to it that
night the next day decided if you&#39;re
going to keep it or not
it was real exciting creating experience
if you could go back again you think
you&#39;d change anything at all
no the only thing i would like to do is
uh i wish we would have more time to mix
but we were
working on a release date there was a
couple songs i didn&#39;t feel we had enough
time to get just right
paradise city i think could have been a
little clearer but we were mixing two
songs today to make a release date there
was all kinds of reasons why we had to
make that release date
like getting the record out before
england sets nerves in the month of
august and things like that
it was all kinds of reasons why we had a
certain amount of time that we had to
get it done
so we just did the best we could in that
amount of time we didn&#39;t really
compromise
we still i think hit pretty close to the
mark we were wanting to hit
there isn&#39;t really anything i&#39;d want to
change i mean there&#39;s two
words i think in that whole record that
i didn&#39;t quite say the way i wanted to
and i forgot which ones they were
didn&#39;t have time to go back and find
them to redo them they&#39;re not out of
keys so they don&#39;t
no one else knows it i&#39;m the only one
who personally knows it in retrospect
actually i guess
the fact that you were under the gun was
a sort of a blessing in the skies yeah
in some ways it was yeah
definitely you talked about having
certain producers in mind the ones that
you like from the 70s
who exactly were you referring to i can
say that i don&#39;t
anybody that i&#39;m naming i don&#39;t know
that they will burn out or whatever okay
because i&#39;ve never met any of these
people well first off you get interested
in my lag but he wants a million dollars
you know and he&#39;s busy anyway roy thomas
baker is supposed to be just kind of a
i&#39;m really looking forward to meeting
him because of that the guy who did uh
did all the earlier awesome stuff that
name&#39;s escaping me right now
but that guy wasn&#39;t was one of them
there were different people
it was just it&#39;s hard to find people
you&#39;d come up with a name on a record
the name that get tossed out with the
first time after discussion or something
we flew in manny from nazareth he was a
very great guy and we loved nazareth but
he was kind of like in a different
sphere than us at the time so
it didn&#39;t quite work it wasn&#39;t like a
bad problem it was just like it just
didn&#39;t quite feel right you know we
talked with post family for about five
minutes and he wanted to rewrite jungle
and something else so that was the end
of the conversation here
and now he&#39;s going around saying he was
going to produce the record but these
guys are too crazy this and that no
there was no chance of him producing
we talked to him once we did some stuff
with spencer proper who did the second
wasp tape
where that tape sounds really bold and
powerful and he made our material sound
really weak and so we just
kind of shine now too where our ep was
recorded in his studio
it seems like you had a pretty concrete
idea what you wanted to commit the vinyl
then which is
oh yeah oh yeah i mean i&#39;ve been in all
kinds of different bands in l.a some of
them exist now
where we&#39;ve been going to go into the
studio and then right there and then i
quit because i wouldn&#39;t allow myself to
be on record
and have it come out that way yeah i
have a real strong idea of what i wanted
to show people musically
i&#39;ve never let up on it just for the
sake of getting successful or having a
place to sleep
you can hear it so easily this is a
crazy song yeah it is but it&#39;s also hard
to me
i have a wide spectrum of art a
beautiful ballad with full symphony
where someone would call art
it&#39;s just as much artist it&#39;s so easy
and i believe in
art first do you know of any bands that
you think have been like held back
because you know they&#39;re really good
bands but they&#39;re being uh
rather limited on vinyl it&#39;s hard to say
sometimes because it depends on who&#39;s
doing the limiting is the band allowing
someone to tell them what to do
okay well they know you could go well in
their contract and said they had to do
well then who was we they&#39;re the ones
that signed the contract
that was limiting them sometimes people
talk about
money success as being the success i
that&#39;s second
that&#39;s being lucky and the people are
being generous to you by buying your
that&#39;s successful on its own terms the
success to me is like you do a painting
and did you get
it might not have been what you wanted
because when you think of a painting in
your mind sometimes what comes out on
the pain
is like the shadow of what you thought
of but still
is it something that you&#39;re proud of if
you can get that and you&#39;re really proud
of it no matter what anybody says
whether someone offers you a dollar or
ten thousand dollars for that painting
if you&#39;re proud of it that&#39;s to me what
counts that&#39;s what we strive for
being extremely particular about your
own sound and whatnot
i&#39;m sure it&#39;s rather vexing to always be
mentioned in the same breath such as
poison or faster pussycat
which all seem to be part of the la
blood of glam bands
yeah it is it just really gets on your
really good for your nerves footage
faster pussycat doesn&#39;t bother me so
much because
we&#39;ve done everything we can to help
those guys just enough similar in
thinking in the same wavelength that it
was good to have someone else there and
not be all alone but
in the actual approach and doing what we
want to do
everybody in this band is in this band
because he wants to be in this band and
around these guys
because he wants to be signed being
famous is second
and i can say that for all the guys in
the band i don&#39;t know where our heads
ought to be
in a few years maybe somebody you know
getting a real big uh
coke scam or something and really need
ten thousand dollars so he doesn&#39;t care
what he
pays as long as he gets that money to
pay off that debt
that could happen i don&#39;t know do you
think it&#39;s easy to get caught in that
kind of
nonsense in the music business oh yeah
oh yeah well people get their standards
of how they want to live and so they&#39;re
willing to do anything to
keep up those standards i&#39;m not so much
that way not about everything
especially not about my art how many
years have you been knocking around l.a
before you really felt
that you had the lineup you needed i&#39;ve
been out here off and on since 80
and then i was in here straight from 81.
so it took
up until the last two and a half years
to finally get to solomon right now but
we kept opening into each other you just
sort of knew
when the right guys got together that
was gonna work out or did you have to
polish it up after you well we finally
that we were the right guys and then we
said okay
and now you know let&#39;s just stick it out
together and let&#39;s start working
so we all like finding new songs and
being able to be proud of our songs
going wow i&#39;ve always wanted to write a
like that i&#39;ve always wanted to write a
song like it&#39;s so easy so
you know finally having that song was
great we&#39;re always looking for new types
of material that
we&#39;ve always wanted to play songs that
make us feel certain ways that we&#39;ve
always wanted to feel what we play us on
how has the chart actually been for the
album excuse my ignorance
no it&#39;s been going up and down between
60 and 50 for the last
month and a half it&#39;s doing okay with
very limited radio play and limited
video play
so for that it&#39;s doing great especially
since my new band no you know people
don&#39;t really know who you are
we&#39;re hoping to put out a video for
sweet child and that should move things
up a little more
but the record&#39;s selling all right do
you think you&#39;re being limited
radio exposure and video explosion
because you&#39;re a new band or
does it have to do with the music as
well i think it&#39;s part of it and the
and the controversy around us i mean
people think that every song in our
record says the word [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
four songs have obscenities in them four
songs not twelve
four and we&#39;re not asking them to play
those four i&#39;m saying
pick one of the others also that you
know we have loud guitars real guitars
real drums
it&#39;s uh guitar is not the same way on a
lot of people&#39;s records as it is on ours
it&#39;s thrown down in a different way or
even if it is
for for major ready to play real loud
then the lyrics are something that&#39;s
completely corny that has nothing to do
with anything
i mean look at okay i&#39;ll say a man that
i don&#39;t care saying anything about
bad europe that&#39;s not the most
pretentious crap i&#39;ve ever heard but
people that are talented
and they could be doing something a lot
more with their lives if you ask me
you can tell me every one of those guys
is happy with what they&#39;re doing and i
just don&#39;t believe it
well then again uh you know i find the
europeans have sort of a different
approach to rock and roll than americans
do so
maybe they get off and that kind of
stuff oh
i don&#39;t know yeah i mean it it i think
it&#39;s a scam to get
success be rock stars maybe they&#39;re
happy being rock stars but
i don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to sit down
in a year from now and go god i&#39;m so
proud of myself for writing that song
or whatever or ninjas and stuff it&#39;s
joe what do they know about me
i suppose that even if your record had
stiff i mean considering you&#39;re a new
band it&#39;s done quite well uh from what
you say about the
the chart action there but what if it
had stiff do you think you guys would be
taking a different approach now
no we just would have been a little bit
scared about how we&#39;re going to survive
i believe in myself and i believe in my
songs and you know i think
that we&#39;ll get there somewhere but it&#39;s
like this it&#39;s like the album
queen 2 wasn&#39;t a very successful album
for queen in the states
but i think it&#39;s the best recorded album
in the history of rock and roll i think
it&#39;s up there with the wall
and physical graffiti and stuff like
that so it comes down to an art thing
i&#39;m very very serious about doing
something i believe in at least at the
and if i&#39;ve changed my opinion about
something i said in a song
well as time goes by that&#39;s okay because
that song is a reflection of where i was
then like it&#39;s so easy i keep going back
to that song but
it says i drink and drive everything&#39;s
in sight well there was a time when we
were a little bit careless and thought
we were real cool
and we got away with it it&#39;s not
something we do now
or at least try not to it&#39;s not
something i would do
gotta watch slash so good luck what i
have to watch
though what do you mean sometimes after
after youtube meeting he&#39;ll try that
during drive thing he&#39;s got to grab
him last time we rented vans for this
band he trashed both of them
we have to sneak them back in the
building to the band rental place and
leave a note sorry
if you look on our thank yous it says
backstage van rental sorry
i guess that&#39;s something you learn along
the way is this basically a lifetime
commitment you think
as far as i see it like say we get into
some type of material
they won&#39;t play it anywhere no one else
will buy it but it&#39;s where i&#39;m at well
the only thing that bothers me is i
won&#39;t have the budget to record it as
but at least have my past past records
to be happy with
and i can go somewhere you know be with
that and go sell pot smuggle pot from
have a gun and a harley and live in the
and you know if i plan my cards right
and pick a place to live just right
once california sinks man i&#39;ll be a rich
man with beachfront property
i&#39;m planning out my alternatives
you&#39;ve got it all mapped out trying to
do you think you&#39;re kind of
the spiritual head of the band there you
sort of hold things together
morally you think with a direction yeah
with a direction and with my real strong
beliefs and faith
in what we do as artists yeah i&#39;d say so
have you ever had to like really argue
with the guys to kind of
get them to go in your own direction
i&#39;ll give you an example about that
and uh when we were practicing in a
one-room studio
and i was standing outside because there
was no pa so i stood outside to listen
real clearly in the parking lot and i
heard night train and rocket clean and
my michelle and stuff coming together
for the first time in a rehearsal right
and these guys were on that day they
were they were on top of it
i was like my eyes were like watering i
had chills and i was like going we
finally got
the songs i&#39;ve been looking for and izzy
told me account
rehearsal he goes because man now i see
what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you&#39;ve been talking about
for the last three years
it&#39;s hard to convince someone they don&#39;t
know what they have is i&#39;m
real good at seeing a person&#39;s potential
sometimes so much so that it causes me
because i see the potential in this
person and i put so much belief in them
but they don&#39;t have the guts to dig for
what i see inside of them you know so
sometimes that&#39;s been problems
but other times like izzy is always
pushing him with socks because i knew it
was there
and now he&#39;s really glad i did and it
worked out good for
most of us so now we don&#39;t argue so much
about material
because of the fact that we now have
everybody has a good respect for each
other and those guys are you know those
guys have a lot
more respect from right directions and
stuff so it works out pretty good we
don&#39;t really fight about material
we fight about things like all right who
made all the phone calls and build them
to my room
you know that&#39;s what we thought about
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that happening to each other
or who came in my room while i was gone
and raided my in-room bar
and that could be any of us have done
that to the other guys you know and then
that person gets stuck with the bill
in this stage of your career when are
you the happiest i&#39;m the happiest when i
write something new i really want to
or i don&#39;t know it depends on the show
actually depending on how happy you are
to show getting accepted in a new place
not just because you&#39;re axel rose the
new rising rock star or something but
just because this person
likes you and respects you now or you
showed them something that makes you
respect you that&#39;s nice
i don&#39;t like pretentiousness i like
meeting new friends it makes me real
happy somebody that like i can learn
from and they can learn from me
a profitable relationship makes me
really happy
when you feel the most frust or angered
being you know what you are
that&#39;s when i&#39;m getting limited by like
a radio station that plays welcome to
the jungle as a joke
because i&#39;ve got all these papers and
everything sent on it they play it as a
joke a top 40 station
all sudden we&#39;re the number one request
so then they decide definitely not to
that makes me mad that frustrates me
people are scared
that they&#39;re going to open up a can of
worms and what really frustrates me is
the fact that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] radio is basically
run by advertising dollars
and we&#39;re talking money okay we&#39;re not
talking art we&#39;re not talking music
we&#39;re talking what kind of music can we
play that we can get this guy to put his
commercials on our radio station so we
can make lots of money
to be there then you have no business
being in radio you know get the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out
go home if you want a job like that then
we&#39;re gonna factor or something
you know get the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out of this and
leave people that really care about
their music alone
because these people are screwing with
my bank account when i&#39;m being sincere i
got some insincere [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
worried about paying his rent so he&#39;s
kissing ass
playing madonna songs that he hates and
he won&#39;t play
guns and roses that he loves that guy&#39;s
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with my bank account
i don&#39;t like wimps like that that makes
me mad
just for the record that&#39;s just because
of the obscenity thing that he&#39;s
avoiding the band no it&#39;s just it&#39;s hard
rock man loud guitars man
a lot of guitars should get in the way
they think there&#39;s gonna be a younger
audience so the younger audience is
gonna buy
the new jeep or this kind of microwave
oven so those people don&#39;t want to put
their ads on that radio station
because it has too young of a listening
audience and plus there&#39;s not a whole
lot of
hard rock and roll you got great you got
some great metal bands
some great ones out there you have some
good middle of the road rock bands
and stuff but you don&#39;t have a lot of
hard rock and roll bands now
that are talking and thinking about
whatever they feel like and doing it
musically well
singing on key with harmonies and
everything tight
planned very well you don&#39;t have much of
that right now
we&#39;re one of the few in there you can&#39;t
tell me the rolling stones
are that way i mean they&#39;re supposedly
broke up they were on their last record
in some ways like one hit to the body
and stuff but that still had a lot of
special effects and things
that&#39;s just different the new record
that has all kinds of different things
that has
real heavily thought about commercial
stuff and then it has some really
against the grain stuff it&#39;s kind of
both on that record so it makes it a
very interesting record
as a mark of the times for me i&#39;m saying
it&#39;s my favorite i&#39;m not saying i don&#39;t
like it
i&#39;m saying it&#39;s a very interesting
record for where we&#39;re at the music
but then again this you know this is 87
has been really the year of
the crunch guitars you know white snake
bon jovi cinderella
uh i don&#39;t call what i don&#39;t call white
snake crunch guitars
i call white snake the biggest sellout
i&#39;ve heard in a very very long time
is that right what makes me sell out i&#39;m
not knocking i don&#39;t know man
i mean making a mellow version of your
song to get chr radio play that&#39;s like
so syrupy it&#39;ll make you sick
maybe if that&#39;s the way you wrote the
song it intended it that&#39;s nice but just
doing it for the sake of getting money
kind of makes me nauseous
now i&#39;m not talking about the players
especially the players in the new band
vivian campbell blows my mind on guitar
i&#39;m just saying i don&#39;t enjoy the record
and david coverdale made a comment to
someone i met in carolina
saying that there wouldn&#39;t be bands like
marley crew on guns and roses and stuff
it wasn&#39;t for him and i&#39;m sorry he
hasn&#39;t influenced anything i&#39;ve ever
i like about two or three songs for the
guys that&#39;s about it i think he&#39;s a
great singer but
i&#39;ve never sat around singing david
coverdale songs i think slide it in was
a much more rocking record than the new
it took a lot more chances let me put my
tape up
like you know how like we got our record
deal and we got kevin to agree a lot of
things we wanted
we have to do it again and we have to do
it with the whole world we&#39;ve just come
back out just like four and a half
months of being on the road now
okay and now we&#39;re gonna get ourselves
together play for the hometown
you know kick ass as hard as we can with
that and then for the next couple weeks
after that we&#39;re gonna go
with all our lawyers record company and
everything else and our management and
our our counting things
and we&#39;re going to go in and put it all
back together again and see where we
stand and what we got to do
and move hard fast because all i know is
this i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen
or how far we&#39;re going to get
but by the end of 88 we&#39;re going to have
as many things as we possibly [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
could have
because man once your record is done
after that year of touring
yeah it might stick around and whatever
but it&#39;s not you didn&#39;t do it then man
you ain&#39;t gonna get no [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] second
do you think you&#39;re just gonna have to
take your music to the people via the
stage because of the
limitations to see well a lot but we&#39;re
hoping the sweet child will have a
chance to get through
in a lot of ways you know we don&#39;t know
i think it should
i can see the hassles with jungle i can
see the hassles with it so easy
definitely
i can see the hassles with paradise city
because it&#39;s really long and the verses
are a little bit too heavy for a lot of
radio stations
but i don&#39;t see a problem with sweet
child and i didn&#39;t write sweet child to
get it on radio but i don&#39;t see the
problem with it doing that
and if it doesn&#39;t do it then someone&#39;s
just slamming the door on us
that happens and we got to figure out
another angle and who knows if we&#39;ll be
able to do it next year or not we&#39;ll see
i&#39;m not going to not believe that we
can&#39;t do it but
anything&#39;s possible you know and if it
doesn&#39;t happen then we&#39;re going to
figure out
another angle without compromising our
because once we compromise our music
there&#39;s no reason to be in this man get
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out go home
if i wanted to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] compromise i
could have cut my hair and i could be
a car salesman somewhere or i could be
climbing a corporate ladder i&#39;m not
in this compromise not at all only
compromises
are when it&#39;s profitable for both people
basically that&#39;s not a compromise that&#39;s
finding out how to work together
if someone&#39;s telling me i have to change
the lyrics of the song to make it a hit
that&#39;s not working together that&#39;s
something that&#39;s none of their business
silly question about semantics but do
you object to the labeling of your music
is heavy metal
only because people see that word and
they could get this limited
idea and i think that we play all styles
of music we just have loud guitar
which that&#39;s the heavy metal label i
don&#39;t see where
a lot of heavy metal is is i don&#39;t
consider acdc heavy metal i consider it
as heavy as any metal out there
but i don&#39;t consider it heavy metal i
consider it extremely loud
obnoxious blues rock and roll and that&#39;s
what i consider us
because that&#39;s our strongest base but
that doesn&#39;t mean that we won&#39;t play a
heavy metal song
or we won&#39;t play a country song yeah i
mean if i do a country song i&#39;m still
gonna i mean the rolling stones to me
have done the best
i&#39;ll find a girl with far away eyes far
away eyes that to me that&#39;s the best
country song
ever written rory stones wrote whatever
kind of music they felt like written
they wrote
misuse one of the best disco songs ever
written basically we&#39;re just a rock and
roll band
playing whatever we feel it&#39;s
interesting because you know a lot of
the bands you&#39;ve mentioned
like the led zeppelins a queen rolling
stones ac dc
all the bands that kind of spawned the
legacy that they&#39;re all still alive and
when i first got the new queen record
right the kind of magic
it was out like last year so i heard one
of the
songs of it and i thought oh they sold
out but i didn&#39;t listen to it closely i
closed my mind because i was so used to
their old material
now it&#39;s one of my favorite records the
vocals that he does on this i compared
it to some of the old stuff
the range is much higher and there&#39;s
much harder techniques and things that
it was amazing
i&#39;m glad to see that when i read about
live aid
some of the reviews like in karang where
the queen
just queen was it queen was the whole
no one was as good this time as bad as
his queen was
you know that&#39;s very good for me to see
how about of course the sole exception
to that list of bands
is led zeppelin he&#39;s moved on he hasn&#39;t
compromised his art
i&#39;m talking about robert plant there he
hasn&#39;t compromised his art
he&#39;s moved on he&#39;s an older guy he
doesn&#39;t know you know he doesn&#39;t agree
with some of the things he wrote about
before but like you go through life and
you make changes
i mean pete thompson isn&#39;t saying hope i
die before i get old now
you say things one day and that&#39;s how
you really feel and you believe it
but then maybe you grow past that and
robert plant it&#39;s like i don&#39;t listen to
a whole lot of the stuff
but i have a lot of respect for it i
really like the song big long
but i have a lot of respect for it
because he&#39;s being himself and he&#39;s not
compromising
and jimmy page is pretty much the same
way sure you miss old leads up but like
people go back to their high school
reunions and they&#39;re standing there
talking to some bald fat guy and then
they don&#39;t even realize
that was the quarterback of the football
team and got all the girls they missed
that but the guy is
charged now he&#39;s a hat you know the guy
could be a happy
whatever family man in idaho or
something now you go through changes
i just don&#39;t like compromising that&#39;s
just just for the sake of being
successful that bothers
me i&#39;d rather start than have to pay the
rent by
bending over and take it in the ass and
that&#39;s what i consider
one last thing i want to ask you that i
forgot to ask you before when we were
talking about indiana
is what do you think of john cougar
mellencamp
who stayed back of course one i like the
fact that he has the balls to go back
and live in indiana
rather than live where all of the other
people in the industry would think he&#39;s
he&#39;s doing what he wants to do and he&#39;s
being true to the people he grew up with
that&#39;s real important to me because i
have strong friends in indiana too
i don&#39;t necessarily like the place
because there&#39;s not a whole lot to do i
like some of the scenery there&#39;s not a
whole lot to do there though
and i don&#39;t get along with the law there
i get thrown in jail all the time and
usually it&#39;s for something i didn&#39;t do
so then i have to pay lawyer fees and if
i get my way out of court that&#39;s
happened more than that
the album is the album called scarecrow
or the last one
uh i think there was there was one
before that yeah
that&#39;s a phenomenal record whether i&#39;m
totally into it you know it&#39;s whether
where my head&#39;s at all the time there&#39;s
different times i can sit down and hear
one of those songs and go yeah
there&#39;s other times when john cougar&#39;s
the last thing i want to hear it&#39;s not
like it&#39;s my very very favorite thing
but he&#39;s a good artist i guess i got
what i need to know then
thanks a lot excellent you know let me
say one more thing
if this comes out before we get there
man we&#39;re gonna tear that place up
we are we are so excited me and izzy
have been talking about going just
paying for
with me it hasn&#39;t been a good 13 years
it&#39;s been a dream
going to japan and playing the shows in
japan i mean our favorite records were
cheap trick of buddha khan and unleashed
in the east if you hear these screaming
japanese people
we gotta go there we have to go
hopefully we&#39;ll have the people be like
that for us you know and we&#39;ll have fun
with them and
and i&#39;m looking forward to all the sushi
well i&#39;m sure the kids will go empty
because they we can find some opium dams
and learn some some oriental girls can
teach us some new things and american
girls don&#39;t know
that&#39;s right some exact new positions
there to take back
oriental basket trips
well i&#39;ll i&#39;ll leave those arrangements
to you once you get here
all right all right well you can you
know put in your thing you know that we
are looking for these new things we need
instruction oriented
[Laughter]
l.a rock and roller with hard on speaks
oriental masses definitely
that&#39;s how it is all right
