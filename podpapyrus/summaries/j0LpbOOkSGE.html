The Democratic National Committee is
struggling to raise money. And that&#39;s
according to a new bombshell report in
Politico. And it also turns out that the
Democratic establishment is still paying
off expenses from Kla Harris&#39;s failed
presidential run. So this story is
amazing. I highly recommend you read it.
Again, it&#39;s in Politico. But here&#39;s what
they&#39;re reporting. By the end of June,
the Republican National Committee had
$80 million on hand compared to just $15
million for the Democrat National
Democratic National Committee. Now, we
should note that other parts of the
Democratic establishment or apparatus
aren&#39;t having the exact same problem.
So, for instance, Democrats and
Republicans have about the same amount
of cash in their House and Senate
campaign arms, which is important
because we&#39;re getting closer to the
midterm election, and that&#39;s what
matters the most. So, what&#39;s going on
with the DNC specifically? Well,
according to Politico, major Democratic
donors have withheld money this year
amid skepticism about the party&#39;s
direction, while the small dollar donors
who have long been a source of strength
are not growing nearly enough to make up
the gap. And look, when it comes to the
major Democratic donors or any donor
who&#39;s like, I don&#39;t know, what does the
Democrats even stand for? I agree. What
do they stand for? What is their
identity? What what is the Democratic
party fighting for? What are their
values? I genuinely don&#39;t know. I
genuinely don&#39;t know. Um, you know,
Governor Basher recently uh accompanied
Hakeem Jeff at a fundraiser.
Axios wrote about it and the one line
that apparently got a big round of
applause from the donors was something
about how he vetoed um an anti-trans
bill in his state. And and what I&#39;m
worried about is that we&#39;re just going
to get the same tactics, the same type
of campaigning that&#39;s already failed
from the Democrats. Okay? People are
struggling in this country. If the plan
is to jump into culture wars again and
just swim in the waters of culture wars
and think that&#39;s going to carry you
through, it&#39;s not going to work. you
need to address the actual problems
Americans are facing in this country.
Yeah. So, lots to say here. First, on
that uh note about the trans line, look,
what we&#39;re counseling is to avoid the
cultural wars, not to switch sides, not
to say like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s okay. We hate
trans people, uh, but a little less than
the Republicans.&#34;
That&#39;s not what Basher was doing. Basher
was giving himself credit for vetoing an
anti-trans bill, which by the way, I
commend him for, but to me, that was a
signal that he&#39;s going to engage in the
same stuff.
Oh, I see. Okay. Is if he&#39;s protecting
people, I don&#39;t have a problem with it.
That&#39;s a good thing. Okay. So, sorry, I
misunderstood what you were saying
there. Uh, and so, uh, but at the same
time, I still say avoid the culture wars
because if that&#39;s your main thing that
you&#39;re going to get run on, we&#39;re going
to run into a brick wall. Like, that&#39;s
not winning ground. And I mean, I again,
I don&#39;t know what that bill was. So,
maybe it&#39;s if it was about bathrooms or
military, whatever it is, maybe it is
winning ground, right? Because it
depends on the particular issue. But uh
but much more importantly,
what is your vision for America?
For America.
Like I&#39;m and look, protect everyone,
including trans people, Muslims, black
folks, everyone. Okay. But yes, that but
that&#39;s table stakes, guys.
Wanting equality and justice is table
stakes. What do you want beyond that,
What is your economic vision? What is
your vision to improve the lives of
American citizens? And the reality is
that the Democrats are stuck in
purgatory. And so they can&#39;t raise money
from the big donors because the big
donors say, &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t get my
return on investment. I gave you a whole
bunch of money and you guys ran terrible
campaigns and kept getting clowned by a
guy with a IQ of 70, so what am I
wasting my money for?&#34; I get it, right?
I&#39;ll come back to the donors because
this that one&#39;s way more nuanced. Okay?
Uh there&#39;s plenty of nuance, plenty of
non-nuance. Anyway, uh then when you
come to the grassroots, the grassroots
says, &#34;Well, you&#39;re not representing me
at all. Why would I give you money?&#34;
Right. So now the big donors aren&#39;t
giving you money and the small donors
aren&#39;t giving you money and that&#39;s why
you have almost no money left. So that&#39;s
not complicated to figure out. So what
is the correct answer? Pick a side.
Okay. So I say pick the side of the
voters. Now that comes with real costs
and consequences. So you have to do
things like no more corporate pack
money. It doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t take
any donor money. They could still be big
donors, but no corporate pack money
because that is by definition
corrupting. That is and no money from
people representing foreign governments
because that those both those things
foreign governments and corporations say
I am not representing the voters. I am
representing these corporations and
these governments. Okay? then you won&#39;t
get grassroots money cuz we know you&#39;re
sellouts and you&#39;re never going to
represent us. So now there&#39;s a part of
the story where you know one of the
donors said his advice for Ken Martin
who&#39;s leading the DNC. I want to answer
that in a minute but let&#39;s get
okay but I I also want to there&#39;s a note
of caution Jenk because if they decide
to go with their corporate donors the
big money donors
you have to play by the big money donors
Yes. and the voters are represented by
the small dollar donors. So the biggest
problem for Kla Harris in the
presidential election wasn&#39;t that she
couldn&#39;t raise enough money. She raised
a record amount of money. She spent it
was $20 billion on that election, right?
Yeah. First, there was a giant number of
amount of money. They haven&#39;t fully
tallied it yet, but it that wasn&#39;t all
her. She spent I think a couple of
billion dollars.
Oh, it was two billion. My bad.
Right. Overall, the entire campaign the
accounting is not fully done, but the
last campaign that wasn&#39;t even
presidential, they spent 17 billion in
the whole cycle.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Right. So, in her case, she spent I
think if I remember right about two
$2 billion for her. So listen, you can
raise all the money in the world, but if
you are
basically forced to serve the interests
of the rich and powerful, well, your
campaign is not going to appeal to
Democratic voters. So this whole
obsession with raising money, I get it.
I get that you&#39;re going to need money to
run ads and all of that, but what&#39;s more
important is to not be, you know,
essentially hindered by all of these
demands by the donors who don&#39;t
represent the interests of the voters.
This is a unique problem to the
Democratic party because the Democratic
Party, the Democratic voters want
something different in terms of economic
policy from what the Republican voters
want. But I just feel like the
Democratic party just doesn&#39;t realize
this. And by the way, even with all the
money that Kla Harris raised,
she left with a massive debt that the
DNC has been paying back. So, let&#39;s get
to that. The party has quickly turned
through the money it has raised in the
first half of this year, including
spending more than $15 million this year
to pay off lingering expenses from Kla
Harris&#39;s presidential campaign. Total
disaster. Now, an anonymous Democratic
donor um advise uh or donor and adviser
uh told Politico that donors see the DNC
as rudderless, off message, and
leaderless. Those are the buzzwords I
keep hearing over and over again. If DNC
Chair Ken Martin really wanted to
impress donors, he&#39;d go do 20 or 30
salon events with donors and let them
yell at him. If you take that on the
chin, make some changes, then I think we
could see some movement. But he&#39;s not
going to do that.
So that&#39;s the point that or that&#39;s the
advice um one anonymous uh adviser gave
to the Democratic party and to Politico.
So what do you think, Jake? Do you think
that&#39;s all it would take? Like just have
Ken Martin take a little bit of abuse
from the big money donors and then it&#39;ll
be fine?
Yeah. So uh that&#39;s the exact opposite of
what he should do. And and let me
explain. So there are different types of
donors. That&#39;s why I said earlier it&#39;s a
little bit nuanced. So for if you&#39;re
taking money from like let&#39;s say APAC
which represents Israel uh or Israeli
interests. Um well there&#39;s no redeeming
quality to that. Uh that&#39;s basically a
pledge that the politician is making to
serve Israel instead of America. Uh if
you take money from Exxon Mobile or
Loheed Martin that&#39;s a pledge to serve
Loheed Martin and Exxon Mobile and not
your voters. So there&#39;s no redeeming
quality to that. Now, if you&#39;re going to
take donor like you&#39;re we&#39;re in this
supposed Citizens United world, you need
money. You&#39;re going to take uh money
from big donors. Okay. Well, that&#39;s not
banned in anything, right? Including
even the progressive groups. Okay. So,
now those folks, some of them have
nefarious purposes. I want lower taxes,
etc. But a lot of them have good
purposes if they&#39;re on the Democratic
side. They care about social issues.
They care about justice. X XYZ, right?
So, if you want to listen to some of
them, no problem. But if you&#39;re
listening to Exxon Mobile, by
definition, it&#39;s wrong. Okay? But
they&#39;re never going to tell you what&#39;s
right for Democratic voters or the
American people. They&#39;re only going to
tell you what&#39;s right for Rathon if
you&#39;re talking to a Rathon donor. Okay?
Period. So, now the second part is,
okay, well, what happens when you talk
to the donors uh that are relatively
good people who are who are trying to
help get to the right place? Ken Martin
shouldn&#39;t be getting yelled at by them.
He should yell at them. Okay? Not
because I don&#39;t like those people. I
think there&#39;s I know some of them and
some of them are good, very good people.
Okay? But why do you need to yell at
them to snap them out of it? Because
what they&#39;re looking for is a highly
educated elitist who went to a has is a
double Ivy or had went to Stanford three
times. super eloquent and will tell you
all the reasons why uh they care about
social issues and then they&#39;ve been
trained because of the corporate pack
money that the other donors don&#39;t even
really understand, right? Or realize.
They&#39;ve been trained by those guys who
give more money to give you word salads
to appease you. And then you pick the
elitist guy and we lose elections. and
not only the elitist guy that people
generally don&#39;t like to begin with,
okay, but then also one that never ever
delivers. And those donors are genuinely
the good guy donors in the Democratic
party are genuinely confused like
confused as to why don&#39;t you guys ever
deliver because they took a much larger
check from Exon Mobile or whichever in
the case of Democrats less so these days
with the oil companies. They they still
a lot of them take it but they used to
be more equal. Now the Republicans take
more but if you take a different like
defense contractors no Apac no they take
just as much as the as the Republicans
and sometimes more. Right. So but those
donors the other normal donors don&#39;t
know that Buddhajic took way more from
those corporate donors and the foreign
government donors. So they&#39;re like, &#34;I
don&#39;t get why we send Democrat after
Democrat and they never do what we told
them to do. That&#39;s because it&#39;s
corruption. It&#39;s corruption and no one
ever tells you that cuz they&#39;re always
too busy kissing donor ass.
You should treat them like grown-ups and
be honest with them. We&#39;re losing
elections cuz we&#39;re perceived as the
status quo protecting elitist who never
get anything done.&#34;
100%. Okay. And if you if you keep going
in that direction, you&#39;ll spend send
good money after bad. Okay. And all your
money will do is lead to more and more
losses. You have to turn around. If you
don&#39;t turn around,
we&#39;re never going to fix this thing.
Every time you ring the bell below, an
angel gets his swings. Totally not true.
