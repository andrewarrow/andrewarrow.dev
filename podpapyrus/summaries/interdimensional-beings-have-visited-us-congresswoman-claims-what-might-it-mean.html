A member of the US Congress recently
claimed that military officials have
seen evidence of interdimensional
beings. Yes, that&#39;s almost certainly
nonsense. But it seems that there are
indeed people who believe they&#39;ve seen
something for which interdimensional
beings is the best way to describe it.
And I think it&#39;s dangerous to dismiss
everything as nonsense that doesn&#39;t fit
one&#39;s pre-existing beliefs. Or at least
I think I should explain why I think
it&#39;s nonsense before dismissing it. So
let&#39;s have a look. The recent episode
was an interview of the American
politician and Air Force veteran Anna
Luna on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So when you say that it operates outside
our understanding of physics, what
specifically are you saying? like what
what happened
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to to I guess break it down in simple
terms is that I think that some of the
tech that exists that whatever these
things have these energy things have um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; energy things well they call them inter
interdimensional beings I think that
they can actually operate through the
time spaces that we currently have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; she isn&#39;t the first to make such claims
in the past years we have heard similar
statements about interdimensional beings
from other people in some Senate
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You have mentioned that there&#39;s
interdimensional potential. Could you
expound on that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In terms of uh multi-dimensionality,
that kind of thing. The the framework uh
that I&#39;m familiar with, for example, is
something called the holographic
principle. Uh both uh it&#39;s it deres
itself from general relativity and uh
quantum mechanics. And that is if you
want to imagine uh a 3D object such as
yourself casting a shadow onto a 2D
surface. Uh that&#39;s the holographic
principle. So you can be projected quasi
projected from higher dimensional space
to lower dimensional. It&#39;s a scientific
trope that you can actually cross
literally as far as I understand, but
there&#39;s probably guys with PhDs that we
could probably argue about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My interpretation is that they mean a
combination of two things. They&#39;ve seen
unidentified objects in various
different shapes and configurations that
seem to accelerate extremely quickly,
faster than our current technology
allows, and indeed at an acceleration
that if we could pull it off, will crush
humans. And the second thing that
worries them is that the objects seem to
be reactive and probably have
intelligent pilots. If you look at for
example instantaneous acceleration which
was one of the observables of the
program that I belong to ATIP the human
body can withstand about 9 G forces for
a short period of time before you suffer
negative biological consequences
blackouts and ultimately redouts and
even death. comparison our best
technology the F-16 which is one it&#39;s
older platform but one of our most
highly maneuverable aircraft manned
aircraft made by General Dynamics can
perform about 17 or 18 G forces before
you start having structural failure
meaning that the airframe begins to
disintegrate while you&#39;re flying the
vehicles we&#39;re we&#39;re talking about are
performing
in excess of 1,000 2,000 3,000 G&#39;s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh Mr. Alzando, in regards to these
aircraft being piloted by whatever they
might be non-human biologics, are you
would you agree that it&#39;s likely that
they are being piloted by some mindbody
connection?
Ma&#39;am, I think it is safe to presume
here that they are being intelligently
controlled because they some cases seem
to anticipate uh our maneuvers and in
other cases they seem to um you know I I
came across an email where the word
stocked was used in a uh in a very
secure email between Navy officers
discussing their ships uh being pursued
by a UAP. And then we have some grainy
footage of weird things that gives you
an impression of what they&#39;re probably
talking about. Things that appear on
screen, move around, and suddenly
disappear. So, what might they mean by
interdimensional?
First of all, it implies that there are
more dimensions than those that we
already know of, three dimensions of
space and one dimension of time. And
second, that presumably these beings can
somehow move into these additional
dimensions and back out, which we can&#39;t,
at least not when sober.
Interdimensional space travel is
basically the idea of hyperdrives.
That&#39;s opposed to warp drives or
wormholes, which don&#39;t require
additional dimensions and are more
easily compatible with the physics that
we know and like. Yes, that&#39;s all
science fiction, but these fictional
technologies are based on scientific
ideas. Indeed, scientists have long
speculated that additional dimensions of
space exist. And you probably know that
string theory requires a whopping 10 of
dimensions in total, though we don&#39;t
experience most of them in daily life
because they&#39;re supposedly rolled up to
small radi. But string theory isn&#39;t the
only theory that posits extra dimensions
of some sort. Eric Weinstein&#39;s geometric
unity, for example, also has additional
dimensions, and he seems to believe that
they might come in useful for space
travel. Physicists also have various
other theories with additional
dimensions of space, such as the DGP
brain model. Some have additional
dimensions of time and I have a theory
according to which my hair has extra
dimensions. But there is no evidence any
of these additional dimensions exist.
Even if they did exist, we don&#39;t know of
any way that objects composed of normal
matter like us could travel in them. And
even if we could, at least on the
theories that I know of, that wouldn&#39;t
allow us to move any faster than in our
familiar three dimensions of space
because these additional dimensions
still have a speed of light limit and
inertia still exists there. What I&#39;m
saying is that simply positing the
existence of other dimensions of space
doesn&#39;t explain anything. I also don&#39;t
see why it&#39;s even necessary. Why talk
about interdimensional beings if all you
want to explain is in the best case an
advanced propulsion technology or more
likely some sort of optical illusion.
This makes me think unfortunately that
this talk of interdimensional beings is
some mix of superstition and a desire
for attention. I really try to be
open-minded about this sort of thing,
and I really, really want there to be
aliens visiting our planet, but I have a
hard time believing any of this. Maybe
one day interdimensional beings will
visit us, but then they see the US
Congress and immediately leave. Again,
if you ever get the feeling that the
news is more about storytelling than
facts, Ground News is worth a look.
Ground News is a news platform for
people who value facts. They collect and
summarize news which has been published
all over the world. Not only do they
collect all articles on the same story
in one place and give you quick summary,
they also give you a lot of extra
information that you don&#39;t find in the
standard media. Take for example this
recent story about the scientists who
for the first time managed to record
people&#39;s inner voice with electrodes.
This basically wasn&#39;t covered by the
political right. I find this very
curious. Ground news also gives you a
quick summary and a factuality rating
for each news item so you know which
ones to avoid. It also tells you who
owns the media outlets and where the
news has appeared. Grant News also has
this great feature called blind spot.
This tells you which news has been
almost exclusively covered only by one
side of the political spectrum. I found
it to be super useful for checking
whether a story is being blown out of
proportion, ignored or distorted. And of
course, I have a special offer for you
that&#39;s a 40% discount on the Vantage
plan which gives you access to all their
features. All you need to do is use my
link ground.new/zabina. new/Zabina
or scan the QR code so they&#39;ll know I
sent you. Thanks for watching. See you
