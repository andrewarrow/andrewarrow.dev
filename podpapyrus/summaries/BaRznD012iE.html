Welcome to another I love the smile.
Welcome to another Asian AV Club what to
watch podcast in which we do all the
hard work by scanning a wide scope of
movies and TV shows out there and tell
you our amazing listener if you check it
out or not. Um not only that but I also
drag a fellow journalist sometimes
kicking and screaming in this case maybe
kicking and screaming and force them to
watch all the stuff that I have on my
list. Uh, and every time I feel like I
should cut it down, but because I know
our next guest watches everything just
like me, I challenged him to step up uh
with this solid collection of titles we
are going to be talking about. But
before we even do that, I wanted to
introduce this guy first. Um, since
1996, Dia Alouch has been a
correspondent for the massive French TV
conglomerate Canal Plus, where he&#39;s not
only the creator, producer, interviewer,
master, and star of the weekly show Leb
Hollywood. Is that right? Did I
pronounce Leb?
No, it is your voice. I mean, I could
just keep going.
It&#39;s amazing. Okay. But also, it&#39;s the
person everyone goes to for all things
red carpet and international festivals.
Um, here&#39;s a solid fact. Back the first
time I met DD Alouch, uh we were at a
thing called movie junkets. Back in the
day, they used to invite journalists
from all over the world to come to this
one hotel and then we would all line up
to just like get into rooms to room to
like talk to our celebrities for like
five. Oh, maybe back then it was like 10
minutes. I was
Yeah, we had sometimes like 8 minutes,
sometimes like 12 minutes, which was
double digits. That&#39;s crazy. Now they&#39;re
like 3 minutes and then by the time your
second question is over, they&#39;re already
telling you to get out.
And it&#39;s on Zoom.
It&#39;s on Zoom. Exactly. And and so
anyway, so while that&#39;s going on, uh
they always put all of us journalists
into a room next to all the free food.
And conveniently, I was always on the
table next to all the free food.
We&#39;re not touch We&#39;re not touching the
food. It&#39;s not I mean, ethical. I mean,
no, I&#39;m kidding.
We were eating like cuz I kept on going
back for more and more. What I&#39;m like,
what are you talking about? And so one
day while I&#39;m like stuffing my face, DJ
sits next to me and then somehow we got
to talking and then he mentions that he
was at can and it was I think my I went
to that can too and the thing that I was
obsessed about was this film called The
Host uh directed by a certain name
director named Bong Junho who&#39;s no
Yeah, I know.
Who&#39;s he? Um and it was a monster movie
that just blew my mind and I was just
like I want to talk about the host. No
one in the world has seen it. Oh wait,
this guy has let me talk to him about
it. And then to me that was the cement
that kind of like made me basically hold
on to your leg for the next, you know,
many many years. And then um yeah, I&#39;ve
beenounding you since then. So and
including now.
That was our first monster.
We had many many more since then.
Oh my god. Is this was this your memory
of of our first me or do you remember us
in a different way?
No. No. I remember that very well. But
it was I don&#39;t I still
don&#39;t don&#39;t give years. Don&#39;t because
it was but yeah
forget the movie. This was the reason
why we had to
and we talked for hours. I remember that
eating and talking about Bongjunho and
and we talked about Memorial Murders and
all these other movies that we seen and
you&#39;ve seen and we Yeah. Yeah. Well, I
remember it.
You know that&#39;s the thing movie lovers
we find each other all all around the
That is true. And you know for some you
are the ultimate like master of movies.
I mean like like to to a certain I I you
know I didn&#39;t realize this until maybe
uh uh kind of going to France. It&#39;s like
you almost educated a generation of
young filmmakers who like see you as
this kind of like TV mentor that kind of
like introduced them to a lot of I think
so you&#39;re not you&#39;re never going to
admit to it but like a lot of young
young filmmakers probably like now in
their you know second or third film
they&#39;re like oh yeah I used to watch you
when I was growing up. So I&#39;m very happy
that some people because of me are
watching horror movies, monster movies.
Really cool and really cool and uh we
never talked about in the media before.
that is my pride. The rest I don&#39;t care.
Yeah. H the other things that I&#39;ve just
listed that means nothing. But yes, you
are the M. And so continuously we
luckily for you, we have multiple horror
things going on in this in this episode.
So this is a good thing. But you know
before we even do that um you were doing
some interesting thing at this thing
called the Tverse Festival. Oh, what&#39;s
that about?
Okay, it&#39;s just happened that in a month
now it&#39;s going to be the Emmys uh the
Emmy ceremony, you know, the Oscar of
TV. Even if they don&#39;t like that, we
call it this way. Uh so before that, the
television academy, which is the same
thing than the movie academy for the
Oscar, they are the one voting for the
Emmys. They decided this year to have
like an event uh for three days where
they were uh kind of doing some panels
around all the shows nominated which is
great because for us reporters that
means we had all the talents nominated
at the same place and for a month before
the the Emmys themselves before the
ceremony we we run after them trying to
get some sun bites and everything from
event to event and we need that for us
for our pieces for our stories. But here
there were whole ear everybody people
from severance people from the studio
people from the pet people from the
white lotus I had a nice conversation
with Parker possessing I mean low people
I don&#39;t know like from all the TV show
that you can imagine that are that are
nominated they were here they spoke to
us like for five six sometimes 10
minutes it was great it was a heaven I
have like a a hard drive full of sound
bites that I can use and it was fun and
um it was a nice event televerse it&#39;s
called And uh for the audience there was
some panels that they could uh watch and
listen to with the talents and some
screenings of new shows that are coming
up. There was an episode of Talamasa you
know the an
yeah show they they showed the the pilot
and uh there was also another one called
Irish Blood with Alicia Silverstone
which is a mystery thriller.
Acorn has that. Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. I&#39;m not sure about
that. I mean, I&#39;m watching the I&#39;m
looking for the French uh angle. So,
and uh it&#39;s it was a fun experience. It
lasted three days and I think they&#39;re
going to do it next year and uh I&#39;ll be
there and uh it&#39;s great. I mean, because
they relax and they can talk and they&#39;re
happy to be there. They nominated. It&#39;s
not too close to the ceremony. So,
there&#39;s no pressure. So it was really
fun and I have a very nice conversation
with Brian Cranston which for me if you
seen if you have seen the studio you
will remember that I didn&#39;t say hello I
say movies movies and he looked at me
and said movies movies and we went like
that for like two minutes and
that&#39;s the whole interview just
screaming movies.
Yeah that&#39;s amazing. That is amazing.
Um, speaking of ridiculous, I&#39;m going to
the in-person Netflix K-pop Demon Hunter
singalong. Uh,
which I mean I kind of this Okay, so the
weekend of the August 23rd in theaters
around the world um to celebrate the
fact that this is officially K-pop Demon
Hunters is officially Netflix&#39;s like
biggest animated film ever. Um, you are
allowed to like go to the cinema and
sing along to your favorite HunterX and
and Saga Boys at the top of your lungs
and and I basically begged Netflix. I&#39;m
like, I need to go to this thing. It
must happen cuz and people are going to
hate me cuz I&#39;m going to be I don&#39;t
care. I&#39;m just going to be singing along
like a freak. And so, um, that&#39;s just
Are we going to be able to see the
Never. Never.
can you give us like a little bit
performance? I mean,
no, I will not, but every morning in
your bathroom. So maybe you can like
it&#39;s because you know that song is the
the big song that&#39;s currently like
number two or number one in the in the
Billboard charts. That song is crazy. I
don&#39;t think any human being can actually
hit the notes keep just keep getting
higher and higher and higher.
Stop you from trying.
True. That again like I said in my head
I&#39;m hitting these notes but in reality
it&#39;s probably like the neighbors don&#39;t
agree. Just like
yeah the neighbors do not appreciate
this. So So that&#39;s happening. I think
it&#39;s really fascinating that Netflix is
so good at their creative marketing that
they are like, you know what, this the
movie is a hit. Everybody loves these
songs. Let&#39;s do a sing along. And so I
think moving forward they might be doing
more of these things if if they have
more musical related things. But Netflix
always has a really smart way to like
their thing. Do you think this movie has
a chance for best animated film of the
Yes, of course.
Oh, I love I love your you&#39;re like
you&#39;re like maybe look at
they&#39;re push you know they&#39;re pushing
you know all the heads are just like
this is going to we got to win this one.
So they are they are starting
and again to to be honest there&#39;s not a
lot of very good animation coming up. I
mean there were a lot of expectation
around IO and it didn&#39;t do very well.
And I don&#39;t see anything else coming.
Maybe Zootopia at the end of the year.
So why not? They should try.
That&#39;s true. That&#39;s true. Or you know,
you also didn&#39;t get a chance, but it&#39;s
Natu is is out there. They&#39;re going to
re they&#39;re repackaging it with English
subtitles or no English actually
artists. Michelle Yo is going to play
the mom and um yeah, that so I don&#39;t
know. Asians might win the Oscar this
year. I&#39;m just going to throw it out
there. I&#39;m just going to put it out
there. Um, so rather than talk about
singing and all this stuff, uh, uh, I do
want to start talking about movies and
and it is about singing because I movies
I I love to start off the movie section
always with a documentary because I feel
like they&#39;re the guys that are always
like and we have a documentary, but I&#39;m
like, &#34;No, no, no. We&#39;re going to push
of the movie section.&#34; And um I love
docs, but I also love the the the
subject of this documentary this time
around. And it&#39;s of the late singer
songwriter Jeff Buckley. Um and so
basically it&#39;s all my quadrants of like
why I wanted to talk about this film. So
the film is directed by award-winning
documentary filmmaker Amy Berg. The film
is called It&#39;s Never Over, Jeff Bugley.
And it&#39;s an in-depth look at this rock
star who was budding. Like at the time
when he first came out, there was so
much buzz around him because of his
voice and all and and just the fact that
he put out this one album that was like
so accomplished and there&#39;s so much
pressure for him to like could do a
follow-up and then unfortunately at the
age of 30 while he was trying to like
write and record his next album, he died
and and it&#39;s just one of these really um
I don&#39;t know he&#39;s becoming legendary
icon legendary status because when
somebody&#39;s like on the up and then their
their light is taken away so soon it
becomes people like a Jimmyi Henry or
Janice Joplin kind of the the talk is
around the same.
Everyone else in this
Yeah. Um what was so special about Jeff
is that he had a four octave vocal
range. He he gained a total like uh um
following cult following because he
would always perform at this like lower
east side club called the sin and he
worked there and he basically would then
after washing dishes whatever he&#39;d like
go up on stage and start singing covers
or just and then one day he started to
like put out some original music and
then the buzz went crazy and then the
lines went out the door people were like
who is this voice we not need to go and
so Columbus records Columbia records um
signed him and then they basically found
the right team to record this album
called Grace. And it&#39;s one of those
things where people were so surprised
when you listen to it because you hear
the Led Zeppelin references that he that
he listened to Hrix, whatever those rock
stars of the time, but then he&#39;s got
this like gentle vocal that is that
references like uh Judy Garland and Nina
Simone. And so it was this bizarre crazy
miracle of a of a mishmash that was
captured on this album. And it&#39;s just I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been matched since
because this kind of thing. And so I
remember even hearing Jeff the first
time I was like what the f is this? And
like I couldn&#39;t stop listening to Grace.
It was like soundtrack for that year. Um
so part of that is also his interesting
backstory. If you really want to know
more, it&#39;s like he was raised by a
single mother, a very young single
mother, uh, and totally ignored by his
father who was also a very famous folk
jazz performer named Tim Buckley who
died at the age of 28 from a from a drug
overdose. So, there&#39;s this like weird,
if you want to add that into like his
kind of anxiety growing up, being being
a child, having to grow up earlier than
he should, having to deal with the
pressure and and and dealing with
abandonment and then now death. All of
that kind of stuff is part of his DNA
that like maybe also pushed him to write
the music that he ended up doing. But it
also with the demons that he kind of had
to deal with,
you know, as he was living the last part
of his life. And so it&#39;s a tragic story
because it&#39;s about lost potential. It&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s also about the loves of his
life, the young women that like he fell
in love with very fast and very hard and
and and then a genius gone too soon. And
so all of this is like celebrated in
this movie. Uh, I cried the whole way
through. I just like it&#39;s just
it&#39;s it&#39;s very moving. It&#39;s a very
beautiful well-made uh documentary. And
I like the fact that you call him Jeff
because at the end I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t know
anything about Jeff Bley to be honest. I
knew Allelujah. I knew the cover and I I
was admiring of his voice. It was
beautiful. Uh but at the end of watching
the documentary, we feel like we know
him. We feel like he he was part of our
life and we realize he was. And uh uh
you call him Jeff. You feel like a
friend that we we we discover and uh you
didn&#39;t I know that you didn&#39;t that
didn&#39;t do that on purpose, but it&#39;s
here. And uh that&#39;s a big success of
Emmy Bird documentary. She makes him a
character that is a a familiar character
that is someone that&#39;s part of of our
life. And uh in that sense is very well
done. It&#39;s also, as you said, very
moving, very touching, and it&#39;s very
well made. I still have a little problem
with a music documentary. They&#39;re all
the same. I mean, so
they are they are all the same. They
have to find a new way. I mean, it&#39;s
great to have archives and the archive
in this one are great. The interviews
are great and and the sound bites are
very well chosen and very touching and
the interviews are very very well made.
But please find something please find
something else. Please find something
different. I mean the the dog that Todd
did on the velvet on the ground uh it
got kind of close to finding something
different and just find a way to tell
the story. Maybe Daydream was the best
example of what I mean and the the docu
documentary about David Bowie uh which
was not really a documentary but more of
movie about his music and maybe we
should try something else. I mean I love
regular documentaries. I love the way
this one is perfectly well done. I have
nothing to say about it. But that&#39;s it.
I have nothing to say about it. Uh it
touched me. It&#39;s a very very moving
story. This guy was extraordinary. I
didn&#39;t know his story. His story is is
beautiful. Is way way way very very well
uh told. Uh but I want to find something
else. I want people to experiment. I
want to I know his music now. I love his
music now, but I need something else. I
needed something else.
So, she did a very good job. Amy Burks,
he really, really did a great job. Um,
maybe she needed a little something
else. But I&#39;m with you. It&#39;s a beautiful
documentary. If you are a fan of Jake
Buckley, it&#39;s a movie of your life. And
um, if you&#39;re not like me, it becomes
something it becomes someone very
important. And you realize that it was
in your in my life. I realized it was in
my life uh for all these years. And uh
so the job of the documentary is made.
Maybe we could expect something else
from music documentary. Now
it&#39;s kind of a weird one because
for Jeff Buckley, it&#39;s for those who are
super fans, it&#39;s that if you know, you
know, right? Like that&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s
and and so and so um and so in a weird
way, she had to also for people like you
to introduce this man to you. So a story
needs to be told in that way. and and
and and I agree with you. This feels
like a very this feels like um a
standard like like doc you know and
I agree to but it has to be told this
way unless you find another way to
Exactly. That&#39;s the thing. I mean,
that&#39;s the thing with documentary. It&#39;s
difficult. I I do realize some I mean, I
direct some documentary and I know it&#39;s
very difficult to to find other ways and
I mostly most of the time I I do that
very in a very classic way. But, uh, she
had all these archives, she has all
these access, maybe something like
little more cinematic, if I may say so.
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Uh uh there&#39;s
probably a little bit more story that
they that got cut to cut away. There may
be another angles to kind of but then
again it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very tight two-hour
movie and like it totally does what it
needs to
but again it&#39;s very good. I mean you
won&#39;t be disappointed if you&#39;re a fan.
is going to be the movie of your life
again. And if you&#39;re not like me, you&#39;ll
realize how this guy
crying. DJ, you have to understand like
literally the film the the film opens
with him singing and like that first
note it&#39;s like almost like the frequency
is like hitting something and then like
and I was like I can&#39;t stop. But then I
and then you watch your K-pop movie and
then I watch my K-pop I&#39;m going to be
crying also. Um, but I think also it&#39;s,
you know, when when you kind of get over
the emotional kind of connection with
the with with with Mr. Barkley. Um, see,
now I&#39;m all paranoid now. I&#39;m like,
should I call him Jeff? Like I&#39;m just
Thanks, mate. Um, but and then you and I
agree with you. There are certain things
about it that it&#39;s like it&#39;s a standard
documentary film. And so like it doesn&#39;t
really stray too far from the from the
the the the kind of um uh recipe of like
what movies like this make. And you
know, she&#39;s she&#39;s such a she&#39;s an iconic
director and so she has a standard that
she kind of sticks with and stuff. It is
Yeah, I agree with you. It&#39;s good, but
right there there could be more.
Yeah, I agree. I agree.
But I&#39;m gi I mean it&#39;s a go for it.
So So if you&#39;re a fan if you&#39;re a fan of
of of Jeff Buckley like me or if you
don&#39;t know anything about Jeff and you
want to discover more about it, please
check out the documentary It&#39;s Never
Over, Jeff Buckley, which is showing now
at a theater near you. Now we can talk
about horror now.
Yay. Um, let&#39;s kick off with the hit
horror film Weapons, which o which
opened two massive positive buzz buzz
weeks ago, like just kind of and it&#39;s
still currently the number one movie in
the US and has a healthy 148 million in
the box office and counting um globally.
Um, and it&#39;s it&#39;s making a a huge smash
because the the film is rumored to only
cost 30 only only cost $38 million. So,
Thank you, show. Yeah, good job. Good
job, director Zack Kger. Um, now if you
don&#39;t know anything about the film, the
premise is is wonderfully creepy. Uh,
it&#39;s one night in a small town. This is
like get your get your blankets. One
night in a small town. 17 children from
the same classroom wake up at 2:17 a.m.
They walk out the door and they are
never seen again. And so, the film
basically picks up a month later where
the town is still mourning and confused
over this incident. And basically we get
into the breakdown of of it all by
seeing it from a wide spectrum of like
different perspectives uh of the people
that are left behind. So uh it&#39;s a very
Rashimon effect uh but now horror. Um
and it&#39;s a smart move because we get to
see the the mystery kind of unpeel away
every time like a different character is
kind of we&#39;re seeing it through their
eyes. Um and it&#39;s led by a wonderful
cast uh with Julia Garner, uh Josh
Brolan, Alden Ernrich. I love Austin
Abrams who plays the like junkie. Um and
and my fave Asian bear Benedict Wong is
in it too. And then there&#39;s another
secret. There&#39;s a character that I want
to name but I don&#39;t want to give it away
because that kind of like spoils. Thank
you. So So basically as I don&#39;t want to
give anything away because I think the
fun part of watching this movie is that
the less you know the more kind of
adventure you have when you&#39;re kind of
watching it unfold in your screen. And
officially this makes Zach Kreger like
two for two because his other film
Barbarian was also on many people&#39;s
favorite list of horror films of of like
the past, you know, couple years. And so
um all this is coming from a guy who
came who created a comedy troop called
the whitest kids. You know, I didn&#39;t
know that, but like and so he his
background is comedy. And so there&#39;s a
real actually now that I think about it,
there are elements that like he&#39;s able
cuz the thing about comedy is like setup
and then the reveal, right? Then so hard
is the best kind of movie where it&#39;s
just like setup and then like the scary
reveal. So, um, the guy&#39;s a superstar
director in my eyes right now. He&#39;s like
he&#39;s the guy. And so, uh, DDA, what do
you think? Tell me everything you think
and you know about weapons.
Oh, it&#39;s very simple. I think it&#39;s a
best movie of the summer.
Yeah. I mean, I was expecting something
good because I really love Barbarians
and I really thought but it was a small
movie and I really thought that this guy
had something but this I didn&#39;t know
that. I mean, I don&#39;t know that it was
this potential. I mean uh as you said
before the premise is so well done. I
mean it&#39;s like it&#39;s the first minute of
the film. The first two minutes of the
film you have this they coming out of
this of their house running with their
arm like that and you&#39;re you&#39;re like
creepy but fun. Where are they going?
Where are they going? This is a question
that&#39;s in your mind. And it was even
better. Uh
it was very well done from the marketing
aspect. I mean they showed us this image
and it was in our mind before we enter
the theater. Yeah.
And uh the movie prolongs that it goes
with that and
so after two minutes you&#39;re hooked.
You&#39;re hooked. You cannot go away. And
it tells a story in a very efficient way
in a very smart way in a very subtle
way. Uh if I may say so it&#39;s in a very
Stephen King way. Yeah. It&#39;s a small
tone, small characters, very well
described and everything happened to
them, but they don&#39;t really know what&#39;s
happening to them. And uh it&#39;s very
Stephen King and he he talked about it
in interviews and Stephen King loves the
film and
yeah, he loves this movie
and and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s so smart, so well
written, the acting is impeccable and
the mystery, but it&#39;s very difficult.
because I I don&#39;t want to spoil one inch
of this film and because it will be like
killing everything. Uh the mystery is it
holds. It&#39;s good. It works. Uh it
concludes the story. He uh
circled it. You have what you&#39;re going
for. It&#39;s very difficult to do that and
it&#39;s even more difficult to do that in
the in the genre in horror uh because
you have to deliver some stuff. I mean
there is some gory effects, there is
some very scary uh scenes. You have to
have that and you have to have a
perfectly rounded story. He has
everything. And the directing is just
impressive. Uh very very very
impressive. It was already very good in
in Barbarians in this one. It&#39;s like um
yeah, well I&#39;m not afraid to say so.
It&#39;s like Toby Hooper uh level. It&#39;s
this kind of very tight, very uh very
It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s extremely tight. It&#39;s
very like well put together. This guy
knows what he&#39;s doing and so he
knows what he&#39;s doing. He knows the
genre very well. He knows it&#39;s a very
classic horror movie also. Um he&#39;s very
respectful of the genre but he brings
something else. He brings something new.
Uh the fact that the audience is
following him. It makes my little heart
Um did you get a chance to talk to him
for for this film?
Not on this one.
Okay. He seems like a really nice guy
too. That&#39;s the other thing.
He was at the time. I mean, I don&#39;t know
why I I don&#39;t see why he would change,
but he was at the time and a very
knowledgeable guy and very talkative and
uh he could be with us at this junket
talking about host.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Totally. He could he
he&#39;s that guy. Um and and I&#39;m a fan and
and actually he produced did he write
companions, a movie that came out last
year also? produced because he he
produced Barbarians with these two guys
Rafael Magulus and another one that I
forgot his name who were like small
horror movie producers and uh since they
are producing companion he gave them a
hand on the on the writing. Oh, nice.
That&#39;s nice.
Just a producer title, but no money,
nothing. It&#39;s just just good friend. And
uh just to be nice, he uh he uh credited
Rafael Magulus as one of the producer on
on weapons, but he didn&#39;t do anything on
the film. So, it&#39;s just like friendship
and uh and this kind of stuff. You see,
there&#39;s a family. That&#39;s what I like
with horror. Uh it works on family. It
works on on on community of fans that
are now making movies and it&#39;s one of
the rare genres that does that. The
other one is comedy and uh and uh it&#39;s
great to see that even now even at a
time where everything is money even when
horror movies are are uh I mean time a
dozen and they&#39;re not very good. It&#39;s
great to see that there is still this
community of fans that are pushing the
horror genre to a to to next level. And
uh it&#39;s what I love about the genre.
When you think you went to the roof and
it cannot go further, there is some
characters like Zach uh Creger that
coming and and prove that it can go
further, which is great.
Um actually this weekend we have two
actually pretty big movies that are
coming out. Um, one is Spikeley&#39;s latest
film, Highest to Lowest, starring Denzel
Washington. It&#39;s been almost two decades
since we last saw this pairing. And this
time it&#39;s inspired by Akira Kasawa&#39;s
film, High and Low. Loosely inspired, if
you will. Um, again, not trying to give
too much plot away, uh, but we have
Denzel as David King, the last name, a
very successful music mogul who lives
like a king with his gorgeous wife and
teenage son a top this penthouse
apartment overlooking Manhattan and the
Brooklyn Bridge. I mean, this is I know
that building very well. It&#39;s very
expensive and so I have an idea how much
it costs. Um, the king is on the verge
of making even more money uh by selling
his label to a company that just wants
the catalog. And so he&#39;s going to like
kind of throw away the thing that he&#39;s
built from the ground up and now he&#39;s
just going to take the money and I don&#39;t
know do something whatever. Uh, but then
his son is kidnapped and they want $17.5
million and he better pay up or and so
that&#39;s the setup. I mean there&#39;s a lot
more to and I know reviews have already
given a little bit more out there and
stuff but I just want to leave it at
that. Um, did you like it?
Am I putting you on the spot? It&#39;s
okay. Before before we start talking
about this one, I love Spike Lee. Kind
of do the right thing. It&#39;s one of my
favorite movie ever.
But here, listen, there&#39;s a lot of
problem with this film. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s
very well directed. There is some very
good uh u sequences in the film. It&#39;s
just not really believable. is just uh u
kind of stupid and uh it&#39;s a bit lazy
sometimes and uh for people who know the
Kurasara movies the original uh you&#39;re
you&#39;re looking at one and you&#39;re looking
at the other you&#39;re like huh
there&#39;s a lot of problem one of them
being uh and it&#39;s it&#39;s really really
hard me to say that um Denzel Washington
he&#39;s a great actor one of the best of
this generation,
but uh as they say in in the Mel Gibson
movie, he&#39;s too old for this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] And
uh it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t work. It doesn&#39;t
work. The guy is in the middle of an
action sequence. Then there is 68 67 and
he runs after Rocky Assap and it cut
I don&#39;t want to say too much. And
there&#39;s some action sequence. And no,
no, it cannot jump from
enough. But I Yeah, exactly.
I love how you&#39;re like, I don&#39;t want to
give anything away, but I&#39;m just going
to tell the whole sequence out. I&#39;m
like, no, do not shut up. Do not say
anymore to the other.
And and and the first part of the film.
What is that? It&#39;s last for like 45
minutes. People talking in a in two
rooms and nothing very much very
interesting, Steve. Except for Jeffrey
Wright, which which is a great actor.
And when it&#39;s set up, when the story is
set up, takes a lot of time to set up.
The movie starts, there is some scenes
that are like not bad, especially one in
the in the metro. But there is this
problem for me of uh believability and
uh it doesn&#39;t work for me when it&#39;s not
real, when it doesn&#39;t make feel when it
doesn&#39;t click.
It doesn&#39;t work for me. So, I left the
movie. I watched it. It&#39;s very well
done. Spikeley is one of the best
director ever. Uh so there are some
beautiful scenes. Uh for this it&#39;s on
Apple TV plus so you can watch it. It&#39;s
not yet. You want to go to the cinema to
the cinema first and then after that
will be on after TV or um so if you go
to the movies you will see some very
well directed scene. If you watch it on
the on Apple TV plus then you didn&#39;t
have to pay for your ticket.
Okay. So, um I&#39;m I&#39;m going to I&#39;m I&#39;m
not as harsh as you, but I agree with
No, but I agree with you that the first
45 I was staring at a screen going like
what the crazy am I watching cuz I agree
with you. There&#39;s something so weird and
um disassociating
from this what they were trying to
paint. So, okay. So the film is trying
to comment about class and morality and
the choices we make as an individual and
how like the more wealth or power you
get, you are distanced, you know, and
all that stuff. And then and then
somehow Denzel&#39;s character is faced with
the reality of like who is your what is
your soulmate, you know, like what is
your soul? Sorry, dot dot dot mate. Um,
and then so, so, uh, but it feels, it
almost feels like Spike kind of a little
bit of Spike, too. Like he&#39;s so detached
from like reality, if you will, and and
which is fine. I mean, I if if he if he
was doing that the entire film, why not?
back and forth in
it&#39;s a little back and forth. Um, so and
then that&#39;s that that score
that jazz score by Howard Dawson, who
I&#39;m sure is a brilliant musician and and
you know, and composer, but it&#39;s too
much. It&#39;s like every scene is scored
like it&#39;s some big sweeping like like
moment like, oh, he&#39;s walking from room
A to room B and it&#39;s like and you&#39;re
like, uh, he&#39;s just walking, mate. like
like there&#39;s just nothing special about
it, but he tries to make everything
special, which then threw me off. It
just made me a little bit like it&#39;s not
special. We were watching uh like you
say, the first 45 is just people talking
trying to figure things out and then
like a thing is a wrench comes in and
then they just got to then they&#39;re
talking about like what do we do with
this wrench? You know, kind of thing for
me. So, if it started negative for me
the first 45, what made it back up to
zero is that there&#39;s
There is a there&#39;s a showdown moment uh
between Denzel and the kidnapper and
that I think is a a scene which not only
showcases Denzel is a very good actor
you know the man the man can act when he
wants to. I&#39;m going to say this
we knew that before.
Yes. But when he wants to Denzel&#39;s a
brilliant brilliant actor and so I I saw
a glimpse of that in this scene and it
moved me. So, I&#39;m just saying this. So,
that so the fact that it moved me just a
little bit, it moved me up to zero and
then and then the rest of it turns into
like you said, there&#39;s there&#39;s some uh
sequences where there might be some
action, there&#39;s like oh whatever and it
just whatever and then it ends the way
it ends. So, uh it it it ends up like at
a like at a at a at a like a middle
point for me because at least the second
half resolves itself in a way that I was
okay with. So, is this the best movie
that Spike Lee is done? Oh, hell no. Uh,
but it is it watchable yet. Oh, wow.
Okay. He says no. I say,
well, to be honest,
is it w it&#39;s watchable. Come on.
It&#39;s watchable because it&#39;s very well
directed. Yeah.
Some scenes are very well directed and
and we have an opening and an end title
that are beautiful. Absolutely
beautiful. remember the uh the shot on
the building coming up at the beginning
of the film on the titles and then at
the end the uh very soulbass kind of of
lines on the
on the end title. You don&#39;t remember
I do remember that.
That&#39;s probably the best thing. First of
all, it means it&#39;s over
and then it&#39;s very well done and there
from this Italian pop star that I don&#39;t
Wow. Um I did not like the opening
titles. Basically, it was every single
shot that you could get from a four
building from every angle. They they
it&#39;s beautiful the like the first two
shots, but like when it&#39;s a it&#39;s a five
minute song, so I&#39;m watching five
variations of like this be and it all
boils down to that long drone shot from
the Brooklyn Bridge onto the penthouse
where Denzel is saying. So, if that&#39;s
the setup, then why don&#39;t we start from
the Bronx? Listen, the guy came from the
Bronx and then now he&#39;s at this thing.
Wouldn&#39;t that be an even more kind of
like, you know, descriptive experience
about like this man started from this
like, you know, from humble beginnings
and now we are now crossing all the way
down, crossing over the Brooklyn Bridge
into this amazing penthouse and now
we&#39;ve got that shot. That would be the
shot that I want to watch. Like that
would be the one where like, &#34;Oh, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
This is a really great, wow, we&#39;re in
for something amazing, mate.&#34; Like
that&#39;s going to be like that&#39;s I&#39;m
sorry. Watching just a building from
different angles doesn&#39;t sell it for me.
That is not That&#39;s me.
Then again, it&#39;s the best five minutes
of the fourth.
Oh, rude.
The first 45. I&#39;m sorry.
I thought the best minute was the last
one at the end. It&#39;s like
and the end. No, but seriously, the
ending title is very well done.
Yeah, we&#39;re getting cancelled from
Apple. They are never going to invite us
to anything. This is This is But anyway,
I if you want to see this film, uh, and
some people like it, so I&#39;m not I don&#39;t
want to like, you know, like put it
It was It was in can and it was a pretty
big success and there was a lot of
applause at the end. So, don&#39;t listen to
us. Go for it.
Yeah. Don&#39;t don&#39;t listen to We don&#39;t
know any better. Um, we&#39;re just we&#39;re
just jaded old people. Um, and so, uh,
if you want to see that, high to low is
showing everywhere in on screens and
then it will show on Apple TV Plus at
some point in the future. Um, so also
showing at a theater near you is Nobody
Too. Uh, where the world&#39;s most normal
daddy is actually a violent action star
of a dad, too. Uh, just don&#39;t piss him
off. Bob Odenkirk uh of Better Call Saul
returns as Hutch, a man who just wants
to live a normal life with his wife and
two kids and he just keeps getting
dragged into uber violent carnage with
like 30 people that somehow he walks
away on the other side like he&#39;s barely
barely heard um in the sequel directed
by the awesome Teimo Chadanto who is
this amazing Indonesian like director
who I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve caught his
stuff like on Netflix. He&#39;s ah he&#39;s like
DDA you need to watch his stuff. It is
it is the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know, like you will
you will love it. Anyway, um I did talk
to him recently for for another podcast,
but anyway, so he&#39;s he&#39;s good people, so
you need to you need to like stock up on
on his his uh filmography. You will go
crazy. Um so anyway, Hutch takes his
family on a vacation to a town with a
water park that he kind of remembered
when he was a child that his dad took
him to. And he basically uncovers um bad
sheriffs uh underground trafficking
weapon trafficking business. Uh and then
and then uh uh ignites the anger of a
certain Sharon Stone.
Oh, Sharon, I love you. Um this film is
is is stupid and silly and the fight
setups are a little bit bigger this time
around, but it knows that it&#39;s kind of
silly and stupid and you know it it&#39;s
just it is the movie that it presents
itself. Is this the best action film
ever? No, I don&#39;t think it wants to be
the best action film ever. It just wants
to be a fun Nobody Too, the best Nobody
Too that they can probably make it. And
so, I don&#39;t know. I I don&#39;t mind this
movie. I I think some people are really
harsh with the reviews and stuff. Um,
but I I think this is a movie that like
I knew exactly what I was going into and
I got what I what I needed. And
I I I read the same review and I&#39;m like,
&#34;Guys, it&#39;s Nor.&#34;
What are you expecting? Citizen King.
No, it&#39;s exactly what you said. It&#39;s a
It&#39;s a fun movie. It&#39;s a stupid but uh
very efficient movie. Bob and Kirk is
is enjoying it and we&#39;re enjoying it and
the action is not the best that you&#39;ve
ever seen on screen, but it works. And
Sharon Stone is delicious. I mean,
my god,
everybody everybody on the film seems to
have fun.
And uh
when something when something like that
happen, you can only have fun. That&#39;s
it. stupid. If people making the movie
have fun, you&#39;re probably going to have
fun, too. That&#39;s exactly what happens on
Nobody, too. It&#39;s not a great movie.
It&#39;s not the best movie you&#39;ve seen this
but who cares?
You see Bob and Kurt kicking ass and and
Sharon Stone. Wonderful. Oh, there
there&#39;s a moment that Sharon Stone is
talking to Bob with a knife and then I
and like she&#39;s just talking to him, but
the knife is in her hand, but the knife
is on his face, but every time she&#39;s
talking, she&#39;s moving the knife and
she&#39;s basically like slicing him like
and I that gag I was cracking up because
it was so it was so gen of of of her
genius of her and just the fact that
like everybody&#39;s game to like play this
this thing and it&#39;s just Listen, I I
want a Sharon Stone, what do you call
it? Renaissance like now. Like I I I
would like for her to come back and and
you know, stop going to like an Empire
event and then just kind of really, you
know, doing doing some kind of movie
acting again because I think she&#39;s she&#39;s
fun. She&#39;s fun people. And I know she&#39;s
doing Euphoria, so this might be the
renaissance happening and stuff, but
like she&#39;s a she&#39;s a fun actress. Um and
I think she can do stuff that you need
her to. And there&#39;s just, you know, I
don&#39;t know. It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s high time,
people. Let&#39;s do it.
She&#39;s great in the film. Bubble Denkirk
is great in the film. And it&#39;s um Have
you seen The Bear the last season?
Yeah, of course.
Is this the wedding episode with Baba
Kirk and uh and the the dialogue he has
with Jeremy Alen White?
I mean, it&#39;s the same guy. The same guy
actor, the best actor ever. And this his
range is unbelievable. I mean, it&#39;s like
what he does in the bear like that that
I saw like the week before I saw Nobody
Too. That&#39;s why it it kind of mirrored.
It&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable to be able to do
that and to be able to be in a fun
action movie like this one and even if
you know that you can do so much better
than in in terms of of the role you can
have. It&#39;s like it&#39;s a Yeah, that&#39;s the
thing. I mean, don&#39;t go against your own
uh fun. Don&#39;t go against your own
pleasure. Go see this movie. You
you you&#39;ll crap up. Go with your friends
and have a great night. And it&#39;s a it&#39;s
a fun action movie. It&#39;s not pretentious
or anything, but it&#39;s very honest and uh
it gives you where it came from.
There&#39;s there&#39;s a running theme of these
two movies though that we just talked
about. Dad saving the day. It&#39;s like
so if you&#39;re if you want
Maybe nobody to first and then
Wow. That would be your version.
All right. Let&#39;s talk about two other
films that are out. Uh first up is the
supernatural ghost film went up the hill
directed by New Zealander Samuel Vin
Grenen. And the setup is very simple. Uh
the young Daker Montgomery, the car, the
actor who&#39;s in Stranger Things, uh goes
to the wake of his long estranged mom,
who basically gave him up when he was a
child and is invited to stay the night
by her grieving widow, played by Vicky
Creeps, who you might remember from
Phantom Thread. Uh very quickly we
realize that the ghost of the dead woman
takes turn possessing the two mourning
individuals and then and each time she
possesses one then the other is able to
like ask questions and kind of like
process like why this woman left in the
first place and and but then as of
course all good ghost movies go uh you
realize that she has other intentions
and um yeah I mean it it gets it gets
darker slowly. Let me just let let me
let me let me just say very slowly.
Oh yeah.
Um to me I I knew that this was a slow
burn. Okay. So that was the thing. I
kind of knew what I was walking into. Um
and I and I don&#39;t mind this like kind of
house on the mountain. Very
industrialist. The the the the dead
woman is an architect. So like it kind
of is that kind of brutalist kind of you
know kind of setup. It&#39;s hypnotic. It&#39;s
cold. um creepy, but it&#39;s not scary. The
movie is not scary. Let me just throw
that out there. This is even though it&#39;s
wants to be like a horror film. It&#39;s
it&#39;s more of a uh
ghost. Call call what you will what a
ghost would be of of of of somebody and
then people processing in this way. And
and so um yeah, I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t hate
I&#39;m going to leave it at that.
TV, you know, you know I love you, man.
You know, you&#39;re my friend and
everything, but why did you do that to
me? Wow. What did I do to you?
No, because I knew you don&#39;t like Final
Destination. That&#39;s why I made you watch
this movie.
This felt like watching What&#39;s the
expression?
Paint paint dry.
Paint dry. Yeah. The painting is not
very beautiful.
Wow. Wow.
I mean, it&#39;s one of the worst movies
I&#39;ve ever seen. I mean, this movie
uh try to get some targets. It miss them
all. All all of them. It&#39;s stupid. It&#39;s
uh depressing. It&#39;s uh wants to be
beautiful, but I find it ugly. It makes
the world of the brutalist looks like
Disneyland. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s really really
really really one of the worst movies
I&#39;ve seen.
Big as hell.
It&#39;s not the worst. Come on. There&#39;s
some really bad movies out there. This
Yeah, I know. Maybe. But I want to say
you&#39;re so mean. I mean, this is this is
this is the second film. It&#39;s a it&#39;s
it&#39;s a new filmmaker and he&#39;s trying
he&#39;s trying something new. Yeah, maybe I
want to give it up to you try to try try
something really new like I don&#39;t like
bakery or
Wow. Wow. Did you Okay.
And it&#39;s not even that. I mean it&#39;s
totally stupid. I mean it&#39;s really dumb.
It&#39;s really really dumb. I mean there is
a sex scene in the film which when you
think of it is probably the weirdest
things I&#39;ve seen on screen because
Yeah. So
can we say can we talk about it or not?
There&#39;s just I mean wait no I&#39;ve
literally described like now it&#39;s just
in your head like what&#39;s the version of
the sex that like is
said the dead lady possess the bodies of
whether is her her ex-wife or or her son
during the night. So at a point she
possessing the body of her son and she&#39;s
having sex with her ex-wife.
So you feel at the same time very very
embarrassed.
Yes. It&#39;s uncomfortable
and like and like and like why do you do
Why don&#39;t you wake up?
Why do you accept that? It&#39;s so badly
written. Come on, Stevie. It&#39;s so
stupid. And this how please turn on the
I mean, I don&#39;t know. I mean,
again, the movie is called Went Up the
Hill. I knew from the beginning that it
was going to be like that. Do you know
what the title sequence is on? Some guy
going up a hill.
Yeah. Yeah. That that is that. Well,
it&#39;s called went up a hill.
You&#39;re gonna you&#39;re going to hate this
even more then. The lead character the
male character&#39;s name is Jack and the
female character&#39;s name is Jill.
Jill. Jack and Jill.
And they went up the hill.
Yeah. Does that make you like the film
even more or you
see, you thought about this movie way
more than I do. It&#39;s uh I mean I like
Vicki Crips. Um it&#39;s time for her to
find some other role to play. Uh she was
unbelievable in the Paul Thomas Anderson
Uh since that she has done a lot of
French movies. She&#39;s a half French, half
German and uh she was born in Luxembourg
and she has a perfect English. Uh she&#39;ve
done some very great uh French movie,
but it&#39;s always in the same kind of
character. Very subdue, very very
like kind of she there&#39;s a lot of
She has to do something else. She really
has to do something else. I mean, I
don&#39;t know if Marvel is listening to me,
but please hire her for the new
Avengers. No, I&#39;m kidding.
Oh, she&#39;ll just sit in the corner and be
like um
she she&#39;s very nice. Okay, let I&#39;m going
to make you for I&#39;m going to force you
to do the positive. They&#39;re not bad
actors though, you know, like I&#39;m just
going to
actor is great and and Vicki is great
and she again she&#39;s a great actress. She
needs some other parts. She really needs
some to try something out. I mean, I
understand that she wants to go for a
smaller indie movie in New Zealand. Um
maybe she got trapped and she couldn&#39;t
co maybe it was like trapped in that
period. Yeah.
Oh, maybe it&#39;s a really
actor strike. Actor Strike
and um it&#39;s okay. This movie is an
experience. Uh, you can go for it. I
Okay. Um, I&#39;m okay with this movie, so
I&#39;m just going to throw that out there.
But it is it is a slow burn. Like, if
you don&#39;t
No, no, no, no. Don&#39;t say it&#39;s burning.
It&#39;s not burning at all.
It&#39;s a slow It&#39;s a slow walk up the
hill. Um, if you if you Yeah. If you
don&#39;t want to see something that slow,
then then maybe this is not the film for
you. But if you want to kind of It&#39;s
like a mood piece, if you will. But like
it it is a it&#39;s okay for me. It&#39;s okay.
I want to see I want to see Decar in
some of the stuff.
Yeah, he&#39;s so good.
He was This kid was very interesting in
Stranger Things and he&#39;s uh he&#39;s is okay
here. I I want to see him in some of
his eyes get away with everything. I&#39;m
sorry. When I stare at those I&#39;m like
that those beautiful eyes are just like
all right, whatever you want, dude. No,
he has a face.
He has a face. I know, but I&#39;ll see
eyes. Sorry. That&#39;s
my face is here. Okay, just look at my
face. Thank you. Um All right. I&#39;m just
going to flat out just just begin this
next thing. Uh your your listener will
think that I don&#39;t like anything.
You don&#39;t like anything? But I&#39;m a
It&#39;s not true. The next movie we&#39;ll be
talking about.
All right. Good. I&#39;m a big fan of the
next film, Lurker. Uh directed by first-
time director Alex Russell, who worked
as a now m like he&#39;s won an Emmy uh uh
for shows like The Bear and The Beef. Um
The Beef. And the guy can write a story,
that&#39;s for sure. And and basically the
story is simple. Pop star Oliver, played
by Archie Marquay, uh goes to a hipster
clothing store and he starts a chat with
this guy who&#39;s like the sales boy and
his name is Matthew and he&#39;s played by
the amazing like Theodore Pellerin and
he invites him to a show and then once
this guy goes to the show he quickly
like inducts him into his posi and so
begins this story. Now, uh, in a world
of like Hangers On and Crew that exists,
it it felt like a more realistic, darker
take of like an entourage, better, if
you will. Um, with a really kick-ass
soundtrack by DJ producer Kenny Dope.
Um, I liked how Matthew is totally not
what he seems, and slowly he starts to
manipulate himself into Oliver&#39;s world.
It&#39;s a little bit creepy and twisted,
and the whole time I&#39;m just like, &#34;This
is All about Eve. I&#39;m watching All About
Eve, but with like with like boys, you
know, and and and and maybe even more
cutting than than All About Eve, if you
will, in a different way. And and just I
just I liked it a lot. And I was just
like, &#34;Yep, this is this is my kind of
movie, my kind of soundtrack, my kind of
people. Love, love, you know, so you
better like
No, no, no. I really I really like it.
It&#39;s I have no problem with this one.
This is very well done. I love when
independent cinema reveals some talents
like Alex Russell. It&#39;s very it&#39;s uh
yeah it&#39;s kind of a revelation. It&#39;s
very well done. I mean if not the same
kind of movie but same kind of universe
and when we discovered the first movie
of Brady Corbett if you want and uh it&#39;s
this kind of very dry very cold very uh
uh very tight again I&#39;m using word a lot
but very tight universe and uh it&#39;s uh
very well written excellently written
and as you said the the reverse of the
character of Matty of Matthew the the
fan is is very Manovich is very all
about Eve you&#39;re absolutely right about
that and uh It&#39;s a Yeah, it&#39;s a very
good surprise this one. Thank you for
You&#39;re welcome. You&#39;re welcome.
And um it&#39;s a Yeah, it&#39;s when you have a
revelation like that in in the
independent world, it doesn&#39;t happen a
lot. I remember also some movie like
Marta Marcolin that were this kind of
this kind of atmosphere and this kind of
of movies. Again, Brady Corbett, I saw a
lot of what was his name of of these
movies? Natalie Portman. Vox, I think.
And Vlux. Yeah. And uh it&#39;s uh and it&#39;s
a movie of its time. It&#39;s really is. I
mean, we have today an obsession with
the with the pop stars. We have today an
obsession for the youth with with
everything that&#39;s happening uh around
the life of the pop star that they play
with uh using the social network,
Instagram in particular, in this one.
It&#39;s um it&#39;s very very uh intelligently
uh uh described in the film and very
intelligently used in uh in the film.
This is a this is probably a big
revelation in the independent world and
uh yeah I cannot advise our audience to
go and and see the movie in theater and
watch it in theater um because they
don&#39;t have any money but they&#39;re trying
to build up a a frame and the directing
is very smart. Uh uh you&#39;ll see I don&#39;t
want to say too much but I don&#39;t think
I&#39;m saying too much. It&#39;s it&#39;s a
directing stuff. You&#39;ll see how much the
character and the face of of Matthew
becoming more and more centered in the
frame as soon as
Oh story evolve and he becomes a
I did not notice that. Wow.
And how much the character of the the
pop star I don&#39;t remember his name
Oliver. Yeah. um he he goes back in in
the rear of the screen and and there is
one moment that is very well done.
Again, I don&#39;t want to spoil it, but
it&#39;s a reverse moment and uh we don&#39;t
see anyone on screen. It&#39;s just the
camera filming. It&#39;s a subjective shot
and it&#39;s very very smart. It&#39;s a it&#39;s
directing this guy. Yeah,
we saw that on the bear uh that all the
director of the bear are really good. Uh
but I think he got his lesson and now
he&#39;s going to the movies and is one guy
to really really follow and to see what
he can do after that and he knows how to
tell a story and he knows how to
describe character and he know how to
use his camera to to tell the story. So
uh bravo for this one and uh we&#39;ll see
you in the next one.
I can&#39;t wait. I because of this movie I
reached out to the PR and I&#39;m like I
need to talk to this filmmaker and I&#39;m
guess what I&#39;m talking to him next week.
I&#39;m very excited. So yeah. So, so see
I&#39;m talking to him in Doville. He will
be at the Dove film festival.
See, and you&#39;re going to be like, &#34;You I
you know, so it&#39;ll be fun.&#34; Like, it&#39;s
always fun when you talk to directors
that you&#39;re a little bit like low-key
fanboying about and there&#39;s and then and
it&#39;s not fanboying. I&#39;m not doing
because because of the film and I mean,
we know what fanboy can go and it&#39;s
admiring. It&#39;s not the same. It&#39;s like a
It&#39;s like this guy has a has a I&#39;m a
fanboy of of a lot of stuff, but it&#39;s
more like I&#39;m I&#39;m very very
Respect. Absolutely. Respect and Yeah.
All right. We&#39;ve talked enough about
movies. Enough. Uh
we&#39;ve talked enough about movies. TV.
But no, but I need to talk about TV
because this is a TV. Yeah. Talk about
TV, too. Um we have some TV stuff. Um
already showing on FX Hulu in the States
and internationally on Disney Plus is
Alien Earth. Um it&#39;s the new series from
Fargo creator Noah Holly set before the
events of the first movie uh the
Sigourney Weaver uh uh classic. Uh and
the setup is um a Wayland Utani ship
crash lands on Earth in a city
controlled by another corporation called
Prodigy and then Prodigy then sends a
group of hybrids which are human
children who have their consciousness
uploaded to a robot body to investigate
this crash. What they don&#39;t know that
this is that the ship was on a research
uh was a research vessel that was
retrieving deadly species from across
the galaxy. So beyond the the the famous
xenomorph that we know alien to be um
there are other gross critters that they
have to contend with. Oh my god. Anyway,
so no spoilers. Anyway, so it&#39;s so this
this this uh uh troop of of hybrids that
are going to to kind of find these
things uh is led by Sydney Chandler, uh
who plays the Wendy. Um and she&#39;s the
oldest of the hybrids. Um she actually
has another reason why she wants to go.
Her her long- lost brother when she was
a human, played by Alex Lauder, uh
Lothther um is a medic on the scene and
she sees him there and she&#39;s like, I
gotta go because he&#39;s in danger. Let me
go. Um, and that&#39;s the setup. And
basically every episode is almost like
to be continued to literally into the
next minute of like the next episode. So
it&#39;s there&#39;s no jump. It literally is
like, okay, we&#39;re done with episode one,
but now immediately like if you So you
could you in theory could binge this
when you wait until all eight episodes
are out there. But I highly suggest that
maybe this is not a good idea because I
tried to watch these screeners that we
got in a row. And it is the most tense,
uncomfortable
feeling that I was like, I don&#39;t like
how I&#39;m feeling because it&#39;s I&#39;m really
like I&#39;m not scared, but I don&#39;t like
this feeling cuz I just know bad things
are going to happen as they&#39;re walking
down hallways and there&#39;s there&#39;s a
shitload of monster running around to
like rip them apart uh at any minute. Um
what&#39;s what&#39;s your take? Did you like
did you like the show?
Okay, I&#39;m very mixed. I mean, I love
what Noah Holi did with Fargo.
Yeah, I love Fargo. Yeah.
He took the concept and he made
something much much bigger than than we
could expect.
Right now, I haven&#39;t finished to be
honest. I haven&#39;t finished the show yet.
Um I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing with
I don&#39;t know what his plan is. I don&#39;t
know what he wants to do with these
characters that are pretty
dimension. Yep. And uh I don&#39;t know
where he&#39;s going with that.
I know that he&#39;s very smart. So I know
there is a plan somewhere. I don&#39;t see
it. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t take any
fun in watching the show. I mean the
monster are great. I mean the the scene
where the alien is running after the
the search and rescue mission is yeah
it&#39;s perfect. I mean there&#39;s nothing to
say about that. It&#39;s very well done and
it&#39;s very I mean I by the time this come
out I think episode 3 would have come
out already and so maybe even four but
like um I this xenomorph is is is um
it&#39;s kind of fascinating because he she
they um knows how to like disappear into
walls and like
and it&#39;s it is so funny to watch this
one kind of like incorporate themselves
into artwork that like every time the
reveal happens I&#39;m just giggling because
I&#39;m like respect you&#39;re you&#39;re go ahead
go kill these people like
the thing is that when when Scott did
Alien the first one in 79 now yeah he he
always said that he wanted to do a very
traditional horror movie in space I
think no holy doing the same I mean what
you&#39;re saying is true I mean they&#39;re
hiding in the wall and everything it&#39;s a
it&#39;s it&#39;s a slasher it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s
Michael Myers and and it works this way
it works it&#39;s a on this side of the of
the project. It&#39;s a total success. Um,
that works. Now, I&#39;m expecting more from
Honoluli. So, yeah,
keep watching. I&#39;m going to even wait
for the next season to see where is
I I actually I do agree with you. There
is a like what is this? Like cuz cuz I
right now it&#39;s just a it&#39;s just me being
tense and and watching people. It&#39;s like
a death it&#39;s like death watching, right?
And so basically I&#39;m watching a whole
series of death watching and then and
then with with a very I mean next level
death watching because when it does
happen you&#39;re like
yeah it works like a game. It works like
a video game. It works like Resident
Evil. I mean you&#39;re in the space and the
the monster attack and uh and uh which
is fine. I mean I don&#39;t say that in a in
a bad in a bad way. I mean
as it since he&#39;s done very well and very
well directed and everything that works.
Uh again
I know he has more. I know this guy is
smart. I know he wants to say something.
I don&#39;t understand the the the
characters, the scenes, and the the kids
and the the Peter Pan scenes. I don&#39;t
know where he&#39;s going with that. Uh I
want to know more. I hope he has more in
in his mind. Uh the problem is that I&#39;m
not sure the show is doing this well and
uh I know he&#39;s getting trashed on the
internet and uh I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re
going to give him a second season. I
hope they will because they put a lot of
money in it and uh and Holly is a is an
very interesting guy. So I hope they
will give him enough time to reveal
exactly what he wants to do with this.
I think the a fun show. Very fair.
It&#39;s a fun show. But I think the reason
why it&#39;s getting trashed is because like
you and me, we don&#39;t know what the
show&#39;s about. Yeah. We just don&#39;t know
what it is. Yeah. And they they&#39;re
expecting like Yeah. It&#39;s like space
monster out of your chest, which I&#39;m
sure it&#39;ll happen at some point, but
like so far nothing. Nerd fact, the
whole series was shot in Thailand. Uh,
which is is is amazing since the sets
look Hollywood and and and the and there
there will be some future forestry that
like is in the trailer. So, I&#39;m not
giving too much away and that back. So,
basically like they&#39;ve really utilized
uh uh uh um Thailand as as this backdrop
for the future. I love that because
Thailand really is an upandcoming like
place where good films, good stories,
good everything is it&#39;s like you know
all of Asia is using this Thailand
post-production facilities. It&#39;s it&#39;s a
really cool place to kind of be creative
now. And so so I&#39;m psyched that Thailand
is is now the a place that even
Hollywood is going to come out to like
make things.
I think you and I we should go to
Thailand and do a special about the uh
the sets over there and maybe take us
and and put us in a nice hotel. I saw
one in a in a show recently. The white
something and this hotel.
Oh yeah, this the Lotus white. Yeah, we
can we can probably get we can probably
get them to to sponsor us and do a whole
series a month
staying in this hotel.
Exactly. Staying in this hotel because
we just don&#39;t understand the breakdown
of this hotel too much.
Understand? How does this make this
sevenstar? I don&#39;t understand like is is
Yeah. How is this caviar that I&#39;m eating
a a star? Yeah, let&#39;s do it. Let&#39;s do a
whole special time ahead. Um, all right.
Uh, so if you want to watch this this
show, uh, uh, uh, Alien Earth is now
showing on FX Hulu and also Disney Plus
internationally. Um, I&#39;m not sure where
this is showing, but in the United
States, it&#39;s showing on USA Network and
it is the the series adaptation of John
Gisham&#39;s The Rain Maker. Um, so now for
those who are fans of the 1997
Francorcopa movie, um, this is not it.
I&#39;m just going to throw that out there.
Um, same plot, same plot. a law school
graduate named Rudy Baylor uh played by
Milo Caligan uh gets a job at a big
corporate firm and then on day one uh
not even he&#39;s not even given a case.
He&#39;s sitting in the in the in the in the
uh the the introduction room uh he gets
fired because he kind of challenges the
big boss with his moral compass and then
uh with no job in sight, he desperately
joins another firm. I&#39;m I&#39;m going to use
the word firm lightly because it&#39;s it&#39;s
in a diner like it&#39;s it&#39;s barely an
office. um where he eventually takes on
a case um and goes against the firm that
he was fired from. And so that&#39;s the
whole season of of uh of this series. Um
so to me, the show wants to be a certain
type of show, but it comes across as
really bland. Um and and I I think like
you know there&#39;s there&#39;s another good
example that&#39;s out right now. Lincoln
Lawyer is out there and it it it is a
it&#39;s a show that&#39;s like it&#39;s one season
like I one case um you know team of
people trying to figure out a thing and
um that&#39;s a better show like I actually
watched that show. Uh this I&#39;m not sure
I want to follow along like and so what
happened here? What do you think? What
do you think went wrong?
Well I thought that network TV was dead.
It&#39;s not this is like a show like the
one we did in in the 90s. It&#39;s
Yeah for this kind of time. It&#39;s USA
Network, the home of like like back in
the day Suits and Burn Notice and like
This is a mystery to me. Why did the
network Why did the the uh the uh the
cable networks to uh gave up on the
shows? I mean, why don&#39;t they try to
find the good writers? Why don&#39;t they
try to uh find the good directors? Why
don&#39;t why do they let them go to to the
to the streamers and uh and to the
premium uh uh TV? Why? It&#39;s a mystery to
me. I mean, I know it&#39;s not the same
audience you&#39;re trying to reach, but it
doesn&#39;t have to be like that. It doesn&#39;t
have to be a show that is looks so old
and that looks so so so tired and so uh
uh I&#39;ve seen this show like 25,000 times
before in the 90s and in the 80s. Yes,
I&#39;m old. And uh this is this is I mean,
great. If it works for them, fine. But I
don&#39;t have to watch that. And uh and for
me it&#39;s uh it&#39;s uh borderline
disrespectful of the audience. You have
to give uh people more. Now you can do a
show about lawyers. Link lawyer is a
perfect example. It&#39;s very well done,
very well written. It&#39;s uh it looks
modern. Uh but you don&#39;t have to do it
like this. You don&#39;t have to go back in
time and do a Gisham is a great writer,
but he wrote in the &#39;90s and you have to
adapt that. You have to uh even if you
keep the the show in the in the in the
period of the of the of the of the book,
you don&#39;t have to look so old. You don&#39;t
have to have actors that play. So, you
don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s do something. Wake
up networks. It&#39;s time for for you to or
you give up or you give up. You leave
everything to the to the streamers. You
leave everything to the premium TV. It&#39;s
fine, but don&#39;t try. I mean, at least
don&#39;t have me watch them.
But I have a case for networks because
shows like Matt Lock are very watchable.
Ellse are all like solid weekly shows
that knows against again something
different is mostly done for for Paraman
plus so it&#39;s really different and it&#39;s a
king the kings are great writers
I mean but there&#39;s there&#39;s good writers
that and then there&#39;s and unfortunately
there&#39;s people that got involved with
Ray Maker this I agree with you it
doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any passion
behind it it&#39;s just a show that&#39;s just
like ah we got a title let&#39;s just do
this you know and it&#39;s like and Mattlock
is a great example Matt
I love Mattlock yeah
yeah matlock is a is a show that it&#39;s
done in the way that shows are done now,
but we&#39;re going to find its audience
where they are. I mean on the network,
other people are watching the network in
the US. So, uh that&#39;s where the audience
is and it works very well and it&#39;s very
smartly done. Uh that&#39;s why you&#39;re
right. It&#39;s a counter example of what I
have seen, but it&#39;s the only one and uh
uh networks have to wake up and do more
like that. You don&#39;t do that. And the
Capola movie was really good. I read it
recently. Uh it was kind of uh nobody
took talked about it at the time and it
was it passed by like this but it&#39;s one
of the good coupas even if he did that
for studio and he just did that for
money. Uh it&#39;s very well directed and
Matt Demon is great. Uh here
nothing nothing just watch the movie
again. It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s on it&#39;s on Disney
Plus or something like that.
Okay we&#39;ll just check it out on on
whatever streamer. Go ahead. Figure it
out internet. Um, all right. So, Rain
Maker, not for us. Uh, um, but, uh, uh,
for those who do want something like
this, it&#39;s showing on USA Network on a
TV cable network near you. All right. On
Oh, you lost Apple. You lost.
Yeah. Oh, wow. This is the death of my
access to everything.
I&#39;m going to get guested on this.
Oh my god, I&#39;m sweating. Um, okay.
Peacemaker is on now in the on our TV
screens uh through HBO Max and and
actually I have to say it&#39;s a lot better
than the first series. Um it&#39;s almost
like a total rejuvenation. Uh uh so so
if you don&#39;t know what this is,
Peacemaker is a DC uh character kind of
like a misfit loser loser hero. Um and
in the first series it was a bunch of
misfits that he found other people who
were just as loser as he was. Um, and
but then they figured out how to they
saved the Earth. Um, and they thought,
&#34;All right, we did this. We&#39;re going to
be accepted by mainstream superhero, uh,
you know, uh, uh, uh, organizations and
our our future as heroes is going to be,
yay.&#34; And then we begin season two and
none of them have gone to like better
things. In fact, they&#39;ve been benched
and forced to do nothing. And so, uh,
depressed and bored, uh, uh, the the
peacemaker, um, makes a really bad
decision because he has access to this
world where there&#39;s multiple dimensions
and stuff. And every time you go to
another dimension, it&#39;s like a version
of his, you know, their lives. So, he
makes a really bad decision and he
enters one of the dimensions,
nothing good ever happens, especially
for Peacemaker cuz he&#39;s not the he&#39;s not
the smartest tool in the shed and so
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happens. Um, so while that&#39;s going
on, um, there&#39;s a government the
government decision division Argus that
Peacemaker desperately wants to be part
of. Um, there&#39;s a leader played by Frank
Gillo who has a personal vendetta
against the Peacemaker. And so there&#39;s
that kind of outside force trying to
like some he knows something&#39;s up. And
so all of that is wrapped up in I feel
like they&#39;ve gone above and beyond crazy
violence like the blood is everywhere.
Um, like pansexual orgies. I mean, just
the like and and our my favorite like
eagle is back again and and to me it&#39;s
got the best opening sequence uh in a in
a TV show that I&#39;ve seen in a while.
Like I love this sequence. Like I can
watch that over and over again and they
need to put it out there into the world
cuz uh it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing. So I I
appreciate this. Um I&#39;m not I can&#39;t say
that I&#39;m a super fan of the Peacemaker,
but I&#39;ll watch the show and I&#39;m more
than happy to kind of like continue this
world that that they&#39;ve created. James
Gunn and his team have kind of created
uh for for for for the world.
That&#39;s the thing. That&#39;s the thing. Uh
this show, this second season is a proof
that James Gun has taken power at at the
DCiverse. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s his style. He
does whatever he wants.
Guy is nuts. So, it&#39;s great. And uh it&#39;s
you&#39;re right, it&#39;s super crazy. It&#39;s
super violent. It&#39;s a it&#39;s a lot of fun.
And it&#39;s much better than the first
season, which was okay. But
and also it&#39;s attached to Superman and
uh there is some connection between the
film and u the TV show now and uh yeah
it&#39;s you&#39;re absolutely right. I cannot
add a lot. It&#39;s a it&#39;s um yes I could
add something. John Cena John Cena is
absolutely great and he&#39;s even better in
this one. It&#39;s a he&#39;s
born to play this part. This is this is
it. Yeah, it&#39;s fun. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s fun.
It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s stupid, but
it&#39;s fun.
It&#39;s It&#39;s like our appreciation of
Nobody Too, right? It is what it you It
pres It It presents itself for what it
is, and then it leans in and it kind of
does it better. And you maybe Nobody
doesn&#39;t do a better, but it does what it
needs to. But Peacemaker is really good.
It&#39;s actually a really good show.
Actually, I&#39;m going to take it back.
It&#39;s It&#39;s a It&#39;s a No, it&#39;s little more
than Nobody. Nobody is just for fun. I
think that now James Gun is going to be
using all the pieces of the DC verse,
including the TV shows, including
Peacemaker. Yeah. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
going to touch the uh the Matrix, the
DCiverse and the Penguin and and Batman
everything. But on this side, it&#39;s going
to be using all this to create something
that could be interesting. For now, it&#39;s
just like Superman. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s fun.
It&#39;s kind of very hilarious. Uh the show
at least Peacemaker is hilarious. And uh
it could go further.
I don&#39;t know if he wants it to go
but if he wants it&#39;s here. He can use
it. is uh I think he&#39;s trying to pull
him and and uh what&#39;s his name? Peter
Sephron, the the other producer, the
other director of the DCiverse. They&#39;re
putting up an entire pallet of uh of
characters of universe of of worlds that
they can use for their for the bigger
picture and that&#39;s very encouraging for
the for the future. And if it doesn&#39;t
work, the second season is just great.
It&#39;s just great. Well, well, actually,
while you&#39;re saying that, it&#39;s very
fascinating because they are not editing
it down or cleaning it down for a
specific age group. This is a hard, this
Peacemaker is a hard R type of show, you
Oh, it&#39;s Max. I mean, it&#39;s But, you
know, like I you I Marvel probably would
not be commissioning a hard R kind of
like uber violent. They have they have
strong PG-13,
you know, but I&#39;ve never I don&#39;t think
Marvel is in the business of doing
something like
it&#39;s always been the difference between
Marvel and DC. Even even in the comics,
DC is more violent. DC is more dark.
Marvel is more fun, more colored. It&#39;s
always a big difference. Now, it&#39;s
assumed. I mean, they they&#39;re really
playing on that. And uh I think it&#39;s a
great idea from
but DC isn&#39;t the main five of your DC
your Justice League main characters
outside of let&#39;s say take away Batman,
Wonder Woman, Superman, like these are
all clean. this is the stuff that you
know so so they are making them darker
but they&#39;re not totally dark you know
like Superman was so hopeful if you will
and and so so this but again they&#39;ve
created a pallet which if you want to go
clean you got these characters but if
you want to go super dark we got
Peaceburgger and then maybe even more up
our sleeves that&#39;s going to be like a
lot of fun so so they&#39;ve they&#39;ve allowed
for all ages
and keeping their option up
it&#39;s very smart it is very smart and and
and I&#39;m I&#39;m here for it and so like you
say if If it doesn&#39;t go any further than
just a TV show, cool. This is a great TV
show. Like, you should watch it. It&#39;s
It&#39;s hilarious.
James Gun and Peter Suffer, they are
very smart people and I know that you
met them and I know that you talk to
them and they know where going. They if
uh Warner let them do what they want, it
could be very interesting and we&#39;ll see.
I mean, I&#39;m not a super fan of Superman.
Even like the movie and it was fun. Uh
but I&#39;m very curious to see what they
can do with that in the future.
I agree with you. So, if you want to see
something kind of really fascinating and
funny, uh, Peacemaker is now showing on
HBO Max globally. Okay, last thing. We
talked a lot. Oh my god, this So, I I
really wanted to tip you uh the audience
and also DDA on a Korean miniseries
called IMA uh shown on the 22nd global
on on Netflix. And the story is loosely
inspired by a real film uh uh back in
1982 83 called Madame IMA. and it was
Korea&#39;s first erotic drama released that
became a massive smash locally and also
throughout Asia. Um it was basically the
Korean&#39;s version of Emmanuel. It was it
was actually inspired by it, you know,
and so so so there is there&#39;s an element
of that. So it&#39;s set in Korea in the
early 1980s and and if you didn&#39;t know
about the history of Korea back then, um
you know, uh there it was they were
still under military rule. Uh they had
laws of curfews, so basically at
midnight they had to like be home or
whatever. Um, but things were starting
to get looser and so the studios were
kind of like capturing this moment where
the the the the ties are kind of like
opening up a little bit literally on
clothing because um they they wanted to
make an erotic uh film. And so the the
film the TV series stars superstar uh
Korean superstar Honey Lee who to me has
the best dimples in the world. Like I
love her f like whenever I see her I
just smile cuz those dimples are she&#39;s
beautiful but like those dimples are my
favorite. And back in the day she was a
Miss Korea. She&#39;s the woman&#39;s been
beautiful since she she was born
basically and but now she&#39;s a decent
actress and and does a lot of comedy and
and drama and stuff. But anyway, she
plays Jung Huan, an award-winning
actress who is one film away from
breaking her contract from this horrible
studio that that that she works for for
she&#39;s been locked into. And then she
gets a script called Madame Ima. And
basically every other scene was like and
then Madam Ayama&#39;s boob comes out here
and then Madam&#39;s boob comes out there
and it&#39;s basically like beyond what
she&#39;s always been doing which is basic
suggestive uh uh films where it&#39;s like
oh my dress drop but you only see you
whatever. So it&#39;s more those are curvy
uh movies but now it&#39;s like they want to
see they want to see more. Um she
doesn&#39;t want it. She&#39;s like hell no
maybe not in that accent but anyway so
the studio goes out as a re reaction.
The studio goes out and finds a young
actress, a very hungry young actress uh
um uh called Shinu Jai, played by
actually a real new actress named Bang
Hoin, who&#39;s very good. Um and to be the
star of this film, a woman who&#39;s willing
to like take it all off for the screen
and then that causes major tension for
everyone involved. Um this first episode
is [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] It is like my kind of the
setup is perfect. Like established
actress, young hungry new girl, and it&#39;s
like yeah, throw them out. we&#39;re going
to do. But I watched the whole series
cuz I I&#39;m I&#39;m a weirdo and I binge, you
know, and so what you really kind of
understand as you kind of continue and
watch is that it&#39;s really about
corruption be behind these studios um
and and how women are kind of
commodities for them and how they were
used as pawns to like get gain political
leverage and and so these women have no
agency of their own. They were just they
were just like pieces that were being
passed around to people in power. And
so, uh, uh, slowly, very slowly, these
two women bond over the course of the
series and they kind of help each other
out and let&#39;s say a horse is involved,
however you want to see think that. Um,
it&#39;s funny, it gets dark. There&#39;s an
episode that I was like, &#34;Holy shit.&#34;
And then, um, I think it&#39;s one of the
best things I&#39;ve seen this summer. I I
did not know what I was walking into. I
just knew that, oh my gosh, this is
going to be a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] fest. Fight, fight,
fight. And like, but then I walked away
going like, wait, this is a little bit
more than I thought. And it&#39;s a really
thoughtful well done six episode
miniseries that like I don&#39;t know now
now now I&#39;m I love I love the show. It&#39;s
so I want everybody to watch IMA. Um did
do you like this show?
Oh I have one word to say to you
for telling me this. This is probably
the most pop uh show I&#39;ve seen in years.
It&#39;s it&#39;s great. It&#39;s very well done.
It&#39;s it&#39;s uh colorful. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s uh
it&#39;s I didn&#39;t watch the entire series. I
I only watched the first episode, but I
will watch now everything. It&#39;s a It
tells a story that is at the same time
familiar, totally unexpected. It&#39;s a
it&#39;s this this again this uh young
actress who wants to take the pl the
place of the of the older one and the
older one who doesn&#39;t want to do too
much but wants to keep her place, but
since the young actor is coming, it&#39;s
it&#39;s very classic. It&#39;s very well done
before, but it does that in a very pop
way. There&#39;s no other word. It&#39;s like
it&#39;s fun. It&#39;s great to watch. It&#39;s a
Yeah. Mercibboku. It&#39;s one of the of the
best show I&#39;ve seen this year. It&#39;s a
It&#39;s a It&#39;s something that uh I&#39;m not
sure we can do somewhere else than in
Korea. They have in the TV show that the
that&#39;s happen the TV production
happening there. There is a freedom that
is very interesting and uh and they can
talk about uh this kind of stuff. uh
they kind of I don&#39;t know exactly I
didn&#39;t know the the backstory that you
you told us but it seemed that they need
to talk about that too and uh there is
something that&#39;s happening in in the in
the middle of this very fun show and
it&#39;s very pleasurable show in in every
sense of the way this is something very
this is something very fun to watch
I mean like
the scene when she the first I&#39;m sorry
the scene when she arrived at the party
and she puts the guy in the in the pool
it&#39;s like oh yeah it&#39;s cool
the best the ass. I mean, I I wasn&#39;t I
wasn&#39;t sure. I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, should I
make him watch this?&#34; But I&#39;m like then
I watched half of it and I was like,
&#34;Oh, no. D must watch this show cuz it
is it is brilliant.&#34; Um, and it is it is
one of those things where uh I think
Netflix is kind of letting this one
they&#39;re going to promote it, but they&#39;re
going to let this kind of take on a life
of its own. It also, you know, I, as you
know, we like to talk about things that
are outside of Western, you know, like
stuff. And so, so I&#39;mma is the perfect
one. This this this cuts through, you
know, like you don&#39;t have to be Asian to
like appreciate this. This is this is a
proper this is a proper show. And I
would say if you want something a little
bit different, a little bit saucy, a
little bit like kind of, you know, uh
this is this is a great one to to to
have and and I I just feel like it&#39;s the
perfect tone for the end of summer kind
of like like it&#39;s an adult show, so
you&#39;re not it&#39;s not like a it&#39;s not teen
or but it is pop packaged.
Already on Netflix or not?
Nope. 20 seconds. So you&#39;ve got a couple
more days. Yeah. Uh, but I but I would
say uh if you get a chance, if you see
it on your just keep an eye out for this
cuz I is is a lot of fun.
Or ima.
Yeah. Aima.
Go for it.
says voila. Emmanuel says I like
um there&#39;s a there. Yeah. Anyway, so
when keep watching DD, I think you&#39;ll be
really surprised. I think you&#39;ll be
super surprised at at at at the turn,
like when it turns, you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh.&#34;
And that&#39;s that&#39;s when I was like, &#34;Oh,
this is a great show. This is more than
this is more than like a pop thing.&#34; So,
all right. We we we&#39;ve had a crazy array
of stuff. Can I ask you what your
favorite of our list is?
It&#39;s easy. And I like lurker very much.
Yeah. Okay.
I was going to say lurker. I was going
to be like lurker, but now after seeing
IMA, IMA is my my favorite
in TVA.
That&#39;s for sure. Yeah.
Movies a weapon.
All right. Nice. All right. I&#39;m glad we
got the chance to We are now cancelled
by every studio, but like it&#39;s all good.
Um but but I appreciate
it. Be a phone call.
It&#39;ll be a fun but I appreciate you
telling the truth. D always tells the
truth and DD is always my person to be
like, &#34;Hey, will you watch will you
watch everything will you watch
everything with me?&#34; And then he will.
So I hope this doesn&#39;t stop you from
maybe coming back in like a couple
months and then
with with pleasure.
That&#39;s amazing.
You want call me.
Thank you so much. This was brilliant.
Thanks everybody.
Thank you Dier. Thank you. Bye.
