remember velocity srinivasan&#39;s Million
Dollar Bet on bitcoin well today we&#39;re
revisiting that story with a Twist but
largely just burned a million dollars to
warn us about an impending financial
crisis sending shock waves through the
crypto community so let&#39;s find out what
this means for the economy the world of
decentralized finance and the future of
web 3 Balaji srinivasan a Stanford PhD
turned prominent Tech entrepreneur
burned a whopping million dollars to
send an unmistakable message about the
potential Global Fiat crisis he says
governments are sweeping it under the
rug as they have done in the past but
this recent bold move forces us to pay
attention so why did he take on such an
absurd bet and burn a colossal sum of
money well he wanted to warn us about
the trillions that might be printed to
bail out Industries in response to a
storm of economic crises this Reckless
printing he argues could further erode
trust in the U.S financial system and
cause a currency crisis like we&#39;ve never
seen before as the world of traditional
Finance teachers on the brink web3
decentralization and alternative digital
asset classes like cryptocurrencies
become increasingly critical
decentralized Finance offers an
alternative to centralized systems
giving us more control transparency and
resilience in the face of such a
potential economic upheaval Balaji has
long argued that cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin can provide a hedge against
inflation and the risks associated with
Fiat currencies they act as lifeboats in
a sea of financial uncertainty and as
the remaining trust in the traditional
system wanes their importance only grows
he argues and what does erosion of trust
and a Fiat crisis mean well a potential
Fiat crisis especially if the scale
Balaji is warning us off could trigger
an accelerated shift towards
decentralized Financial systems people
could turn to web 3 in cryptocurrencies
as they lose faith in Banks and
governments accelerating their adoption
and solidifying their place in the
financial landscape Balaji asks his
audience when they think the Fiat crisis
will kick off his opinion is that the
the U.S has a 10 chance of defaulting in
months a 70 chance in years a 19 chance
in decades and just a one percent chance
of making it to centuries whether that
default is explicit via something like
the debt ceiling or more likely implicit
via money printing he adds that a 10
chance of default is very high and he&#39;s
not the only one because Larry Summers
the former head of the U.S treasury
thinks it&#39;s two to three percent in
months now it could be argued as Balaji
has in the past but now is the time to
get involved to learn about web3 and
position yourself for the potential
changes that he talks about for updates
