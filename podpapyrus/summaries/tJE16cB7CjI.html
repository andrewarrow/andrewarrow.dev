Hi guys, it&#39;s Mark Zikree, Mr. Sci-Fi,
also known as Mark Zikree of Space
Command. And the other day I taught an
executive producer class, a supermentors
class with some amazing guests including
Rock Neil Bannon who created Farscape,
Alienation, Sequest, Defiance, Steven
Galloway, the senior editor of the
Hollywood Reporter, and um Eric Kaplan,
who&#39;s executive producer of The Big Bang
Theory and won an Emmy for Futurramama.
But additionally, we had Nicholas Meyer.
Now, Nicholas Meyer is currently a
writer producer on Star Trek Discovery,
the new Star Trek series that will be
coming out shortly. And he couldn&#39;t talk
about that, but he&#39;s also the brilliant
writer of The 7% Solution. Wrote and
directed Time After Time, a wonderful
film. Uh also directed The Day After. I
I don&#39;t recall if he wrote that as well.
He may well have. And um and also was a
writer uh on Star Trek 4, The Voyage
Home, writer director on Star Trek 6,
The Undiscovered Country. But more than
that, he was the uncredited writer and
the writer and the director who was
credited with Star Trek 2: The Wrath of
Khan, one of my favorite movies. Now,
um, he he took a few minutes and he
talked about directing William Shatner
and Ricardo Montalban in the Wrath of
Khan, and it was wonderful materials,
things that I hadn&#39;t heard about
previously. Now, Nick has written his
memoir. This material is in his memoir.
So, I urge you all to run out right now
and buy his memoir, but in the uh in the
interim before Amazon delivers it to
you, uh you can you can actually see and
hear Nick telling these wonderful,
wonderful stories. A brilliant director
and a wonderful film. It reinvigorated
and reinvented the Star Trek franchise
and uh and if you haven&#39;t seen it
recently, watch it again because it
really holds up. It&#39;s quite quite
wonderful. So, without any further ado,
uh Nicholas Meyer and we&#39;ll talk to you
soon. And again, if you haven&#39;t
subscribed to the Mr. sci-fi YouTube
channel. Go on to the Mr. Sci-Fi YouTube
channel. You can watch a lot of videos
just like this one. So, take it away,
Nick. I don&#39;t want to over rehearse. I
don&#39;t want to overcook it because the
camera will will pick up the lack of
spontaneity, but you&#39;ll you&#39;ll find
things out. So, one of the things I
found out uh working with William
Shatner on on Star Trek is that he was
always sort of striking attitudes. He
he&#39;d got he&#39;d gotten into all these
of you know I&#39;m Captain Kirk and I
thought how do you know how do I bust
through that and and I realized that if
I tackled it head-on he would become
very very defensive as many people you
know understandably
um but I did understand that he got
better when he when he stopped doing
that how to stop him from doing that was
getting him to be bored with what he was
doing And when he was bored, he let down
his guard and he just and other things
came to the four because he he wasn&#39;t he
wasn&#39;t posturing. And what was
interesting is to go from working with
him in the same movie with Montban. And
Montban is a great actor, was a great
great actor, wasted like like most
actors. And and he came in and we were
doing a a six-page
sequence, which was his initial sequence
in the movie. And he was the only actor
with whom I didn&#39;t get to rehearse
because he was doing his television
show. I gave him a copy of Moby Dick. I
said read this and you&#39;ll and he he came
on set with and he was letter perfect
and I had this idea because I think the
poor actors it&#39;s always cut cut it&#39;s
always citus interrupt us and what about
just letting them you know this nice
six-page thing about why he&#39;s so angry
and has been marooned and all this stuff
and and I thought try to do it in one
camera move so so he can just do and
we&#39;ll dance around him for 23 marks. And
so he came in first day and every actor
by the way only wants to know one thing
about the director.
Is he crazy?
How crazy?
Do I have to pull the boat over the
mountain? Am I going to live? You know,
and there may be a lot of ways in which
they&#39;re asking that question,
but they&#39;re asking it.
and he didn&#39;t know me. He&#39;s very very
courteous man, very very gentleman,
courtly I think. Came in
letter perfect for these six patients.
Hit every mark. Boom boom boom boom
boom. And he was screaming the whole
thing at the top of his lungs. It was
just like whoa. And everybody was
standing there. And I&#39;m thinking this is
the second movie I&#39;ve ever directed.
This man, if we just typed up his
credits, are taller than I am. You know,
it&#39;s a long list. What is he going to do
if I start telling him things?
And I I really didn&#39;t know.
So, I said, &#34;Okay, well, now they
they&#39;re going to do their lighting.
Let&#39;s go back in your trailer and we
can, you know, chat a little bit about
the character.&#34;
And I went in there and he&#39;s sitting
opaquely waiting.
And uh
I said, you know,
Lawrence Olivier once said that an actor
should never show an audience his top
because once you show your top, they
know you got no place else to go.
And he looks at me, he goes, &#34;Oh,
you&#39;re going to direct me.&#34;
He said, &#34;That&#39;s really good. I need
direction. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing
up there.&#34; And then he started to tell
me stories about Mvin Loy and all these
other directors they work with who would
say to him, &#34;Ricardo, make it a good
scene.&#34; Oh. And so we evolved a a
collaboration. And I always begin by
when I&#39;m interviewing people to work on
a movie or something, I say, &#34;Look, I
know nothing. I&#39;m an idiot. So, you have
to A tell me and pick the best people.
And B, you have to not mind telling me.
And C,
you can&#39;t go RA mad if I still want to
do it my way. I I you know, I reserve
the right to say no. I don&#39;t claim
omniscience. I need all the help I can
get. I want the best cinematographer. I
want the best editor.
But don&#39;t forget, you know, I&#39;m the I&#39;m
the director of it. And if you can live
with my ignorance next to your
expertise, it&#39;ll work. And meanwhile
trying to be as ingratiating and make
them like me, which is easy because I
tend to like, you know, most people
unless unless you&#39;re Yeah. How many
people here are registered to vote? How
many How many people register to vote?
To vote. Yeah. Okay. By the way, that
was the best answer ever. Yeah. But but
I but I had a question. I had a question
off what you said. So you had you said
that once Shader got bored, you could
get him off his tricks. So how did you
go about getting him to be bored? We
just kept doing it again and again. Um
which is goes back to breast the breast
strategy with his actors. Was that is
that very similar? Yeah, it was I and I
remember the moment when I discovered it
is branded in my
he had a line and the line was here it
comes and it&#39;s like his sneaky thing
that he&#39;s doing to the other guy. Mhm.
And the first time he said it, he said,
&#34;Here it comes.&#34; And I thought, &#34;Wait,
wait, Bill, this guy is a really smart
guy. He&#39;s going to know. It&#39;s your
sarcasm is dripping off the lens here.
Let me get that.&#34; Um, and I said, &#34;Let&#39;s
let&#39;s do it again.&#34; And it came off
again very heavy-handed.
And I said, &#34;You know what? That wasn&#39;t
good for sound, was it?&#34; Uh,
and we just kept doing it and finally
what you see is in the movie and that&#39;s
the way the rest of the performance was
more or less
wow got it just and after a while he
sort of knew what I was doing and he
just, you know, he started being less
defensive about the role and himself as
the star and captain and he got more
into what the movie was about which was
about a man getting old and losing his
friends. You know, you say you don&#39;t
like science fiction, but where does
what is science fiction and at what
point does the human component of it
become more important? Any science
fiction movie I always made was always
set on planet Earth right here, right
now, no matter what they were wearing.
