Welcome back everybody to another boot
smoking episode of Lockdown 23 in One.
That&#39;s right, a kidnapper is going to be
getting his boot smoked for sure today.
What exactly is getting your boot
smoked? A lot of people might be asking.
It&#39;s a term, a hypothetical term that
inmates used to use on other inmates
that came out of the courtroom and got
more time than expected. We would say to
them, &#34;Man, your state boots got smoked,
didn&#39;t they?&#34; Meaning, you got a lot of
time in prison, man. It&#39;s kind of like
pouring salt on a wound. Get a couple
good laughs from the other inmates. But
of course, you know, some people they
pick and choose. They got a real killer
or a high up gang member coming into the
tank after getting sentenced to a lot of
time. If someone were to say to them,
&#34;Man, you got smoke.&#34; Chances are it be
his death wish. So, you know, inmates
pick and choose who to pour salt on the
wounds too. But that&#39;s where the whole
hypothetical smoke phrase comes from for
anybody that doesn&#39;t know. Anyways, the
defendant, like I said, is going to be
sentenced for kidnap along with a couple
other charges. Not to mention, he&#39;s
completely shocked by the amount of time
he gets, which blows my mind. But of
course, before we get into all that, if
you&#39;re new to the channel and enjoy all
things lock up and crime related, then
this is where you want to be. Hit that
like, subscribe, notification bell
before you leave and check out my
beautifully assorted playlist with many
more videos for you to start watching
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, your honor, I have reviewed the
presentence report as well as the
additional evaluations that were
conducted in regards to this matter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. Before we get to the
sentencing, I want to read the uh
explanation of duties to register to Mr.
Wyatt and ask him to place his signature
on it indicating that he&#39;s been advised
of uh these duties. The county of
conviction is Lake. In other words, I
believe he&#39;s being registered as a sex
offender. Also, I asked a question in
the last one. How do sex offenders have
to register? You know, how do people
know who&#39;s who moving into your
neighborhood? Right? Someone said that
they uh let people know through mail and
I heard other things, but I&#39;ve never
seen it not once in my life. And I&#39;ve
done the apps where you can search the
people around you if they&#39;ve got any
crimes like that and they&#39;re all around
me. I&#39;ve never gotten a letter not once.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 23 CR047
conviction under uh
gross sexual imposition. Paul A. Wyatt
III. You&#39;ve been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a sexually oriented offense
as defined in 2950.01
and you are a two-tier sex offender. You
are required to register in person with
the sheriff of the county in which you
establish residency within 3 days of
coming into that county or if temporary
doiciled for more than 3 days. You&#39;re
also required to register in person with
the sheriff of the county in which you
establish a place of education
immediately upon coming into that
county. If you establish a place of
education in another state but maintain
a residence or temporary doicile here,
you&#39;re also required to register in
person with the sheriff or other
appropriate official in that other state
immediately upon coming into that state.
You are also required to register in
person with the sheriff of the county in
which you establish a place of
employment. If you have been employed
for more than three days or for an
aggregate of 14 days in a calendar year,
if you establish place of employment in
another state but maintain a residence
or temporary doicile here, you are also
required to register in person with the
sheriff or other appropriate official in
that other state. If you have been
employed for more than 3 days or for an
aggregate of 14 days in a calendar year,
employment includes volunteer services.
You are required to provide proof to the
sheriff temporary u lodging information
including the address and length of stay
if your absence will be for 7 days or
more. After the date of initial
registration, you are required to to
periodically verify your residence
address, place of employment, and or
place of education in person at the
county sheriff&#39;s office no no earlier
than 10 days prior to your verification
date. So, as you can see, a registered
sex offender has a whole another bracket
of rules and regulations they got to
follow. And almost guarantee when they
get out, they&#39;re going to be on
probation or parole as well, which is a
whole another list of rules and
regulations they got to follow. He&#39;s got
his work cut out for him when he&#39;s
released, if he&#39;s released. Now, I know
this guy&#39;s in here for kidnapping, but I
have no idea how much time he&#39;s going to
get. A lot of people are hearing these
things of what he&#39;s got to do when he
gets out and is thinking that maybe he&#39;s
going to be getting out soon. Even the
defendants think like that sometimes. I
remember they were talking about
probation and all this, that, and the
third. I thought I was going home one
day. Reinstated. Think again. Man, I
went right back to prison. So, even
though they&#39;re talking about the steps
of what you&#39;re going to do when you&#39;re
released, sometimes these guys ain&#39;t
released for 70 years later. They&#39;re
going to forget every word that judge
said. But this guy&#39;s got kidnapped. And
in most states, that runs about 25 to 50
years in prison. Failure to register,
fail to verify residence of at specified
times, or failure to provide notice of a
change in residence address or other
required information as described above
will result in criminal prosecution.
The next uh line says, you acknowledge
the above requirements have been
explained to you and that you must abide
by all the provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code Chapter 2950. Mr. Uh
Okconor, if you could have your client
sign on uh signature line below line 11,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. So, we got the attorney about
to speak on the behalf of the defendant.
And usually, typically, they do the same
thing, you know, with individuals that
are guilty. They try to show the good
things that he&#39;s done or explain reasons
on why he done these things, maybe a
past childhood event, you know,
something to kind of possibly lighten or
soften up the judge to give them a
better sentencing. I mean, how can you
defend a defendant if they&#39;re guilty?
100%, right? It&#39;s kind of tough. So,
just take that into consideration with
some of these guys and cut them some
slack, man. They ain&#39;t got much to work
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. As to the sentencing hearing,
Mr. Okconor, go ahead.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, your honor.
Your honor, in regards to sentencing,
um, as court aware, there are certain
factors the court has to consider in
determining what is the appropriate
sentence here. Uh, in particular, there
are certain factors we&#39;d ask the court
to consider. um is that there&#39;s s
substantial grounds in regards to
mitigation. Uh we understand that uh
this mitigation is not a defense. It
doesn&#39;t make his actions right. Uh but
we think it&#39;s important in knowing Mr.
Wyatt in his past uh in regards to his
substance use. Um Mr. Wyatt was raised
by his parental grandmother for most of
his life as a cop child. He lost his
grandmother when he was 13. that had a
very dramatic impact on his health from
there in which um as a teenager not
knowing how to deal with stress, how to
deal with loss, he turns to substance
use. Uh he in the PSR and with Dr.
Rinsburg, one can see as he talks about
it um how over time he began to let
substance use control his life. He used
to be active in sports, was potentially
looking at college, and by the time he
graduated, he was barely able to do so
and was no longer pursuing any career in
supports. Um, ultimately, his substance
use got him in trouble in Kyahoga County
initially. They did consider him for a
diversion program there. Um, however, he
was in need of help, more serious help.
And ultimately when he picked up charges
the next year, uh he was sentenced to 5
years in prison.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; U during this time,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so he&#39;s already done 5 years in prison.
Look, whenever a judge hears that, it
makes the sentencing much easier because
you&#39;ve been to prison. You ain&#39;t learned
your lesson. But just like I said, the
defense attorney&#39;s pretty much given out
a bunch of sweet nothings. This guy&#39;s
story is just like many others, man.
Barely graduated high school, man. had a
lot going for him in sports and ended up
taking the dirty, filthy drug route,
right? And all your hopes and dreams
disappear. So, take it from me and this
guy, you know, uh, make the right
choices while you&#39;re young because the
wrong one could send a ripple in that
pond called time that could last
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s been clear to myself to probation,
to Dr. Rinsburg to probation, um, that
he needs help and he knows he needs
help. um the day of the offense um due
to the fact that he had still obviously
not addressed his substance use um he
smoked a joint uh once he was lost in
pain ill um and was not of right mind
when this all occurred. Um it doesn&#39;t
make what happened that day okay and he
recognizes that and he will never try to
say it makes it okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right, I got to stop it right here
right now. He said a J-bird caused him
not to be in the right state of mind.
Hell no. Yeah, he was in the wrong state
of mind to begin with. I can almost
guarantee he already planned and plotted
what he was going to do while he was
sober and smoked that J-bird before he
did it as a little sprinkle to his
dessert type of thing. But before we
move forward, man, I got to get this
done and over with. A quick courtroom
analysis. Oh my lucky stars. The trim
and furniture in this courtroom is made
from some of the rarest oak in
Tennessee. Coming straight from the
secret city itself of Oakidge, this is
sandpost oak or corus geminata. It has
been designated as a species of special
concern in Tennessee. Efforts are
underway to conserve it, including
collecting scions, branch tips for
grafting onto other post oak rootstock.
Sandpost oak is durable, decay
resistant. The acorns produced on this
tree are nutrient food source for
animals like deer, turkeys, and
squirrels. But to pair it with the
armadillo spliced AI teflon line chairs
is unreal. And across from it is that a
Elon Musk self-projecting projector. Oh
my goodness. Everything aligned
perfectly with the church pantry food
carpet. You can smell the canned foods
from here. And last but not least,
ordered straight from Dubai. Even rarer
than the sandpost oak, we got the Roblox
2D Timberwood in here. This courtroom by
far is a 10. Man, I love those courtroom
analysis. But look, we&#39;re going to
bypass a few things and jump right into
the defendant speaking his mind before
he gets sentenced.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, but we&#39;d ask the court to take all
of that into consideration when making
sentencing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, Mr. Wyatt. What do you want
to tell me before I impose sentence in
this case? I just want to say I&#39;m
thankful I that that she ain&#39;t killed
me. I&#39;m I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m sorry that
that this happened. You know what I&#39;m
saying to you?
And I&#39;m just thankful that you didn&#39;t
have no gun to kill me cuz by right you
could have killed me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh man, this dude&#39;s looking directly at
the victim. And it seems like he don&#39;t
care if he goes to prison or not. He&#39;s
just thankful that he didn&#39;t get killed.
Which kind of makes sense cuz yeah, he
definitely could have. And I got four
daughters, man. You know, it sucks
because I&#39;m a felon. I can&#39;t teach him
how to use a gun, but I promise I&#39;m
I&#39;mma lead them in the right uh shooting
range to do so. Even though I don&#39;t go
to shooting ranges or know anything
about them, you know, my daughters need
to be prepared.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was all the way out of my mind. You
could have really killed me. You know,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you haven&#39;t addressed the court. Your
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you could have took Huh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let him talk. I I&#39;ll handle this. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39; you say?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Never mind. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m just I&#39;m just thankful that they
didn&#39;t kill me. The police didn&#39;t kill
me. She didn&#39;t kill me. I&#39;m That&#39;s what
I&#39;m thankful for. Like the situation
happened. I&#39;m sorry it happened. I&#39;m I&#39;m
I&#39;m I&#39;m I apologize for everything that
happened. The the the the mental
everything that&#39;s going on right now.
I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what
else to say. Everything else I say will
be sounding like a a excuses. Like I&#39;m
just I&#39;m sorry. Like I don&#39;t know how I
can show y&#39;all or make it better. I
don&#39;t know what to do but go to jail. I
I you know I&#39;m but I&#39;m sorry. You feel
me? I&#39;m sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. Skim
Susan first would like to address the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The victim&#39;s going to speak. And
typically I don&#39;t bring these on the
channel, but I&#39;m kind of lost as to
exactly what he did. Maybe she&#39;ll break
it down a little bit.
Um, I just would like to start with the
fact that, um, first time, no, second
time I saw Mr. Wyatt was when he was
standing in front of a police officer,
the first police officer I saw
throughout all this, and 911 had already
been called for him
because a white woman had assaulted him.
That white woman was me.
That&#39;s when I finally got free from him
choking me because I got my hand free
and I swung as hard as I could and I
dropped to the ground.
That was it. Two guys came up and then
they helped me. They chased him to where
that police officer was. So on January
my life changed.
I would read it, your honor. Um, on
January 9th, 2023, my life changed when
I was assaulted while walking at
lunchtime and my attacker grabbed me
around the neck. He pulled me across the
street at Jackson and Richmond while
choking me and finally stopped at the
side door of Chipotle. He told me what
he planned to do and I pulled my hand
free and started pounding on the door
and screaming for help. At that time,
when he touched me again, I swung as
hard as I could and hit him in the face
and dropped to the ground. No one from
Chipotle came at my house, but two men
from Mr. Muffler came running across the
street and yelling at the guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shout out to those Mr. Muffler
employees, man. Y&#39;all built like that.
Chipotle cats ain&#39;t do nothing. Maybe
they&#39;re too busy rolling burritos and
didn&#39;t see it. You know, that&#39;s the
place that rolls burritos, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They became my angels at this point and
checked to see if I was okay before
running after the guy. They chased him
to McDonald&#39;s and the next time I saw
him, he was sitting on the ground in
front of McDonald&#39;s with a police
officer standing over him and several
deputies and firemen in the area. I was
asked to identify him twice and three of
the deputies walked me closer while
keeping me behind and then stepped aside
to let me get a closer look. I made my
statement with the deputy while two men
did the same while standing outside the
vehicle. I was so grateful that they
were willing to take the time to help me
out and make their statements about the
horrible incident that had just
occurred. I was taken back to my place
of work until a female officer came to
pick me up and take me to the police
station for a recorded interview about
what had just occurred. It didn&#39;t feel
real, even though I felt like I answered
the same questions many times over. At
the station, I was interviewed, which
was hard, but they were very
professional and tried to make it as
easy as possible for me.
I lost my voice for about three weeks
and it seemed like my entire life was
scheduled around what was happening with
the case involving my attacker or
waiting to hear what was to come. I
didn&#39;t go out much during that time and
didn&#39;t even feel comfortable walking
through the intersection where I was
assaulted and had walked almost every
day. My brother brought me pepper spray
and I still carry it whenever I&#39;m
walking with or without company. I hated
being afraid to walk again and felt it
necessary to carry that pepper spray. I
often turned down invitations due to
what I went through and just didn&#39;t feel
comfortable. It took me about four to
five months to get the nerve to walk
through intersection intersection and
I&#39;m feeling better about it now. Still
carrying the pepper spray. I was
notified about the grand jury and
couldn&#39;t bring myself to attend and the
interviewing detective spoke for me that
for which I was grateful.
I didn&#39;t have a voice for those three
weeks but I still got a lot of calls
from family and friends wanting to check
on me. Seems like a lot of things were
put on hold during that time as we were
always waiting to see what my failance
next would would be. Plead guilty or
going before grand jury. Every time I
got a call regarding him, it was very
seldom good news. My advocate was
wonderful through all of this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An advocate, ladies and gentlemen, is
someone that stands in the courtroom and
speaks on your behalf. And shout out to
those individuals because, you know,
typically they got to break down some
very heinous situations to the judge.
And I can only imagine hearing those
kind of stories every day can be
strenuous on the mantle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so it continues. Today is a
pre-trial. This is dated August 22nd,
The subject decided he didn&#39;t want to
work with his attorney anymore. So my
brother Pat Sherry and I showed up at
the courtroom and there he was again.
Judge O&#39;Donnell kept control of the
hearing and the defendant the whole time
we were there. All the defendant talked
about was his drug problem and how his
attorney wasn&#39;t helping him. The judge
explained to him that it wasn&#39;t his job
and his attorney was supposed to use the
facts of the case and advise him of his
best choices. When it was over, the
judge told him he would be in the court
the next day. Once the judge left the
courtroom, everyone got up to leave. And
as the defendant swapped past us, he
stopped directly in front of us and
asked, &#34;How are you doing?&#34; It took us
all by surprise and not in a good way.
The deputy yelled at him and told him
not to talk to me to us as well at all.
We were all shook off since we weren&#39;t
expecting any contact at all. It took a
while to work through, but I that won&#39;t
happen again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Man, I can&#39;t imagine, you know, all the
ladies out there that&#39;s been in a
situation similar to this and you got
the individual that did saying something
to you as he leaves the courtroom. That
should never be allowed, you know, but
of course, how can someone control
another person&#39;s voice? I have seen
someone in the courtroom get their mouth
duct taped, so that could always be an
option with these type of cases. But
either way, yeah, I would have been
scarred a little bit more hearing that
fool ask me, &#34;How are you doing?&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8:23. Another hearing today. Supposedly,
he&#39;s going to plead guilty tomorrow
morning. A time will be set for the
sentencing and my impact statement
should be ready. Pre-sentence report
will be done and 9:15
and then 9:5 should be getting close to
the end. So, I sit and wait 10:25. This
is the LA last date I&#39;ve received
regarding the case sentencing here.
Well, it sounds like the victim is very
detailed with the times and dates of
everything going on and wanted the
courts to know that it was very
important to her. But we already found
out pretty much what exactly he did. You
know, people get ran up on and brought a
day around other individuals and get
kidnapped all the time. So, don&#39;t think
it&#39;s that rare of a situation. But,
let&#39;s go ahead and bypass a few more
things and jump into what the judge has
to say about the situation, which is
going to roll into the sentencing as
All right, I&#39;ve reviewed the uh
pres-sentence report
and the psychological evaluation as well
as the uh past evaluations
including uh
Joneswood Psychological Associates done
in June of 03.
I&#39;ve reviewed the pre uh the uh victim
impact statement. I&#39;ve listened to the
victim, listened to Mr. Wyatt, listen to
I&#39;ve considered all provisions in
292912, and 292913.
And I&#39;m going to determine you&#39;re not
amunable to community control.
and community control, for anybody that
doesn&#39;t know some of these words,
community control is pretty much another
word for probation. And probation is a
court-ordered period of supervision
where an offender&#39;s freedom is
restricted with the community instead of
jail or prison. Also, you heard the term
pre-sentence report or you hear it in
some places called a PSI. It&#39;s pretty
much the background of the individual in
the situation. Typically, it&#39;s made by
the probation officer sent to the judge.
It&#39;ll speak about the offense, the
defendant&#39;s criminal and social history,
victim information, all this stuff that
the judge was pretty much just naming.
He&#39;s letting the people know that he&#39;s
doing it by the book. He&#39;s seen every
angle to this case and this is what&#39;s
coming his way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This first didn&#39;t want to mention the
things that were said to her. I read the
things that were said to her.
Can understand why she didn&#39;t want to
restate those cuz they were horrific.
What you said, what you did, what you
threatened to do.
uh to somebody who was walking down the
minding her own business is horrific.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You uh
to me
that it wasn&#39;t your intention
that you were going to Bedford or
something to shop with your cousin or
whatever it was. You didn&#39;t intend to
come to Lake County.
You didn&#39;t attend to a cost her on the
Uh but you did
I think during your statement blamed it
on Kate or whatever it was. Okay. That
that put you out of your right mind. But
but but you&#39;re responsible for what you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. If you put a substance into your
um that got you high or out of your mind
or whatever you want to call it that I
mean that&#39;s on you. Okay. You&#39;re
responsible for that. You&#39;re responsible
for the actions that follow that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sober or altered state of mind means
nothing, man. You decide to do it and
now you&#39;re going to pay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And to to a certain extent, you&#39;re
right. You don&#39;t have any sex offenses.
Okay. But you&#39;ve got a history of
violence. you got a history of theft
and uh about eight years ago or so, you
got a
an F3 grand theft in Kyogre County
that you were placed on diversion for
in uh November of 15. by February of 16
by the beginning so six weeks seven
weeks later you violate because you just
didn&#39;t report so you didn&#39;t perform
anything with regard to the diversion so
it was not it was unsuccessfully
terminated
and uh
uh two months after you were in that you
got at diversion. You got a uh theft
charge in Bedford,
a theft charge a couple months after
that with the RTA police,
a theft in August in Shaker Heights.
And then and then the big one, August
28th of 16, you get an aggravated
robbery with a firearm spec
and a CCW with a firearm spec.
So, in uh November of 16, you get
sentenced to 5 years on the egg robbery
with a one-year firearm spec
and a concurrent sentence on the F3
theft. So, you went to prison
December 6
of 2016,
released September 5th of 2021, put on 5
years of post-release control,
and reading from the the the
notes that were garnered from the Adult
Parole Authority
says that uh you were never in
compliance and had many issues on
parole, including having weapons, drugs,
and uh being a violator at large. So you
didn&#39;t report.
So after your release on September 5th
of 21, you had conditions that you had
to comply with that you complied with
none of them
and in fact affirmatively violated the
beyond your obligation on on postrelease
So you were given a sanction of of 9
months in prison for a violation. That
was April 26 of 22,
released on December 30th of 22. So that
was your sanction. You&#39;re back on
parole. December 30th, 22,
you were arrested on this one on January
9th of 23. So 11 days later, you get
arrested. 10 days later,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he&#39;s looking at the judge like, &#34;Man, I
forgot about all these.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; January 8th, there&#39;s a charge of uh
grand theft of a motor vehicle. which
there&#39;s an outstanding warrant issued
for that. So that&#39;s a day before this.
And then you come out here
on January 9th for whatever reason, lost
or not lost, you come out here,
Miss First is walking down the street
and uh and you attack her
and you grab her around the neck and you
choke her. You sexually assault her.
And then uh luckily for her,
she garnered up the strength to uh whack
you in the face with a fist and got
And then apparently
when the police happen upon you, you&#39;re
talking about being assaulted by her,
which is unbelievable to me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow. This dude&#39;s definitely bottom of
the barrel.
So there is no excuse for what you did.
You Mr. Okconor said when you were 13
your grandmother died. Okay. And Okay.
But that was 17 years ago.
if they&#39;re born with a grandmother,
their grandmother dies.
Everybody if they&#39;re born with parents,
their parents die. Okay. But that
doesn&#39;t excuse anything. That&#39;s not an
excuse. It&#39;s not an explanation. Okay?
You&#39;ve you&#39;ve led your life in such a
way that your concern has always been on
what you could get,
how you could get high,
how you could
apparently, and by your own admission,
you know, you&#39;re a you&#39;ve been a a
thief. You you take things from other
people. So your concern has been focused
on on you for your entire life. Now
there&#39;s people that have bad upbringings
that don&#39;t do that. So it&#39;s not an
excuse. It&#39;s not an excuse to blame your
environment. Okay? You&#39;re a product of
your environment. The question is
whether you&#39;re going to do anything to
change so that you&#39;re not a negative
product of your environment. So you can
be a positive product of your
environment. And you haven&#39;t done that.
Okay. So all this culminated in a woman
walking down the street getting choked
and sexually assaulted be because of
you. Okay? And there&#39;s no excuse and
there&#39;s got to be accountability for it.
So that&#39;s where we&#39;re at.
So if I didn&#39;t say it yet, I&#39;ve
considered all provisions in 29 2911 29
2912 and 292913.
On count one, the kidnapping, I&#39;m going
to sentence you to a definite term of 11
years to an indefinite term of 16 1/2
years in prison.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On the repeat violent offender
specification, I&#39;m going to sentence you
to 5 years.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that by law is consecutive to the 11
to 16 and a half.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On count two, gross sexual imposition,
18 months. That&#39;ll be concurrent. Count
four, receiving stolen property, 18
months concurrent. and count five,
assault, 180 days concurrent.
Now, the indefinite portion of the
sentence on count one
is in the control of the Department of
Corrections. You will go to prison. The
Department of Corrections has criteria
by which there&#39;s a presumption you
should be released after the 11-year,
the definite portion of that. But they
can, depending on their criteria and
your compliance with their criteria,
keep you. but no longer than 16 and a
half years. And as I said, there&#39;s a
presumption you should be released at
11. So, it&#39;s a total sentence of 16
of 16 years at a definite minimum up to
21 12 years on the indefinite side
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the costs are assessed.
The remaining charges are dismissed.
When you get out, you&#39;re going to be on
postrelease control for 5 years with
conditions. If you violate the
conditions, the parole authority could
return you to prison for up to 9 months
for each violation up to one half of my
sentence. If your violation is a new
felony, you could get an additional
consecutive prison sentence for that
violation. The maximum of which is a
greater of 12 months or the time you
have left under your postrelease
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I said 15. The judge clarified it.
It is a 16 minimal year sentence.
Chances are though, that kind of
paperwork going into the prison system,
he might not make it to see that 16. in
the right cell box. Shoot. He might not
even make it a couple weeks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is there anything further from the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You just gave me You just said how much?
What you just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is there anything further from the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nothing. Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is there anything further from the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What did you say?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He gave you more than a half.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mr. Okconor, anything further?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not for me, your honor. I do believe
that Mr. White had one clarification on
the amount of years he should serve. of
a a definite minimum of 20 of 16 years
and a def an indefinite maximum of 21
and a half years.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that&#39;s a wrap, ladies gentlemen. If
you&#39;re to ask me, that one was highly
satisfying, especially hearing him at
the end say about how much time did you
say I got, your honor. You heard him
correctly, bro. Don&#39;t act like you
didn&#39;t. And you knew damn well what you
were doing. Attacking that elderly woman
in the middle of broad day. Seems like
she gave him a good fight and messed up
his plans. Who knows what if he got her
and took her in that car and got away.
Shout out one more time to the muffler
boys. Man, y&#39;all saved her life. And the
Chipotle workers not helping. I&#39;m still
giving y&#39;all the benefit of the doubt,
man. Y&#39;all were just busy rolling them
burritos, right? Just maintaining that
bag. Got to make sure the bills are
paid. And when that&#39;s taking place,
you&#39;re not witnessing any crimes
happening around you, man. You&#39;re just
watching the burrito. And what about the
sandpost oak? Man, it&#39;s unreal seeing
that in there. Not to mention the Roblox
timber and the AI teflon armadillo
chairs. Every single time I do a
courtroom analysis, my joy meter rises.
Hopefully, it does the same thing for
y&#39;all, ladies and gentlemen. But I&#39;m out
of here. If you enjoyed and you&#39;re new
to the channel, of course, hit that
like, subscribe, notification bell
before you leave. And more importantly
than anything, y&#39;all be easy, be safe,
and stay free.
