All right, so we&#39;re about a day since we
got our first chance to really see Cloud
Code sub agents. So since the
announcement from yesterday, we&#39;ve been
starting to really dive into putting
together a practical application how to
use these starting with software
development life cycle type agents. But
the idea here was not to just to create
the software development agents with all
your usual suspects that we saw from the
original supercloud repositories, but
starting to drill this into what is the
amount of context that you need to be
successful. So even what I have right
now is going to be a little bit long.
When I was starting to build some of
these agents, I saw that there were
warning messages for anything more than
400 characters, but I thought it was
extremely important to make sure that it
had the right amount of context. So, as
we kind of go, we&#39;ll probably tweak
these even further, but this is a really
good starting point that you can take a
look at and use right away. So, it
really is as simple as going into this
agent directory here. And you&#39;ll see
that we have markdown files that are
purpose-built by the specialized
capability of the agents that you&#39;d like
to use. And we&#39;re going to start with
the product manager orchestrator. So,
essentially what this file is going to
be is it&#39;s going to go ahead and say
that you&#39;re a product manager who
orchestrates the team of specialized
agents. So this is incredibly important
because you&#39;re focusing more on how to
leverage the team strengths as opposed
to doing the work yourself. So this is
an orchestrator agent that&#39;s going to
look at it and it&#39;s going to base it off
of just like any other product manager,
user value over feature count, team
collaboration over heroic. So all the
things you would think of traditional
great leadership styles. And as we kind
of look through here, you&#39;re going to
see that there&#39;s some patterns that
we&#39;re using. So, who&#39;s responsible for
what type of capabilities? Whether
that&#39;s your PRD, your product or project
requirement document writer, your deep
research analyst for something that is
something that you need to learn about,
your system architect, and so on and so
forth. So, as you can see, there&#39;s a
there&#39;s a really solid breakdown of the
decision-making framework of who&#39;s going
to do what, the process of assigning it,
and as we go from those orchestrator
agents, now you can get into what the
system architect looks like, your senior
software engineer of what would be
there. And we&#39;ll go through and I have
noticed this with some of these YAML
formattings when we start to go through
them. So, what will I do after this?
will go through and I&#39;ll have my product
manager orchestrator. I&#39;ll give it from
the users perspective to be able to go
ahead here and make the necessary
updates that we need to do. So, here&#39;s
essentially what it&#39;s going to look
like. We&#39;re going to go over here and if
we clone into the repository for cloud
code sub agents, we can then copy the
agents, the markdown files. And in this
example, all I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m going here
and I&#39;m adding them directly into my
home directory. So those are my personal
agents that are global in nature and I
can use them on any project that I want
to do. So essentially all we have to do
here at this point in time we have it we
have an issue that we can go ahead here
and resolve. So what we&#39;ll do is let&#39;s
go ahead and fire up flawed and I&#39;m
going to use the dangerously skip
permissions option here so that way it
can run autonomously. If you do have
cloud code hooks, this is something that
you can take advantage of and you can
put single script implementations. So
that way you&#39;re not getting hit with it
accidentally removing files in your file
system. So once we have this fired up
here, if I go to agents, you&#39;re going to
see that I have all of these agents
available to me right now. So, I&#39;m going
to go ahead here and I&#39;m going to give
it a ro and I&#39;m going to call it user.
And I&#39;m going to say delegate to and I
don&#39;t know if this is the best way, but
this has been working for me lately.
Delegate to the product manager. And
we&#39;re going to go ahead and give it a
task. And this task I&#39;m going to
actually use voice here in just a
second. So, we&#39;re going to go ahead and
take a look. And on the senior software
engineer, we have the following error.
So, we will go ahead and revert back.
in the agents directory for the senior
software engineer sub agent. We&#39;re
getting the following YAML error.
And all I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to
drop that in.
Please use the sequential thinking MCP
server and Serena MCP server to be able
to complete the necessary activities.
Please ensure that you&#39;re delegating to
the appropriate team members so we can
get this issue resolved.
And all we&#39;re doing here is I&#39;m using
Whisper Flow to be able to be a little
bit even more efficient. So what&#39;s going
to happen is behind the scenes here,
it&#39;s going to start computing. It&#39;s
going to go through it and then as it
gets to the different stages, it&#39;s going
to go ahead here and delegate out to the
appropriate members on the team. So you
can see right off the bat we&#39;re getting
the product manager orchestrator agent
sub agent and it&#39;s going to go through
and do its work through sequential
thinking as you can see here where it&#39;s
calling out to the MCP server and it&#39;s
now go ahead and registering over to
Serena to do some of the work there. So
this is just a quick little rundown of
what this will look like. We&#39;ll push
this update out after it gets completed,
but wanted to give a rundown of here&#39;s
how you can start to use this. Now the
PRD file that we do have on this. If we
go back over to
you can see that we have a technical
implementation template. So just because
we were doing software development life
cycle doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t use any
other use case. So I&#39;m going to start
playing with this for the next video and
start doing some non-technical sub aents
that we can use for any of our general
workflows. So I hope this helps. If it
was helpful, please subscribe and we&#39;ll
see you on the next one.
