Mom, we&#39;re just going to dive in. We&#39;re
just going to dive in.
We&#39;re talking about unpopular opinions.
Unpopular opinions. And you know, you
know what they say about opinions?
Everyone has one. Like a booty hole.
some are bigger than others.
We&#39;re going to talk about
[Laughter]
Indeed. So, we&#39;re going to talk about
like food. We&#39;ll talk about some some uh
people in the music game. We&#39;ll talk
about the controversy, the uncomfortable
workplace norms and all of that. So, you
want you want me to start? I&#39;ll start a
little bit. I actually have I have some
good food and drink ones. You want to
start? You want me to start?
Sure. Let&#39;s hit it.
So, it says pineapple absolutely belongs
on pizza. Do you agree or disagree?
I have to disagree on that one.
Absolutely not. I&#39;ve never t tasted it,
but it just does not go together in my
Yeah, same. I&#39;m good on that. What about
cilantro? It says it it tastes great and
it&#39;s cilantro is like some people say it
tastes like soap and I&#39;m like, how do
you know what soap tastes like? What do
you How do you feel about cilantro?
I love cilantro.
I love it. Especially like in a salad.
Yeah, cilantro is good. It&#39;s good to me.
Yeah, I like that herb.
What about you?
Cilantro. Cilantro is a staple in my
house because I feel like I put it in
all types of stews. Like I I do this
dish. Um this it&#39;s called it&#39;s it&#39;s
really it&#39;s gest. It&#39;s like a Spanish
dish and you it&#39;s stewed pork chops but
I make it in a way where it&#39;s just it&#39;s
just immaculate and I have to have
cilantro in every stew dish that I make.
every stew dish. Like it&#39;s just I
channel those
those Hispanic those Latin flavors and
cilantro definitely
is a staple in my house. I I feel like
when I go to the supermarkets definitely
on my list of herbs to get. So yeah,
cilantro for the win.
Well, this this stew that you&#39;re talking
about, what about oregano?
So you
it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s the accent for me.
Yeah. Oregano.
They use that a lot in the Yeah. In the
Hispanic culture, I feel like. Yeah.
Okay. Go ahead. I&#39;m sorry.
Yeah, definitely. Oregano as well. And
you already know how I feel about oil of
oregano, but we won&#39;t. Oh, yeah. Another
day, another time.
Oh, yeah. I have mine right here. I
actually need to take one.
You want to take it? Come on, take your
vitamins. That&#39;s what I tell my ladies
every night. Take your vitamins. Say
your prayers.
I definitely will. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I
don&#39;t have water, otherwise I would. But
this is what it looks like. It&#39;s a
little capsule,
but I&#39;ll take it in a moment. Moment or
two, but go ahead. I digress. I&#39;m sorry.
No, I mean, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll definitely hold.
Got to get water. I don&#39;t have water.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Pumpkin spice. Mom, you&#39;re a pumpkin
spice type of girl.
So, I do like pumpkin muffins from uh
Infamous Wawa that we have down here.
They have a really good pumpkin muffin,
but I don&#39;t do like a pumpkin spice
latte and I don&#39;t do it in like coffee,
but I will have a muffin, but I don&#39;t
want pumpkin pie either. So,
I don&#39;t know.
Okay. Well, uh, listen, don&#39;t take away
her black card cuz you know, black
people, we don&#39;t do pumpkin. We do sweet
Yeah, but you can always find sweet
potato muffins. I love muffins. Yeah.
No, I I definitely love sweet potatoes,
but I will do a pumpkin muffin. I will
but don&#39;t take don&#39;t take my card,
please. Yeah.
How do you like your steak, Mom? How do
you like your steak? It says steak is
better well done than rare. Rare is a
diabolical. Rare.
Yeah, rare is still mooing. I can&#39;t deal
with that. But I&#39;ll do medium well.
Yeah, medium well. Sure. Not rare.
Never. And well done is too much. that&#39;s
too tough. I still like, you know, my
steaks to be a little tender. So, I
think medium well is is fine.
Or medium rare.
That&#39;s usually my go-to.
Medium well. Yeah. Some people are
starting to do medium rare because it&#39;s
very tender and just like a little bit
of pink, but I don&#39;t even like that.
Give me medium. Well,
I definitely agree with you, Mom. I
can&#39;t I don&#39;t want to see the pink.
very very faint, but
You know, now ketchup on everything is
totally acceptable, including eggs.
Nah. Nah.
Not for me.
Who are these people?
And I&#39;ve never tried it. I&#39;ve never
tried ketchup on eggs, but I&#39;ve been
around a lot of folks who do that. They
love it. They say it&#39;s really, really
good. But
just give me some cheese, salt, and
pepper, and I&#39;m good on my eggs.
I I agree. How do you feel about
avocados? You make a mean mean
guacamole. So, I already know you love
But they&#39;re saying that it&#39;s they&#39;re
they&#39;re bland. Avocados are bland and
only taste good with salt or lemon,
which is obviously one of the
ingredients for guacamole. Well, two of
the ingredients for guacamole.
Yeah. No, I agree. I don&#39;t just eat
plain avocado. Like, I&#39;ll put it on a
sandwich maybe, but then I I you have to
add a little salt and pepper or
something on there. It is bland just by
itself. I agree with that.
Yeah. Dad is not gonna like this one
because he loves what I&#39;m about to
mention next. Someone said Oreos taste
like cardboard unless dipped in milk.
That is funny. Funny.
Yeah. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t do the chocolate
Oreos. I do the lemon ones, but the thin
ones, they&#39;re very, very thin and just
have a little smear of like lemon
filling. Those are good. Those are
really good. But the chocolate Oreos
with the vanilla, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t do
I&#39;m disgusted, actually, because I feel
like we are the same person. Those are
the Oreos I get, too.
Do you?
I&#39;m like, we are literally the same
Oh, that is hilarious. And I just
started eating them like a few months
back. Like uh Nora turned me on to them.
That&#39;s one of the things we&#39;ll have like
on our Friday night when we&#39;re playing
cards as a little snack. But typically I
don&#39;t I don&#39;t really eat cookies like
Yeah. Same. But they&#39;re good like with a
glass of wine. Like just a couple. Just
a handful. I don&#39;t go crazy.
Yeah. You don&#39;t need many.
So wait, companion. So wait, hold on. I
know you didn&#39;t hear my dad, but my dad
is like the producer when I said that. I
could hear him say, &#34;Ew, I think he&#39;s
going to disagree after this.&#34;
Yeah, cuz all he does is drink milk with
his He loves Oreos with milk, but he
hasn&#39;t been eating them that much lately
just because we&#39;re not supposed to, you
know, try to be good.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. So, here&#39;s a sweet
tooth con some sweet tooth
controversies. I&#39;ll go through them. The
first one is cake is usually dry. Pie is
better. I know you love a good pie,
especially peach cobbler.
Frosting ruins more cakes than it saves.
Dark chocolate is superior to milk
chocolate. Fruit and dessert is rarely a
good idea. Looking at you, raisins. Ew,
raisins. Ew. Ice cream is better soft
and melty, not rock hard.
soft and frosting. I definitely I want
frosting on my cake for sure.
And when I eat ice cream, I want to eat
ice cream. I don&#39;t want to drink thick
milk. Like I like my ice cream nice and
firm. Yeah. So
And I love fruit.
I agree.
You like fruit and dessert in particular
like the Cuz you like peach cobbler. You
like apple pie. So we we does this. Who
are these people? Like I keep Who are
these people?
I know who Yeah. Yeah, I do love peach
cobbla. Apple pie. I don&#39;t really like
cooked apples. So, like when my mom
makes an apple pie, I&#39;ll scrape the
apples out. You pick them out
and I&#39;ll I pick them out, heat up the
crust so it&#39;s nice and warm, and then
put ice cream on top of that. So, I&#39;m
just eating really the crust and the ice
cream. I&#39;m not big on cooked apples, but
I do like the peaches and peach cobbler.
So, I know I&#39;m strange. I know.
Once again, I&#39;m disgusted cuz grandma
always yells at me for wasting the
apples. I do the same thing.
You like I don&#39;t understand. Yes.
That is hilarious. Hilarious. Do you
like the peaches though and the peach
I don&#39;t I&#39;m I&#39;m not a peach fan. The
only peach I like is my aunt.
Peach cobbler.
That makes one of us. No, I&#39;m kidding. I
love her.
Stop it.
That&#39;s her sister, by the way.
Companion. You know, you know how
I love her.
Until she doesn&#39;t. No, I&#39;m kidding. I&#39;m
kidding. I&#39;m kidding. Okay, let&#39;s dive
in, companions. That&#39;s enough about
food. I&#39;m not messy. I&#39;m not messy. I
kid. I kid. Let&#39;s dive in to the my
mom&#39;s favorite topic, music. She loves
music. Now, you&#39;re going to agree with
this this this first one.
this first one says, &#34;Tupac was more of
a poet and icon than a great rapper.&#34;
Agreed. I was not a Tupac fan. I&#39;m
probably an anomaly, too. Not that I
didn&#39;t like him. Like, I loved him as a
person, but like his music just didn&#39;t
do it for me. Biggie all day. Sorry.
With love.
And I&#39;m I&#39;m more of a Tupac fan. Yeah.
With love. It says Biggie. And it&#39;s
crazy because the next one is about
Biggie. It says Biggie had better flow,
but his catalog is overrated because
it&#39;s short.
Well, we know why it&#39;s short. Yeah. you
know, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s overrated.
I think for what he has put out, Biggie
was it. He was it. He had them clubs
jumping, jumping.
And I often think, you know, what would
he sound like today just with how rap
music has changed, you know? I would be
interested to hear
what he would sound like today.
I think he would be retired with Jay-Z
on an island somewhere.
You think so? Yeah.
The next one is Eminem. It says Eminem&#39;s
technical skills are impressive, but his
music isn&#39;t replayable.
I was a Eminem fan. I have him on a
couple of my playlists. I don&#39;t have him
on my playlist that I play all the time,
but he&#39;s he&#39;s on a couple of ones that I
play from time to time.
Yeah, I like I liked Eminem. I think he
this one is about uh Mr. West, Kanye
West. Someone said West was never the
best rapper, just the best producer.
Can&#39;t tell Kanye that.
I know. I know.
I dare you to say that to his face.
And he I mean very talented. I But I
will say I don&#39;t think I have him on any
of my playlists. I don&#39;t have any of his
music. Like if I hear it on the radio,
I&#39;ll bop. I know. Dad loved that. Loved
it. I know. I just I don&#39;t have it. I
don&#39;t dislike it, but I was never like,
&#34;Oh, gotta put that on my my playlist.&#34;
Nah, I&#39;m good.
Dang. All right. Kendrick Lamar. They
said Kendrick Lamar&#39;s albums are dense,
but not always enjoyable. I know you&#39;re
not a Kendrick fan, Mom.
I know. I feel shots being fired. I got
to duck. I got to duck. I&#39;m like
probably the only one. Yeah. Like again,
like him as a person, but his music
doesn&#39;t do it for me. And that whole
hype about the Drake disc, like I don&#39;t
know, maybe I&#39;m old. The beat was fire.
The beat was fire, but the lyrics I just
was like, &#34;All right.&#34;
But no, not a Kendrick Lamar fan at all.
Love what he does for the community and
that sort of thing, but as an artist,
no. And he&#39;s great. I mean, he&#39;s he he&#39;s
great, but it&#39;s just just not my cup of
I&#39;m sorry.
You&#39;re entitled to that, baby. J. Cole
is mid. Someone said he&#39;s deep without
saying much.
I love J. Cole. I really do. I think he
is. I love the fact that he&#39;s humble. I
love the fact that,
you know, he&#39;s not out here with all the
the gold chains and the, you know,
living this talking about this lifestyle
that he&#39;s not really living. Like, I
love him and I think he&#39;s clever. His
lyrics are are pretty clever. I do have
him on my playlist. I love JCole.
So, I met him. Well, I saw him. I
actually did a photo shoot for my job. I
was in a photo shoot for my job and we
did I did like we were shooting right in
front of the building where he lives and
he came out of the building and I was
trying to figure out I&#39;m in the middle
Yeah. I&#39;m in the I&#39;m in the middle of
trying to, you know, pose for Vogue, you
know, and here J.Cole goes stealing my
spotlight.
Oh my god.
And the crowd goes, &#34;Wow.&#34; Oh, like it
was just so many people. Yeah, it was so
many people like, &#34;Oh my god, is that
JCole?&#34; And then him and I literally
caught each other&#39;s eye. He was like,
&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me, girl. Do your
thing.&#34; And he went on on his bike. He
was riding a bike. He got on his bike
and just,
you know, went on about his business.
But JCole spoke to me,
Okay. All right, JC.
He said, &#34;Do your thing, girl.&#34; Cole.
Can I see you, Kimmy Chris? I see you
over there.
he&#39;s cute. And uh I love that
he&#39;s cute. He&#39;s cute in real life.
Yeah, he&#39;s a good-look guy.
He is. This one says, &#34;Drake is a pop
star who raps when it&#39;s convenient.&#34;
Not coming for Drizzy. I like Drake. I
like his music. I like Drake. I don&#39;t
get involved with, you know, the beefs
and the all of this. Yeah. What?
So, I told your brother, my uncle, that
I like Drake. You know what he said to
me? He said, &#34;You don&#39;t like Drake. You
like the person who writes Drake&#39;s
lyrics cuz Drake doesn&#39;t write his own
lyrics. So, you don&#39;t really like him.&#34;
I&#39;m like, &#34;You know, you know your
brother.&#34; So,
yeah. I&#39;m like, you know what? That&#39;s
what artist really does.
People, right? And people have been
saying that for years, not just about
him, just you know, rappers in general.
Cardi B has a ghostriter. This person
has a ghostriter. I Whatever. They
deliver it fire. So I That part doesn&#39;t
bother me. It doesn&#39;t bother me.
Yeah. Same. This is going to cause some
controversy. Jay-Z&#39;s legacy is more
business than bars.
You know what? Um, I like Jay-Z. I like
some of his earlier music. Um, but he
was never one that I was like, &#34;Oh my
god, I&#39;m I&#39;m a huge fan.&#34; No, I like his
music, but
if I never hear another song from him,
I&#39;ll I&#39;ll live. I&#39;ll be all right.
Same. And I think he knows that. That&#39;s
why he retired.
Mhm. Mhm. Yeah.
I I do, too.
Oh, this is my girl. Y&#39;all know I love
me. Listen, I know some people this was
a whole big thing in my lady group
because my ladies know I love Cardi and
my ladies know I love Nicki Minaj and
they were like, &#34;You can&#39;t love both.
You got to choose.&#34; I will not choose.
That&#39;s like choosing God and Jesus. I
want them both. Okay.
Oh, they&#39;re making you choose. I choose.
Someone said Nicki. I know who you would
choose. You would choose Cardi. I know
I love her. I love that girl.
Me, too. Me, too. Someone said, &#34;Nicki
Minaj is lyrically stronger than most of
her male peers.&#34; And I think Nick Nicki
Minaj is phenomenal. I I I do. I love
her. Her cookiness. She&#39;s She&#39;s a little
cookie, but I love it.
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Cardi B is my girl.
You&#39;re not going to like the next one. I
know. I know you love Cardi B. Same. But
you&#39;re not going to like this next one.
This is about your boy. Your boy Little
What did they say? Feel like a gremlin.
What did they say? shortlived.
Yeah. Yeah. You go off. Someone said
Little Wayne&#39;s peak was short-lived and
massively overhyped.
I don&#39;t agree with that. Little Wayne is
so clever.
I come out the scuffle without a
scuffle. Like I love him. He is so
clever. His lyrics like people have to
live. And whether he&#39;s writing them or
not, I don&#39;t know. But I love his music.
I&#39;m so sorry. Love his music.
Yeah, he&#39;s a goat.
What&#39;s a goon to a goblin? Yes. He said
little Wayne said, &#34;I got 10 bathrooms.
I could all day.&#34;
Yeah. I love him. I love him. He&#39;s
underrated. He really is. They better
stop sleeping on him.
Yeah, I agree. I love Little Wayne, too.
Okay. So, now we have some uncomfortable
workplace norms. So, tell me how you
feel about this. Management often
promotes people who won&#39;t challenge
them. Have you had that experience?
Yes. But I also say, you know, my whole
thing with like my work ethic, I just
feel like it&#39;s impeccable.
And one thing about me is I don&#39;t care
whether or not I&#39;m liked. I want to be
respected,
you know? And I think that&#39;s that&#39;s what
makes me stand out,
you know. And I agree with you&#39;re not
going to be promoted if you know, you
don&#39;t ask questions that people usually
want to ask but are intimidated, you
know, with doing so. So, I agree with
this. I feel like I can be uh a little
challenging. I can be. Yeah. Because if
I don&#39;t agree with something, if you&#39;re
appointing me a task and you&#39;re telling
me to do it this way and I don&#39;t agree
with your way, I feel like my way is
more beneficial. It&#39;s more efficient,
then I&#39;m going to present that to you.
Some people just don&#39;t like that. They
want you to do it their way. And I&#39;m
like, your way may not make sense to me.
As long as we&#39;re getting the same
result, as long as it&#39;s done correctly,
it could be multiple ways of doing
things. as long as it&#39;s done
the right way, you know. So,
I agree.
As long as you follow the proper
All right. What about u good employees
burn out because they get punished with
more work.
Whole fact.
Snapple fact
for sure.
Current life.
I&#39;ll say it, too.
Yeah. And I I won&#39;t say punished. It&#39;s
like a gift and a curse. Like, you know,
you do your job, you do it, you know it,
you do it well, and then they&#39;re like,
well, you know, Kimmy is great at that.
You know, let&#39;s give it to her. And
sometimes they don&#39;t check to see if you
even have the bandwidth to take on
additional tasks. But it happens all the
time. All the time. All right. Here&#39;s
another one. People don&#39;t leave bad
jobs. They leave bad managers and then
lie about it. For sure.
Everyday life, baby. Absolutely.
I just think at this point we have
managers, but we do not have leaders. If
you are my manager, I expect you to lead
me. I expect you to teach me. I want to
feel like I&#39;m leaving my 9 to5 and I&#39;m
coming home with, damn, I actually
learned something. But yet all day all
I&#39;ve been doing is teaching
my manager, leading my manager. So it&#39;s
not what you know these days. It&#39;s who
you know that gets you in these
positions that people are in.
Yeah, for sure.
And we have to remember too that you
know just because you have that title of
manager doesn&#39;t make you a leader. Like
leaders lead people and managers manage
things. So that&#39;s important to note as
well. So all right, here&#39;s the last one.
Open communication is encouraged until
you say something real. Clock it. Okay.
I feel like this person is attacking my
life. This person&#39;s attacking me.
Do I have a stalker that&#39;s just I feel
like my life is under a microscope right
now. Someone&#39;s watching me. You are you
out there? If you know, you know. Hey
are you watching me? If you know, you
know, you won&#39;t know, Mom.
So, you know what that means? You have
to You have to maybe make a change.
Maybe it&#39;s a change.
You don&#39;t watch you.
Maybe it&#39;s No.
Yeah, I know. Yeah.
Maybe it&#39;s time to relocate. Anyway,
moving on. So, here&#39;s the last one. This
is genuine opinions about kids.
Yeah. Just throw that in there.
Everyone finds kids. Not everyone finds
kids cute, and that&#39;s okay. Do you think
that&#39;s okay? I think all kids are
adorable. Now, their behavior, that&#39;s a
whole another situation.
You don&#39;t
It&#39;s a whole another topic.
Some kids are just annoying. Not
misunderstood.
Not gifted,
just annoying.
You know anyone like that?
Y&#39;all better leave those booas alone.
No. I mean, yeah, kids. I mean, humans I
mean, humans in general are annoying.
Leave those kids alone. They&#39;re innocent
souls. It&#39;s the adults that are annoying
to me. I always say kids are innocent
until proven guilty. Adults are guilty
until proven innocent. That&#39;s how I
That&#39;s how I feel about New Yorkers.
Everybody guilty until you prove me
otherwise. But okay. Um, you don&#39;t have
to love kids to be a good person. You
agree with that?
You don&#39;t have to love kids to be a good
What the hell does that mean, Mom? I&#39;m
confused. You don&#39;t have to love kids to
be a good person.
Cuz some people don&#39;t like kids. Like
they don&#39;t. Some people don&#39;t like them.
They don&#39;t want to have them. But that
doesn&#39;t make them a bad person, right?
Yes, it does make them a bad person. How
can you not like kids?
Have you seen these Jenzers out here
Listen, I get it. Not wanting kids is
one thing, but not liking them is a
whole another. Like, no. You You are
I&#39;ve come across some kids I didn&#39;t
like. I really have. I really have.
Yeah, I have. Maybe I am a bad person. I
don&#39;t know. But here&#39;s the last one. Is
it okay to prefer pets?
No, you&#39;re not a bad person.
Thank you.
Those fourlegged little things. And I&#39;m
speaking of dogs. I&#39;m talking about dogs
in this particular
hope so
situation.
I mean, pets are pets. Yeah. Okay. I get
it. But I&#39;m just speaking in general. I
know a lot of people who would prefer
who will choose their their dogs over
their kids, you know.
So, listen, they say dogs are are men
are men&#39;s special.
I know that you tend to watch shows over
and over, so you probably are not even
caught up on the shy, but I got to tell
you, the shy
episode 12
hated the episode. hated it. I couldn&#39;t
stand it. And let me tell you why. Ain&#39;t
no way
gangsters or people who have been in
prison before are going to move a body,
a dead body from the floor to the couch.
Like, who does that? They wouldn&#39;t dare
touch that body. Then you have Kesha and
Tiff giving birth on the same day. Come
on, son. Come on. Like, and then of
course, Tiff ends up having her baby in
the elevator. What a novel idea. We&#39;ve
never seen that before, right? Never.
Like, I felt like I was watching like a
soap opera, All My Children, on One Life
to Live back in the day. But I will say
this, the only tasteful thing that I
loved about the episode was that Jada,
Emit&#39;s mom, she was able to see her
grandbaby before she transitions. And
then the fact that they named the baby
after her was beautiful. Like that part
had me crying. Like I was literally
crying. But I could go on and on and on
about this episode. This this is
literally the first time in the history
of this show that I went to bed angry.
Like I was livid. And if it were my
show, none of those writers would have
got paid for that episode. There&#39;s no
way. But then they they would probably
sue me, right? And that would be a whole
other drama that I&#39;d have to go through.
So maybe I would pay them for the
episode, but that would be their last
paycheck from me. You heard the last
one. Horrible, horrible ending. Did you
see it?
I did not see it, Mom. But you cannot
blame the writers because it has to be
before it&#39;s produced. So someone
approved, someone from from top,
you know, with the authority proved
this. So they need to
Everybody&#39;s going Everybody&#39;s getting a
pink slip from the writers. Yeah,
somebody had to approve it, but who on
that writing team thought that this was
going to be a great episode? Like why
would you even submit that for approval?
So everybody everybody looking for a new
job. There&#39;s no way. No way. You have to
see it. If you don&#39;t finish anything
else, just look at the last episode.
Crazy with love.
I don&#39;t have to look at it, Mom. You
already told me.
I spoiled it for you.
Sorry. You got to keep up with what&#39;s
going on and stop watching the same
shows over and over.
It makes me happy.
Companions, this is our time where we
need to part ways. We appreciate your
love. We appreciate your ongoing
support. We love you for loving us the
way that you do. We ask that you kindly
