Ladies and gentlemen, the motion today
that I&#39;m opposing, and I hope you all
are, too, is Trump 2.0 will make the
world a safer place,
I&#39;ll be honest, it&#39;s a ridiculous
motion. To believe this motion, you have
to have been asleep for Trump 1.0. You
have to have been in a literal coma
between 2017 and 2021 when Donald Trump
did more drone strikes than Barack
Obama, tore up the Iran nuclear deal,
withdrew from the INF arms control
treaty, helped Saudi Arabia bomb and
besiege Yemen, bombed Syria, dropped the
mother of all bombs on Afghanistan, and
then did a friendly deal with the
Taliban, heaped phrase on Vladimir
Putin, threatened North Korea with
nuclear war, and then exchanged love
letters with Kim Jong-un. The world was
not a safer place under Trump 1.0. And
to believe that Trump 2.0 toe will make
the world a safer place. You also have
to have been asleep since January 20th
of this year. You have to have buried
your head in the sand. Safer.
Safer. Safer for whom? Not for the
people of Iran. More than a thousand of
whom were killed in Israeli air strikes
proved and blessed by Donald Trump as
excellent. And it wasn&#39;t just the
Israelis. Donald Trump, the guy who said
he would be the anti-war president, the
guy who said he would end the endless
wars in the Middle East, bombed Iran
himself last month in violation of both
the UN charter and the US Constitution.
He blew up diplomatic negotiations. He
failed to actually destroy all of the
highlyenriched uranium which has now
disappeared and is unaccounted for. And
so, as the former conservative foreign
secretary, former leader of Michael&#39;s
own party, William Hey, said the other
week, Trump&#39;s bombing of Iran makes it
quote, &#34;More likely than it was before
these events, that we will wake up one
morning, 10 or 20 years from now, to
discover that Iran has a nuclear bomb.&#34;
Well done, Mr. President. Trump will
make the world safer. Safer for whom?
Not for the people of Gaza, who continue
to be massacred on a daily basis in
their hundreds and thousands. Just six
kids killed yesterday lining up for
water since Netanyahu violated Trump&#39;s
ceasefire back in March with Trump&#39;s
blessing. Over 6,000 Palestinians have
been killed and 21,000 injured.
Meanwhile, Trump has given the green
light to the most far-right people in
Israel to both starve the people of Gaza
and ethnically cleanse the place. He
just signed off on a half a billion
dollar arms deal with Israel, a
government, a country that is led by a
man who is wanted by the International
Criminal Court. Trump will make the
world safer. safer for whom? Not for the
people of Yemen, who Trump bombed in
March, April, and May of this year,
killing over 200 civilians. More than
were killed in all American attacks on
Yemen over the past 20 years, including
80 civilians in an oil refinery and 60
migrants trapped in a detention center.
All dead, thanks to Donald Trump. But
he&#39;ll make the world safer. Safer for
whom? Not for the people of Ukraine, who
Trump effectively abandoned since he
berated their president in the Oval
Office on live television, then kicked
him out of the White House, then brought
in a pause on intelligence sharing with
Ukraine, which led to the deaths of
hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, dozens
of Ukrainian civilians. Michael used to
be a big supporter of Ukraine, but now
he&#39;s here tonight defending Trump. The
same Trump who just last month halted
crucial arms shipments and munitions
destined for Ukraine, desperately needed
by Ukraine. Now he&#39;s saying, &#34;Oh, well,
he&#39;s going to change his mind. he&#39;s
actually going to send the weapons, but
he&#39;s all over the place. He&#39;s Trump.
So, I don&#39;t know. I guess the Ukrainian
people are on their own in this new
safer world brought about by Trump 2.0.
The truth is that Trump is all too happy
to deliver the keys to Keev and the
property deeds to Gaza, to Vladimir
Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu. He&#39;s all
too happy for foreign autocrats to take
what they want by force. He is. I mean,
you don&#39;t think Xiinping, who Trump
calls a friend and says he has great
chemistry with, you don&#39;t think Xiinping
is watching what&#39;s happening in Ukraine
and thinking Taiwan is just there for
the taking. By the way, Trump, ever the
mob boss, says Taiwan should pay the US
protection money for its defense. So,
look, Trump 2.0&#39;s foreign policy is a
recipe, I&#39;m sorry to say, for more war,
not more peace. This is a US president
who has increased the military budget to
a record high. Who loves to cozy up to
aggressive foreign dictators while
threatening his own democratic allies,
not just Ukraine. He says he wants to
annex Canada. He wants to invade Panama.
He wants to conquer Greenland. Is this
what a safer world looks like? The
United States going to war with Denmark?
And let&#39;s be clear, this is serious
stuff. This isn&#39;t a joke. There are real
world consequences to Trump&#39;s bumbling
belligerance, to his reckless rhetoric,
to his unbelievable unstableness. You
have Poland, Poland now considering
getting nuclear weapons. You have South
Korea considering getting nukes. You
have Germany, God help us, thinking
about nukes. All because Donald Trump
has abandoned US allies, threatened US
allies, and made the world a less safe
place, more unstable, more chaotic, more
dangerous. And this isn&#39;t just about war
and peace. Trump is making the world a
less safe place in myriad ways. He&#39;s
undermined the global fight against
climate change, which Michael has said
in the past Western countries have a
moral responsibility to tackle. He
appointed a antivaxer, Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., to run his health department, who
promptly announced a cut in US funding
to the world&#39;s most important global
vaccine alliance. Michael in government
during the pandemic was an evangelist
for vaccines. Trump let Elon Musk gut
the US aid department and completely
undermine the global fight against HIV,
AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, things that
Michael fought against in government.
The Lancet Medical Journal said last
month that thanks to Trump&#39;s cuts to the
US aid budget, we could see 14 million
additional deaths over the next 5 years,
including the deaths of over 4 and a
half million children under the age of
five. Is that your idea of safety? Is
that anyone&#39;s idea of a safer world?
More disease, more bombing, more global
warming, more authoritarians and ethnic
cleansers around the world, emboldened
by the president of the United States,
more chaos, more havoc, more turmoil.
How could anyone seriously say Trump is
making the world a safer place? Safer
for whom? Safer for big oil and the arms
industry? Sure. Safer for dictators and
authoritarians? Absolutely. Safer for
billionaires who want to dodge taxes? No
doubt about it. But safer for ordinary
civilians? No, not for ordinary
civilians in places like Gaza City or
Taipei or Kev. Not for journalists or
dissidents or whistleblowers living
under the rule of Trump&#39;s authoritarian
pals in Pyongyang or Beijing or Moscow.
Not for the climate which continues to
threaten our very existence on this
planet. This motion feels like a parody.
I mean, saying Donald Trump has made the
world a safe place is like saying George
Bush brought peace to Iraq or Boris
Johnson brought dignity to Downing
Street. It&#39;s like saying, I don&#39;t know,
Michael Gove got Brexit right. It&#39;s
demonstrable right? So, ladies
and gentlemen,
when you look at the ranting, raving,
bullying, berating, ignorant, insane
Trump, you don&#39;t think of safety. You
don&#39;t think that&#39;s the guy protecting
the world. And to be honest, whatever
Michael tells you tonight, he doesn&#39;t
believe that either. Just last October,
he said if he was an American, he would
vote for Kla Harris, not Donald Trump.
And yet here he is tonight making the
case for Trump, defending the
indefensible, trying to make you all
believe that the arsonist is really the
firefighter. That the guy pouring
gasoline, petrol on the flames of
conflict in the Middle East and beyond,
he&#39;s really pouring water. Come on. Are
you kidding me? The world is not a safer
place. You know it. I know it. Michael
Gove knows it. Donald Trump knows it.
And so I urge you all to reject this
absurd, offensive, and laughable motion
tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to
oppose. Thank you very much.
