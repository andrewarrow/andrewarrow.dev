      <h1>Phones in Schools: Why Blanket Bans Miss the Point</h1>
      <p class="deck">A smart, funny look at why confiscation is the wrong fix, and what actually helps kids learn healthy tech habits.</p>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>Every generation has its “thing” that adults swear is destroying kids. For my mom it was MTV. For me it was video games (Mortal Kombat was apparently going to turn me into a bloodthirsty ninja). For today’s teenagers, the villain is the smartphone.</p>

      <p>And sure, I get it. Phones are distracting. They buzz, ding, and light up like little Vegas slot machines at exactly the wrong moment. Teachers don’t want a classroom full of kids silently scrolling TikTok instead of learning about mitochondria. Parents picture their child staring slack-jawed at an iPhone until their brain dissolves into a puddle of emojis. So the instinct is simple: take the phones away. Problem solved.</p>

      <p>Except it isn’t.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>School Is Not a Police State</h2>

      <p>The first problem with phone bans is enforcement. Teachers already juggle lesson plans, grading, teenagers with unlimited energy, and a caffeine habit that is one crisis away from collapse. Now we want them to moonlight as phone cops? Unsurprisingly, many don’t want to. And when they won’t, the responsibility lands on campus resource officers. Translation: police.</p>

      <p>We’ve already seen what happens. In the 1990s schools panicked over beepers. Yes, beepers. The logic was that pagers were linked to drug dealing. The result was predictable. Kids were harassed, arrested, and left with criminal records over a buzzing gadget the size of a matchbox. If we replay that script with phones, we are just guaranteeing more unnecessary confrontations between students and police. Algebra class should not end with handcuffs.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The New Moral Panic</h2>

      <p>Every era has its moral panic, and once it’s over it looks ridiculous. Comic books were supposed to rot our brains. Rock music was supposed to deliver us straight to hell. Video games were supposed to turn us violent. Now the panic is about phones and teen depression.</p>

      <p>But the evidence does not line up neatly with that fear. Researchers who have actually spent their careers on this, people like Candace Rogers and Alice Marwick, keep finding the same thing. Phones are not the root cause. Poverty is. Stressful home environments are. Growing up in a world that feels unstable and overwhelming is. Phones can magnify existing struggles, but they don’t create depression out of thin air. They are more like a thermometer that shows something is wrong, not the disease itself.</p>

      <p>If we mistake the symptom for the cause, we never solve the real problems.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Inequity in Disguise</h2>

      <p>There is also the practical problem that rarely makes headlines. Not every kid walks into school with a shiny laptop. For a lot of students, the phone in their pocket is the only computer they own. It is their word processor, their calculator, their research tool. About fifteen percent of students are disabled, and many rely on phones for accessibility.</p>

      <p>When schools ban phones outright, it is not the wealthiest kids who suffer. It is the ones already dealing with less. Unless lawmakers are willing to pass bans that come with massive funding for alternative devices and tech support, the result is just deeper inequity.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Learning Self-Control</h2>

      <p>Phones are not going anywhere. They are part of college, part of jobs, part of life. Pretending we can bubble-wrap kids until age eighteen and then unleash them into the adult world with zero practice is absurd. It is like refusing to teach children how to cross a street because cars are dangerous, then acting surprised when they step off the curb and get flattened.</p>

      <p>What kids need is practice. They need to learn how to use technology with boundaries, how to put the screen down when it is not appropriate, how to separate tool from toy. If we want adults who can regulate themselves, we have to start while they are still students.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>What “Screen Time” Really Means</h2>

      <p>The phrase “screen time” is tossed around like it is a diagnosis, but it is a useless measurement without context. Two hours spent scrolling endless videos that make you feel bad is not the same as two hours spent messaging friends, writing a story, or editing a short film.</p>

Joining us now is Taylor Loren, who as
often is at the center of some internet
discourse, this time around uh the moves
by uh schools that are opening up this
week and next to uh ban phones inside
their walls. Um I told uh my 14-year-old
that we were going to be talking about
this and she is utterly uh shocked and
appalled um that I think that they
should actually have to put their phones
away when they go into the school.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; She&#39;s team that I disagree with you on
this. Um, she
she just apopleleetic. Um, 100%
supportive of of your position. Um,
the from talking to other friends of
hers as well as like I was reading the
um the Jackson Reed like student
newspaper about it last year when they
introduced the ban. I think if you
pulled the students in high school, it
would be roughly 99% if not 100% opposed
to these bands. So like they have a view
on this that I think does need to be uh
considered is it&#39;s unusual that kids
would be wrong and adults would be
right. I think that they are wrong. I
think that we&#39;re right. Um but I want I
want to hear out your you know the best
arguments for my daughter&#39;s case cuz she
frankly wasn&#39;t making it.
She&#39;s like I want to be able to text my
friends in class. I&#39;m like that&#39;s not a
good argument.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No we don&#39;t want that. We don&#39;t want
that. She&#39;s like only in when we have
breaks though.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uhhuh. Well, of course.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, here&#39;s the thing. First of all, no
one wants their kids or no one wants any
kids on their phone during class
distracted. Like, no one no normal
person would make that argument. She
agrees with that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s Yeah. Um and and there&#39;s a big
sort of uh a wide range of options
between laws uh that are often enforced
by campus resource officers, police, and
we can get into that verse rules or
norms or you know other ways of sort of
like curtailing cell phone behavior use
during class. So um my my opposition is
specifically to the laws. you know, if
schools if if teachers want to have
certain policies, if they want, you
know, everyone to put their phone in a
basket or these little pocket things
that they make now for classrooms, um,
you know, that&#39;s totally fine. I think
that&#39;s great. I would encourage teachers
to kind of cultivate their own learning
environments. Um, but I think once we
get into these blanket laws, there can
be a lot of unintended effects and I
think that we are not discussing a lot
of those uh unintended effects and
specifically I&#39;m concerned with uh the
sort of civil liberties um implications
with with some of the laws.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So yeah, if you could flesh out what
some of the civil liberties implications
of that might be. I think Ryan and I are
both on the same page. Particularly Ryan
has done reporting on this over the
years about how some of the unintended
consequences of sweeping laws that are
uh you they&#39;re able to be implemented.
They get the political permission
structure to be implemented by lawmakers
because they&#39;re addressing a serious
problem and then the attempt to address
a serious problem has unintended
consequences because they&#39;re able to do
the power grab. Uh everyone was sort of
desperate for some type of solution. So
I don&#39;t object to the idea that there
may be unintended consequences here.
Tell us a little bit about what you
think they might be, Taylor. Yeah. So,
we&#39;ve had tech bans in the past, and I
would say the closest correlary to this
is actually the beeper ban. Um, this was
a little before my time, but uh, back in
the early 90s, there was this really big
panic about beepers. Kids had the
beepers going off in class. Like, pagers
were a new thing. This was a big
distraction at school, and there was a
lot of concern about beepers and, you
know, it was the implication was that
people use beepers for like drug use.
So, there was this moral panic around
them. Um, we saw how those laws played
out where basically hundreds of kids
ended up having interactions with
police. Some kids ended up with criminal
records. In one Chicago school, dozens
of kids were arrested. Um, and kids were
just having these these regular
interactions with the police already. I
talked to a parent um in LA just last
week who was talking about this exact
issue where the teachers rightfully in
certain environments don&#39;t want to
enforce these bans or the
administrators. And we have an
increasing number of police in school,
campus resource officers, which has
actually skyrocketed since the days of
those beeper bans. And those are often
the people that are sort of tasked with
enforcing these bans. So it ends up just
being this quite discriminatory policy
where they just sort of harass kids.
They um you know, and it just it leads
to more interactions with kids and
police. So I&#39;m sort of against that. Um,
I also think that we have to look at
this law in the context of this broader
legislative and political effort that
we&#39;re seeing right now to restrict kids
from access to the internet. And I can
get into that more broadly, but I think
a lot of people have been sort of
talking about things like age
verification and these other things. And
this law is very much tied like these
laws rather are very much tied in this
broader political effort to sort of
censor the internet.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And before we go into some of that, I
wanted to get you to address the related
um controversy that you&#39;re that you&#39;re
inside now. Um you&#39;ve been going back
and forth with a couple people on
Twitter, including uh Rachel Cohen Booth
um who who uh flagged Maybe we can put
up uh what do we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decided to say that I was paid by a
phone company. I am not paid by a phone
company. Never have been paid by a phone
company. Uh I don&#39;t know what like that
really bothered me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You did you did put up the tag ped
Well, let&#39;s let&#39;s put out her in their
case and then have you respond to it.
Their case is that so you did a Tik Tok
for uh that you that about bark which is
a you can tell us
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; child safety software. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the post it said hashtag ad and it
had a link that had a long code at the
end of it and you said
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tracking code.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Tracking code. You said you&#39;re doing
this in partnership
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh with Bark. So people the screenshot
we had right there did have the tag paid
partnership which I think is oh my god
no such a derailing thing the way that
on Tik Tok and I understand for people
that don&#39;t use Tik Tok they don&#39;t
understand this there&#39;s only one way to
tag promotional content so you click
promotional content on Tik Tok it comes
up as paid and that just means that the
brand can put money behind it doesn&#39;t
mean that you got money I&#39;ve been extra
extra careful where even things that I&#39;m
not paid for I&#39;ll mark it as promotional
because I am making something
promotional like, &#34;Hey, I really like
this product.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But me making a pro like free promotion
for child safety software that I use
that by the way is completely is
unrelated and is actually on the same
side as you guys on these bands is just
so absurd and ridiculous. And I think it
just shows the the attempt that people
will go to to sort of smear and attempt
to discredit anybody that even raises
issues with this. I have been reporting
on this topic for eight years. Like I&#39;ve
been writing about all of these laws, uh
the broader political effort. I&#39;ve been
talking about people like Jonathan
Height who are going into these school
districts and specifically uh lobbying
for these laws, the interest groups
around that. This is something that I&#39;ve
covered for a long time. And I&#39;m
actually, you know what? Who&#39;s actually
paying me is this uh is this program,
this reporters and residence program
that I&#39;m in right now where I&#39;m
specifically I got into the program
talking about covering these laws.
That&#39;s what I like am being paid for is
basically this fellowship program. So
it&#39;s just very silly. But um but yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you did post screen or somebody posted
screenshots of the company saying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, the company has said many times on
the record she&#39;s not paid. But but it&#39;s
like I think people will just jump to
anything where they just kind of want to
make up a narrative because they want to
discredit this issue and this is very
normal in moral panics. We write a lot
about moral panics and I&#39;m not saying
that necessarily kids being on their
phone in class is a moral panic but this
issue is very tied to uh a broader moral
panic about cell phones where people are
convinced that they&#39;re you know making
kids sort of mass uh unal alive
themselves and things like that not to
use YouTube learning Lego.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You could see why people thought from
the way that it was presented.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of course. Of course. But also like well
of course I can understand like people
getting confused but at that point you
have me responding and I was at a
funeral that day so I didn&#39;t have the
chance to respond quite so quickly as
people might have liked. Um but and then
the company issuing multiple statements
saying uh you know this is just not the
case. You&#39;ve misunderstood the
situation. But you know
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; okay well so the question on the moral
panic um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it just it does seem to me well first of
all just in my own life I&#39;m not a kid
anymore. My brain is better formed than
kids which are still developing. But
even myself since smartphones have come
around. I I think I read less. Um I do I
do more audio books. Um I I used to be
able to sit down and read, you know, 10
20 30 pages at a stretch and then take a
little break or something. Now it&#39;s like
a page and a half and I find myself like
distracted or scrolling. Um,
combine that with the rates of anxiety
and depression that we&#39;re seeing this
society. Why are we like why are we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to link these,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you could combine that with the rate of
baggy pants, Ryan, and you would find
also a correlation. Um, that doesn&#39;t
mean that actually skinnier in that
period of time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Skinny pants. Um, so what I would
caution people against is making these
broad-based sort of conclusions. We
actually had quite literally
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m not distracted from the book to like
look at my baggy pants like distracted.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But you are but you are making that
correlation that just does not exist in
research. And we have the top the top
top top researchers uh people like
Candace who wrote a great piece for the
Atlantic uh on this exact topic. uh
Alice Marwick, like people that have
studied this this issue in in depth for
years and years and years coming out and
saying, &#34;Hey, we actually do know the
cause of some of these broader issues,
anxiety, all of these other things.&#34; Um,
we know those causes and and they&#39;re not
related to phones. There is no
correlation between those things and it
it is just a fact based on the research
that we have that that is just not a
sort of a clear correlation. Um, that&#39;s
not to say that Ryan,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what does she say they are?
Oh gosh, you&#39;ll have to read her piece.
It&#39;s kind of long and I don&#39;t want to
mess it up, but um but all sorts of
things. I mean, one in six kids is
growing up below the poverty line. Like
um I don&#39;t know, just all of these other
things that kids are dealing with. Like
they&#39;re growing up in a pretty stressful
world. And they&#39;re told just the way
that I was told that video games were,
you know, destroying our lives back in,
you know, when I was growing up, we had
the video game sort of panic where
people were like, &#34;Oh, these kids spend
hours and hours on the video games. It&#39;s
destroying their mental health. it&#39;s
making them violent. Like we&#39;ve seen
these moral panics play out over and
over and over again. That doesn&#39;t mean
that that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone has
a healthy relationship with their phone
and you shouldn&#39;t worry. What we know is
that the way that you are can often
inform your behavior. So if you are
already depressed and you go down a
rabbit hole that can exacerbate it or
whatever, but it is sort of like it is
more a symptom rather than the problem.
And when we&#39;re treating it as the
problem rather than the symptom of the
problem, we don&#39;t ever get to address
the sort of core issues. And often and
there are core issues that sort of lead
to these mental health issues among
children. And that again that does not
mean that they should be able to sit on
uh the cell phones all day. But what I
would say is a lot of this moral panic
is tied to content.
So you&#39;ll see these people saying like
they&#39;re going to sit on Tik Tok all day,
right? They&#39;re going to sit in class all
day like on TikTok. And the concern is
more about the content and the sort of
villainizing of short form video
content. Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well, yeah, I was going to say I don&#39;t
disagree with you because you shared a a
substack that&#39;s been going pretty viral,
I think, from somebody who like
disagrees with you on a lot of different
things. And I someone had sent that to
me uh separately as well. And it&#39;s about
how the argument is that these bans are
a way to shoehorn sort of content bans.
And I don&#39;t actually disagree that
that&#39;s probably the case with some
people that it&#39;s kind of a gateway to
age verification laws and certain things
that do genuinely encroach on civil
liberties and creativity and freedom and
all of that. I want to get your take
though on I mean I&#39;m looking at I have I
have three studies pulled up. one from
plus one uh one from scientific reports
and this other one is from um I don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just want to say before you pull up
any studies we have to look at the body
of research and we have to look at how
and I don&#39;t I can&#39;t speak to these
specific studies
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but what I would say is that all of the
top researchers on this topic this
specific topic got together last year
and issued an 82page report surveying
the overwhelming amount of sort of
studies on this topic and debunked this
a lot of misleading studies pushed by
this man Jonathan height which is sort
of this most popular
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; person I&#39;m not even going to get into
height here the other one here is from
the journal of association for consumer
research and I&#39;m not I mean I&#39;m not an
expert on this so I&#39;m just saying these
are these are studies not about anxiety
or any of that this is a study that
shows and this is particular to the
phone ban issue I think it&#39;s it&#39;s
salient um separately that showed the
kind of brain drain phenomenon I think
we all probably feel this intuitively or
maybe you disagree which is that uh
after as you&#39;re doing studies even
having a phone near you, even if it&#39;s
like flipped down, reduces cognitive
capacity. And so on the question of
whether or not uh it&#39;s it&#39;s proper for a
school district to say we&#39;re locking
these guys up in yonder pouches from the
beginning of the school day to the end
of the school day, it seems to me that
addresses the very specific question of
whether kids cognitive capacity is
harmed while they&#39;re learning because
their phone&#39;s in their backpack.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But like these studies are so
dubious like often these are industry
stud like or they&#39;re funded by people
with specific political agendas like etc
etc. You also have to consider this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about the big tech funded studies that
go in the other direction
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but there&#39;s tons of non big tech funded
studies and again you have to look at
the overwhelming body of research and
the overwhelming body of research
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the cognitive capacity question. What
about the cognitive capacity question?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The cognitive capacity question is is a
good question but here&#39;s the thing that
you have to consider. All of these
school districts are different. And this
is again, I&#39;m not saying that this means
kids can be on their phone all day in
class. I&#39;m just against these laws where
certain places you put the you put the
phone away, but you&#39;re on a laptop.
You&#39;re on a really high functioning
great laptop and that&#39;s totally fine and
you&#39;re sort of connected. A lot of
school districts, the phone is the only
word processor people have. When you
start to block them away, you&#39;re, you
know, 15% of kids are disabled. A lot of
kids use these as learning aids. Um, and
I know that&#39;s hard to believe, but a lot
of times the phone is the only sort of
computer that kids have in school. And
we haven&#39;t even gotten into this yet,
but because of big tech lobbying and
other things, we have had um and because
we just are trying to in prepare kids
for the modern world, we have integrated
technology into every part of the
learning process. And so sort of sort of
and just our lives and sort of sort of
take this one piece away without
addressing and without having any
funding. These laws don&#39;t come with like
funding initiatives or whatever to fix
the broader infrastructure. It sort of
just leaves kids less prepared. I would
also say we want to teach kids restraint
and control. We want to teach kids what
we don&#39;t want is for them to go off when
they&#39;re 18 to college and not know how
to self-regulate their own technological
use, right? We want to give them a safe
environment where there are guard rails
where they&#39;re not allowed to sit on the
phone all day long, but where we can
teach them restraint. Otherwise, it&#39;s
you&#39;re just prolonging the inevitable
because phones, as much as this
political effort is trying, are not
going to be banned from public life
hopefully anytime soon for adults and or
the workplace. And so we we we want to
encourage a healthy relationship with
tech, if that makes sense.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It always has struck me as odd that
schools are filled with all of these
different electronic devices
and they focus on this one thing. Still
on the other hand,
you don&#39;t think there So what from your
perspective, what do the studies say
about the effect of screens on
developing brains and on kids?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Um well, there&#39;s that&#39;s a big
there&#39;s a big question, right? Because
you have like if you talk about screens
on developing brains, like you don&#39;t
want to put a one-year-old in front of a
screen all day, like YouTube all day or
something. But um but but
overwhelmingly, I mean, I think Candace
Rogers has really just been the best.
and I encourage people to seek out her
work and Alice Marwick. These are two
brilliant researchers that have really
spoken about this at length. Um, but
this idea of like screen time and the
panic over screen time is just very
imprecise. And the reason that the
studies don&#39;t show anything is because
it completely depends what your screen
time is. You could be using your screen
time to consume content uh that is
making you feel bad or something or you
could be using your screen time to text
your friends and be creative and make
creative work. it we we want people to
do the latter. We want to teach kids to
use their phone in healthy and creative
ways. And when we tell the kids,
especially when the primary way that
kids use their phone is through texting,
the primary way that kids use social
media is actually DMing with each other.
It&#39;s not scrolling the feed. Adam Msari
came out and even said that. So, we
don&#39;t want to villainize communication.
We want kids to stay in in healthy,
productive communication with each other
and not bully each other and have
positive experiences with each other and
have social interaction, especially
queer kids, you know, kids that are from
marginalized groups who rely on these
online connections a lot more than other
kids. Um, but we just want to give them
a healthy way to do that and teach them
boundaries. And the best way to do that
is to teach it to them when they&#39;re
young, not to completely ban devices
until they turn 18 and then it&#39;s a
complete free-for-all. It&#39;s just not
that&#39;s not an effective way to teach
anybody h healthy media consumption.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What about parents who let me try this
one out what about parents who say they
don&#39;t actually they don&#39;t give their
kids phones. They don&#39;t want their kids
to have phones. They worry they they
read the studies differently. They have
different perspective on it and they
don&#39;t want their kids to be exposed to
phones at all. So the bands then uh
allow those parents to allow their kids
to have a phone-free childhood without
then getting shown something in between
classes that actually from the content
perspective may be harmful. Uh maybe
maybe take your example of maybe it&#39;s a
a queer kid and someone shows something
on the phone between classes that uh is
is harmful to their mental health and
their parents want to be able to prevent
that. How would why not allow parents to
let their kids that let make that
decision for their own kids? uh because
you can&#39;t control that between classes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, but what I would say is that that&#39;s
a that&#39;s a you should be careful with
that decision. We know actually that the
mental health of kids that have the
smartphone sooner is is is actually more
positive. Like they have better mental
health because they&#39;re able to get in
touch with friends. And ironically, it&#39;s
also been found that like poorer kids
have access to phones much more easily
than richer kids. So it&#39;s not explained
by, you know, income. Um and that is
because they&#39;re able to keep in touch
with friends. uh you know there&#39;s a
study that that came out that recently
found that as well that like kids
actually spent more time outside with
you know with friends because they were
able to make plans. So you want kids to
be able to communicate with friends.
This idea of this like phoneree
childhood again we live in a a world I
know that there&#39;s these political
efforts the people that are selling the
phone free childhood idea they&#39;re also
pushing a lot of other reactionary
political efforts that would censor
adult adults from content too. They want
to go to a world before phones and
before the internet.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I admit to that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, me too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And well guys, let me tell you there&#39;s a
lot of bad about the internet and I&#39;ve
written about bullying and trust me I am
no one is saying I just have to
reiterate this again that you should
have unmitigated access to, you know,
your cell phone all day when you&#39;re 13
years old. You have to teach healthy
internet use. But we live in the world
and if you want your kids to be
competitive and if you want your kids to
be able to function and have a job and
make it through college, you do need to
teach them these skills. And I
understand the fights that come with it.
But the way that we can fight these
addictive, you know, algorithms and I
think the problems that a lot of people
have with the phones in terms of the
content is through comprehensive data
privacy reform. You want less addictive
algorithms. You want less predatory
apps. You want less control of big tech
and more uh nonprofit driven online
spaces that are about community. join me
in advocating for privacy laws and data,
you know, data privacy specifically that
we will never get those laws if these if
this political effort to ban the phones
and age restrict everything is
successful
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because and let me just say one other
thing. At the same time that they are um
banning phones, they are, you know, do
these schools are doing partnerships
with surveillance software companies
that will do facial recognition to
determine who&#39;s allowed to be on campus
and who&#39;s not, harvesting detailed
biometric data on children. Like all of
this stuff that could have significantly
worse consequences for them down the
line. I saw Yeah, I saw a couple of
months ago you write about those studies
that you just referenced and that was
one of the first times where I was like,
&#34;Oh, this is this is kind of
interesting.&#34; You you did a piece about
how the studies were showing that kids
that didn&#39;t have access to phones at all
like had worse mental health outcomes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that&#39;s also the collective action,
right? Because if you need to have a
cell phone to make plans with your
friend, it&#39;s because your friend,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Right. So,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I think there&#39;s a balance. I just
think there&#39;s a balance here and I just
think before we jump to laws that will
be enforced by campus police officers,
we should have a more balanced
discussion of what we&#39;re trying to
achieve and what the realistic
trade-offs are because there are
realistic trade-offs here, you know, not
to mention the the problems with parents
and shift work and school, you know,
there&#39;s just so many down the line
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, then so from your perspective,
final question, what should what should
parents do?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh god. Um, I think it depends on the
type of school that you have and it
depends on your child&#39;s educ educational
environment and who your child is and
how they&#39;re using their phone. I am
against like I I am against, you know,
again just like giving your kid
completely unsupervised internet time
and unsupervised phone time forever.
Obviously, you want to slowly introduce
and the reason I was talking in the
first place for free about like child,
you know, protection software is because
it sort of allows parents to have a
little bit more control over their kids
online experience. I think um it&#39;s good
to introduce kids to phones. I think
having restrictions, parental
restrictions, taking it away during
certain times of the day, teaching them
moderation and how to work with phones
and use their phone in a healthy way and
communicate in a healthy way um is
helpful. And just that&#39;s that&#39;s broad
the internet. That&#39;s the other thing is
that like these phone conversations are
going to be irrelevant. Kids have Apple
watches, smart glasses. The internet is
getting more and more integrated into
every part of our life. We&#39;re going to
have wearables soon. So, we have to we
have to help kids have this healthy
relationship with the internet while
they&#39;re still young.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, Ryan is an elder millennial, but as
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, I was in school during the
Beeper thing. Uh, and yeah, it was like
pitched largely as about drug dealers
and it&#39;s like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; kind of drug dealers like getting pinged
in class
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about one, but I was just going to say
as a junior millennial, my high school
was cut in half by the smartphone. And I
fully fully concede to being part of a
moral panic and somewhat proudly concede
to be a moral panic. a much much
different side of this uh than you are,
Taylor, but we appreciate you uh coming
here and making the case and allowing us
to have this discussion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, thank you for having me. And
please don&#39;t please don&#39;t destroy me
online. I&#39;m just trying to add a little
nuance to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tell people tell people where they can
find your work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I&#39;m on YouTube um at Taylor Loren.
I have a series called Free Speech
Friday where I talk about civil
liberties uh concerns and tech policy.
So, I talk about this stuff uh
specifically and I&#39;m everywhere else
just at Taylor Lauren. Well, thank you
so much for coming on.
