Hey everybody, Tim Miller from the
Bullwwork here with my colleague
Jonathan V last. Um he&#39;s got a
newsletter out today. It&#39;s the best
newsletter in the business. You got to
go sign up for it at the bowwork.com.
And uh it is about uh this big push in
the MAGA world to
rationalize Trump&#39;s tariff regime saying
that uh uh we are going to have 4
trillion in deficit reduction as a
result of this. I exciting. I have to
admit uh I&#39;m happy you wrote this deep
dive newsletter because this is kind of
like been in my field of vision, but I
just it starts to I see CBO and 4
trillion and the ter and I it just it
starts to get I just move on. I&#39;m like I
can&#39;t like this like it all just feels
like a farago of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and I just and
I and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care.
But here here&#39;s the gist of it if you
have um have missed it and then J can
explain what exactly is happening here.
Trump posted, I guess this was what over
the weekend, um that he&#39;s pleased to
announce that the radical left
representatives at the CBO, so he takes
a hit at the CBO, have now admitted how
incredible my tariff strategy has been,
saying that Trump&#39;s tariffs reduce the
deficit by $4 trillion.
Um da da da. He goes on and on. This
that means we&#39;re the hottest country in
the world. Thank you for your attention
to this matter. So So talk to us about
that. What is he talking about? What is
a CBO report? What is the truth?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, it&#39;s all it&#39;s all [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
And what happened is CBO puts out a
report on Friday and it is a revised
income from tariffs for for 2025. And
what CBO says is they said our initial
uh read on total revenue from tariffs
which we conducted on January 6th, so
before Trump came into office, the
initial read was that they would get $80
billion in revenue from tariffs in
fiscal year 2025. So Trump comes in, he
does liberation day, tariff rates all go
up like crazy, and they now say that
we&#39;re at about $136 billion in revenues
taken from tariffs. and projecting out
to 200 billion by the end of this year,
2025. And CBO then says, &#34;And if
everything stays exactly the same as it
is now until 2035,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when is that?&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2035.
So, uh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; God willing, we&#39;re all still here and
that the singularity hasn&#39;t happened.
But, uh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we should be so lucky. uh then we will
have saved $4 trillion
uh which we can we can apply those
revenues be applied to the deficit. Now
this is crazy for all sorts of reasons.
One of which is that Trump changes the
tariffs like every nine days,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? So this is the the assumption
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; projecting it out 10 years that with
static tariff rates,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? I mean you can&#39;t even project on
like in all seriousness, you can&#39;t even
really project it out two weeks, right?
Because he&#39;s doing deals. He&#39;s, you
know, he&#39;s doing deals left and right
and who knows what they&#39;re all going to
be. Um, so it&#39;s crazy. And this is why
you want So right now in MAGA world,
everyone is like, Trump just got us $4
trillion. Yeah, let&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] go. And
you know, the fake news mainstream media
won&#39;t report it. Why won&#39;t they talk
about how he got us $4 trillion? And the
answer is the reason is because the
report is is [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that there&#39;s the
report is premised on this idea that is
impossible, right? These rates are not
going to be in effect until 2035. They
just won&#39;t. And so that&#39;s why nobody&#39;s
reporting about it. But but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; disagrees with you. I do want to I do
want to tell you he says that um
wherever you are on the quote Trump
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CBO analysis validates the president&#39;s
belief in tariffs as an essential tool
of economic renewal as well as state
craft and exposes the fundamental
misapprehension of the topic by pretty
much everyone on the left and the right.
Hugh Hewitt. Yeah. Yeah, this proves the
fact that we will have this 4 trillion.
I I hear your point about how it&#39;s
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that like this will this is
will not ever actually happen and well
you can&#39;t project out 10 years etc etc.
But let&#39;s just say you could like let&#39;s
just say you could right like 4 trillion
like doesn&#39;t even pay for the tax bill.
So this is what we&#39;re going to get to,
right? So it it&#39;s much it&#39;s all much
stupider than this even, right? And so
uh the the big beautiful bill was going
to increase the deficit by 4.1 trillion
over the next 10 years. And so even if
the CBO stuff, even if President Trump
for life is still, he keeps everything
steady as she goes from here on in till
2035 before Baron takes over, uh he&#39;s
still already more than spent all of
that money. But the other thing is
again, so where does that money come
from? Like it doesn&#39;t come from Sony and
Toyota and Volkswagen. It comes from us
because tariffs are a tax,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? The the manufacturers might pay
the tariff.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s just a regressive tax shift. Like,
right, even if you take him at his word
and you&#39;re like, we have a $4 trillion
tax cut that that disproportionately
helps people at the top.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not entirely. And we&#39;re going to replace
that with 4 trillion in tariffs that
we&#39;re getting from consumers
disproportionately like lower middle
lower middle class like regular
consumers. Like that&#39;s like all it&#39;s
just a it&#39;s a straight shift from the
middle class to the rich. Like there&#39;s
no deficit benefit on balance. Like even
like it&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] But even if it
happened as it as as they&#39;re arguing
like that&#39;s all it is. It&#39;s just a
transfer of money from the middle class.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s just more wealth transfer. And and
the other thing is that uh it also makes
a bunch of assumptions uh for instance
that there is no inflation right it
which if you go and read all the way
down to the bottom of the report which
clearly Trump didn&#39;t do and Hugh Hewitt
didn&#39;t do uh they say of course there
are a bunch of near-term negative
effects and among those negative effects
they say you know uh economic
productivity in America is going to
decline inflation is going to rise.
We&#39;re seeing both of those things
already. We had first quarter this this
year was negative GDP growth which is
insane. Um the producer price index is
way up. Uh the Fed is really worried
about inflation. So like
the CBO report which Trump is growing
about has a bunch of warnings about
things that are happening right now
which they ignore. And then it has a
bunch of just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about things that
might happen in a decade if by some
chance nothing changes. And that&#39;s what
they focus on. And it&#39;s like the biggest
piece of fake news. Like I I hate to be
reduced to using the term fake news, but
that&#39;s I don&#39;t know what else to call
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve got to give a contrary
view. Let&#39;s let&#39;s listen to another
perspective. As you know, the stock
market went up almost a thousand points
on Friday. And it went up not because of
uh this very uh I think terrible Hello.
Who&#39;s that? Who is that back there? Get
out of the room.
It went up because of something much
different. It went up because uh it was
announced CBO announced the numbers and
as you know they gave no credit to
tariffs. They said they made a mistake
that the trade deficit will be reduced
because of Trump&#39;s tariffs will re be
reduced by$4 trillion dollars. Right? Is
that what they said? Right. They said $4
trillion. And the market went up like a
rocket ship because the tariffs are
good. Well, tariffs aren&#39;t that usual.
If the seven wars I stopped, four of
them were because of the fact that I had
tariffs on trade. And I was able to say,
&#34;Well, if you do this, if you go fight
and if you want to kill everybody,
that&#39;s okay, but I&#39;m going to charge you
each 100% tariff when you trade with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There you go. I&#39;m sorry, JVL. The
president has said so one market sword.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And he he even says, &#34;We&#39;re reducing the
trade deficit.&#34; That&#39;s the other weird
thing. Like, so here he is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s talking
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking he&#39;s
not talking about the budget deficit.
Now he&#39;s talking about the trade
deficit. And it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to know what
the hell is happening here, but this is
the president of the United States and
all of these policies are being made by
whatever flits through the front of his
brain pan while a camera is rolling.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like that&#39;s just how all the policies
being made. And I&#39;m sorry over at the
CBO, you guys will have to, you know,
somebody will say something to him at a
meeting and he&#39;ll have to he&#39;ll redraw
the tariff on Finland and you&#39;ll have to
go and run the numbers again in 3 days.
Well, I&#39;ve got some good news though for
the people at the CBO is um they&#39;ve
bought themselves a lifeline here. You
know, Trump&#39;s out there firing Fed
governors, like random people in the
defense department who like, you know,
made, you know, off-hand comments about
how we&#39;re maybe over focusing on China
versus other threats. They&#39;re out. You
know, people at random boards are out
because they because Laura Loomer came
from them. CBO&#39;s got like a lifeline
here, a little cover now. Trump thinks
that the radical leftist at the CBO did
something that he likes, even though
they really didn&#39;t exactly. Um, but you
know, that means that we&#39;re gonna have a
congressional budget office of actual
professionals still for at least
another, I don&#39;t know, month
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or two, even if things go well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, thrilling stuff. Uh, everybody,
