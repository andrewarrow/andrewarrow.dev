<li>John W Anderson was a major slave trader in Kentucky during the 1820s and 1830s who operated from a 100-acre farm with a converted log building as a slave pen</li>
<li>The Anderson slave pen was moved to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati in 2002 and became a centerpiece exhibit when the museum opened in 2004</li>
<li>Archaeological excavation revealed the building was originally constructed around 1804-1810 as a domestic house by Moses Frazee, then converted to a slave jail by Anderson around 1832</li>
<li>The barred windows were stamped "Schoenberger" from a Pittsburgh company that didn't open until 1832, providing crucial dating evidence for the conversion to a slave pen</li>
<li>Anderson's name was found stamped on a second-floor log, indicating he likely raised the roof from one and a half to two stories during the conversion</li>
<li>Between 1830-1834, Anderson made regular trips to Natchez and New Orleans, transporting enslaved people, horses, and produce, making $38,000 in sales (equivalent to $1.2 million today)</li>
<li>Anderson died suddenly in 1834 at age 41, with local legends claiming he died while chasing an escaping enslaved person</li>
<li>Henry Bibb was born around 1815 in Shelby County, Kentucky, and became a successful freedom seeker and prominent abolitionist after escaping to Canada</li>
<li>Bibb made multiple escape attempts throughout the 1820s and 1830s, often returning to try to free his wife Melinda and daughter Frances before they were sold to Louisiana</li>
<li>After successfully escaping to Canada in 1842, Bibb learned to read and write, became an educated abolitionist speaker, and published his autobiography in 1848</li>
<li>Bibb published "The Voice of The Fugitive" newspaper from Sandwich, Ontario in 1851, becoming an important voice in the abolitionist movement</li>
<li>The Refugees Home Society, which Bibb helped establish, purchased 2,000 acres of land and provided 25-acre plots to 40 escaped slaves near Windsor, Canada by 1854</li>
<li>Archaeological work at the Gatewood Farm in Trimble County, Kentucky (Bibb's last place of enslavement) has been ongoing since 2005 through the Oldham County History Center</li>
<li>Excavations at the Gatewood Farm revealed evidence of enslaved quarters including a pit cellar, burned hearth area, and artifacts like blue glass beads associated with enslaved communities</li>
<li>Both sites demonstrate the dual nature of Kentucky slavery - Anderson's operation as a major export hub for the Deep South slave trade, and the Gatewood Farm representing the lived experience of enslaved people</li>
<li>The research satisfies Kentucky's statewide archaeological objectives and contributes to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, being one of only 14 listings in Kentucky</li>
<li>Public archaeology projects like these rely on federal grants, museum funding, and volunteer participation to document and preserve important slavery heritage sites</li>
<li>The Anderson slave pen operated as a jail for only about two years (1832-1834), but Anderson was a legend and cautionary tale in Mason County for generations afterward</li>

okay hi everyone I&#39;m really glad to be
here tonight and we are going to talk
about two faces of Kentucky slavery
first we&#39;re going to talk about John W
Anderson who was a slave trader in the
1820s and 1830s and Henry Bibb who was a
freedom Seeker
an abolitionist
1830s to 1850s
so our trivia question we do have two
uh the first trivia question has to do
with John W Anderson and you can see the
on the I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s your lash
but the one with the Bard windows
those Barn Windows have a name on them
and the question is the bars on the
Windows date to what year
and the answer will be in the
talk here in a little while
and the second one is Henry Bibb lived
in what city in Canada finally made it
to Canada
we&#39;re going to start we&#39;ll come back to
those at the end we&#39;re going to start
with John W Anderson
this is a black and white image of the
Anderson slave pen after the outer Barn
was taken off and we&#39;ll go into the
history of that here shortly National
Underground Railroad Freedom Center in
Cincinnati moved the Anderson slave pen
to become a centerpiece exhibit I was
actually moved in 2002 so it was in the
building when it opened
in 2004.
and here is uh early relatively early
image of the reconstructed slave pen
inside the Freedom Center and when we
get to talking about the archeology if
you notice the um
stones in the corners and along the
sides those are actual stones from the
site we actually tagged and numbered the
stones as well as the logs
here is the location of it this is Route
10 route the a I guess it&#39;s nine the
double A Highway&#39;s about two miles to
the North and then this is Walton Pike
coming down here to meet Route 10 and
here is the property as it stood in 2002
there is a house here that was built by
one of Anderson&#39;s daughters and the
um jail building itself is back here on
the second Hill to the back so it was
not visible from any of the roads and if
you see that this different
squares and things here this Square
is a hundred acres and that&#39;s going to
be the important one that we&#39;ll talk
about these are different Parcels that
were added at a later date
when we first went out there you
couldn&#39;t see it because it&#39;s inside this
barn but you can see in the roof you
look at the roof line here
this differences here this is where it
is inside
the building that&#39;s my old truck
here&#39;s a different shot of it looking uh
from a distance
and uh this image is inside the barn you
can see some of the stones from the
chimney and uh the corner Piers uh the
chimney itself had been removed a long
time ago to provide access to use it as
a Tobacco Barn
so you can kind of see the setting out
here on the hill
so they receive federal funds in
um early 2002 to pay for the exhibit
uh and to pay for moving the slave pen
and we had three tests as a result of
that one was to document the building
two was to do archeology and three ways
to do research
so we&#39;ll run through some of that real
quick until we can get to
John W Anderson himself and how we found
out about him
these are just a few images just
familiar with uh the condition that it
was in this was actually taken after the
outer Barn was taken off and you see
that the floor had been had collapsed uh
a previous owner had let cows run
through it
um and you can see how it&#39;s kind of out
of Plum here uh because of the chimney
being moved and at some point I think in
the 1970s uh a previous owner had
removed one of the barred windows and
sold it
to a collector so it was missing a
you can see the other
barred windows
there&#39;s another shot of it from the
chimney end after
the outer Barn had been removed these
are later supports put up to hold it up
the outer Tobacco Barn
uh original log
uh logs had Stone filling and then
um kind of mud plaster chinking
and uh and big Corner piers
just some more pictures of it showing
um saddle or V notching uh the humongous
chimney base this is a 10 foot by 10
foot chimney base
once we were able to excavate it
um here&#39;s a picture of one of the corner
The Bard windows were built all in one
with an outer frame board nailed to the
log separately from the frame
the inner frame was spiked through the
outer board into the logs
and the Bars were inserted into that
framework so they could not be moved or
pushed out or taken out
so we&#39;ve we figured one person built all
of those and then they were inserted
into the building
and we&#39;ll come back to them later
here&#39;s another picture showing the log
starting to be removed
a stack they were uh tagged and taken
off one by one
here&#39;s a shot another shot of the end
as we started to uncover the chimney all
this white is not snow that is lime
there were a bunch of big bags of lime
that had piled up there
um so it was quite a mess
here&#39;s after the building itself was
removed and all that was left were the
floor joists they were log joists but it
kind of looked like a big ship
at this point because they had all
rotted and collapsed in the middle
so all that was removed
all right so this is a little bit closer
up map get us reoriented again
here is the slave building itself
this is uh the outer Barn is the dashed
and the solid rectangle is the area we
were limited to excavate in once we
finally actually started Excavating so
the bigger field here
Anderson Cemetery here Anderson is
buried there John W Anderson his wife
um his parents
um several of his daughters various
other people are buried in that Cemetery
steep slope down to a stream
out here uh there&#39;s a brick scatter that
turned out to be Anderson&#39;s house
and we had done these are all shovel
tests we&#39;ve done small test fits all
over the property black dots are where
we found early 19th century artifacts
and then the landowner when it came time
to actually excavate would not let us
excavate out here and so we were pretty
much limited to right inside this
so we pretty much excavated the whole
thing so as best as we could try to get
as much information as we could
I don&#39;t know
I&#39;m trying to go to the next slide
bear with me it is not going up or down
all right
are you all still there
yep we can still hear you okay all right
I was hoping somebody could hear me
there we go it it was not looking moved
um the slide so we&#39;re back all right
this is a before view of the West Side
um that concrete block wall is part of
the outer Barn you can see all the dirt
here and this is after we excavated it
the same view
pretty intense peers on this house
that you can see here
&#39;s another view of that massive chimney
base you see how deep it went into the
um 10 feet wide
another view of the piers
this is the door the original building
only had one door it&#39;s a tall narrow
door I&#39;m seeing iron bar across here we
believe that the original door was a
regular door with a transom window
above it um Anderson put that bar in
um this doorknob which is way bigger
than it actually is it&#39;s only about
um two inches in diameter
was found just down here below the
and it is an early very early 19th
um brass doorknob
we&#39;ll get back to why that&#39;s interesting
in a moment
there&#39;s some examples of some of the
artifacts from the site
uh we have some
blown glass we have panels we&#39;ve got
Washington&#39;s hair we have a flasks a lot
of the early decorated Ceramics we have
um some 18
40s 30s and 40s Ceramics which are after
the time period of when Anderson was a
slave dealer and that&#39;ll be interesting
in a minute as well and the Caledonia
pattern we have two different colors of
the same pattern of a plate
which dates between 1830 and 1840 by
William Adams
and we&#39;re doing it again all right all
right nama
we have matches between the slave pen
and the house the artifacts we got
underneath the building and the
artifacts that we got out in the field
uh match
so whoever was living in the house was
also throwing trash away under the slave
lots of different
personal artifacts phones we have a
large penny
from 1831 this is a bone cone handle
all right so tail of a building
we&#39;re gonna kind of start at the
1804 a man named Moses Frazee bought 100
acres that&#39;s the square that I showed
you in the early slide of the map where
the slave pens in the middle of it he
got married within a year and he needed
a house
and we&#39;re pretty sure he built that
house uh as a house with this nice
narrow uh early 19th century doorway
with a fine brass doorknob
and he was widowed in the early 1820s
and in 1825 he sold 100 acres to John W
um these are just bullets Anderson&#39;s
extended family business of slavery and
horse racing
are all involved
um 1834 he died suddenly
uh Susan and his wife his widow and all
the girls he had five daughters
um we believe the building served as a
kitchen after that
1844 the daughter&#39;s fight over his land
in 1857 it sold out of the family
um while we have this slide uh
I&#39;m gonna read a couple of short pieces
of information
so the building may have been originally
one and a half stories in height and
we&#39;ll get to why we think that in a
minute at least one window with glass
window panes we have some very early
window glass
um trash disposal patterns indicate that
a small porch may have existed in front
of and extending North from the original
they also dispose of trash beneath the
initial inside the building exhibits
evidence of shelves and internal
division of the second floor we&#39;re not
sure if those dates are crazy or
Anderson&#39;s time period
Anderson bought the hundred acres in
1825 we think he probably lived in this
house to begin with and at some point
his parents worship and Miss Anaya
um also lived on the property and they
are buried in the cemetery
we believe he built the brick
mansion house and I caught that because
of a court case sometime after 1825 he
was certainly living there by the time
of his death in 1834 because his widow
claimed 100 acres as her home Farm
when she filed her dollar claim
in early 1835.
okay so
we&#39;re gonna go through here
um about John W Anderson uh before I run
out of time and have to switch over to
Henry Dibbs so we&#39;ll get through as much
of this as we can he was in the Kentucky
militia along with Thomas Marshall in
the War uh a friend also I think a
nephew of the um Supreme Court justice
during the War of 1812 on 18 in 1818
He&#39;s listed in a court case over
misplaced Hogs heads of tobacco
um on a flat boat trip to New Orleans
1823 he was a witness in a trial about a
slave in a flat boat trip with a guy
named Edward Stone who I have shown here
in bold
Edward Stone was a notorious slave
whose slaves killed him in 1826 on an
Ohio River flat boat trip
so we can&#39;t prove Anderson was selling
slaves in 1823 but he was certainly
involved with a pretty high profile
slave dealer at that time
so then he buys the property
in um 1825
so then after that he starts a series of
loans and borrowing money and
um various things like that and uh we
know all this
because after he died he died without a
then a whole bunch of people came
forward and filed lawsuits against his
we&#39;ll come back that in a minute so
he also had issues with slaves escaping
which good thing not good on the slaves
and most of it has to do we believe with
the people that he was transporting down
the river so in 1830
Jim and John escaped and this is the ad
that Anderson placed in the local paper
and I have a little blue highlighting on
a couple of places where according to
Anderson Jim had on when he went off a
horse lock in a small tongue chain of a
wagon to it
and John had on each of his ankles a
horse lock and a small Trace chain
so instead of using
regular chains he was using the kinds of
horse the chains of things that he would
have used on horses to attach to these
young men now I don&#39;t know hopefully
away I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know the answer to
uh I think that they were probably part
of what I call the slave deal gone bad
five days later
and this comes from a court case after
Anderson&#39;s death
um Anderson was taking quote unquote a
lot of negroes to Dover on November 15th
and the man and he got involved with a
man named James Kempy in a
um a purchase of of a person that did
not go well so
it&#39;s uh
complicated but I think that this is
probably connected
to that
so 1831 he borrowed ten thousand dollars
uh from John Marshall and paid it back
1831 he&#39;s involved in a court case in
New Orleans
um where guy sued him because an
enslaved woman died two months after she
was purchased
1832 he borrowed some more money from
Thomas Marshall
um and all this is in the lawsuits after
he died
so Anderson built up his slave export
business through late 1820s to early
1830s he became a major local dealer an
exporter of humans from Kentucky to the
Deep South
his plans included expansion and
continued increase of Revenue he made
one to two trips a year to either
Natchez or New Orleans
between 1830 and 1832.
uh enslaved uh persons horses and
produce such as wheat were the product
that he transported
1832 in November Anderson wrote a letter
to Thomas Marshall
um and it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a three-page
letter and I&#39;ve got a little bit of it
right here and the spelling is original
so I didn&#39;t change the the spelling but
in this
letter he lays out his business plan and
Anderson was not someone who in Mason
County for example he didn&#39;t go to the
courthouse on Fort days and buy enslaved
people there
and he lays this out and I bolted among
your friends and acquaintances I want
you to find out and purchase all the
Negroes you can of a certain description
you can read all this men and boys and
um how much he wants him to pay for them
and he says
you know
let them stay where they are if you
think there&#39;ll be no danger which I take
it to mean running away otherwise send
them to my house and my
care of them among your friends and
acquaintances I think you might pick up
15 or 20 and that will be as much money
as something I couldn&#39;t read we&#39;ll make
all year
his pattern was
to go to the pretty new and say I I
would like to purchase these people and
then he would take them to the farm and
keep them there
um he was ready to make a trip uh down
the river
and now he comes to the bars
the barred windows are stamped
Schoenberger
uh who was a company in Pittsburgh who
did not open until 1832.
The Bard Windows could not have gone in
until at least 1832. well we know we go
out to property in 1825 so I think that
the increasing problem of young people
trying to escape
probably prompted him to convert this
and we also found his name stamped on
the second floor
one of the logs on the second floor
Senator there&#39;s his name that&#39;s why we
think he might have raised the roof from
one and a half to two stores
all right three sales between November
1832 and may 1833 Anderson sold over 38
000 worth of persons and and I have two
thousand three dollars because that&#39;s
when we wrote the report but that 1.2
million is 2023 money so a lot of money
major Lexington slave dealers of the
same period only claimed sales in the
five thousand to eight thousand dollar
range Anderson was a major player in the
Kentucky to Natchez slave trade during
his lifetime
in the meantime he was still having
problems with escaping slaves two young
men in 1834 ran away in 1833 there are
more but
so Jim and John 18 30 1833 Carter
Emmanuel Hannah and Carolyn
are the four who ran away then
so when he died
July 23rd 1834 he had he didn&#39;t leave a
41 years old uh the local Legends
um say that he died chasing and escaping
slave uh that he fell off his horse and
was killed uh we don&#39;t know the truth of
that but that&#39;s the the story he only
owned this farm for nine years
but he was a legend and a scary tale in
Mason County ever since
so many many court cases fought against
his estate when he died there were 32
enslaved persons on the farm when
usually in the tax records there&#39;s less
than 10
because he died they are named in his
probate inventory and we have all their
names these are just a few of them Simon
Bob Fenton Ephraim William Washington
Phyllis manea and child Matilda and
George America and more 13 of these are
listed as children
so after he died his daughter&#39;s once the
younger daughter turned 18 which was
they filed a claim in the courts to get
the property divided up and
um which is really good for our research
tracked one this L-shaped tract right
is 46 acres and the jailhouse so it
actually names it in the deed and his
daughter Elizabeth who was married to
man named Brooks by that time
um and they built a house over here
and in track two 36 acres and the
mansion house
to Mary S Anderson and that one had the
dower right for the mother Susan s
Anderson so the house here in our field
sleeping right there
archeology the building was built before
1810 was domestic use early then after
the 1830 by 1832 becomes a slave jail
there&#39;s little archaeological evidence
for the slave jail itself
except that there is a gap in the
domestic artifacts and the flat glass
the sickness of flat glass
so lots of early artifacts late 1830s
1840s not so much from uh 1820s and 30s
so Anders Anderson bought it
1825 was a house first converted to a
slave pen the Schoenberger iron Mark
dates the changes to post 1832 so it was
actually a slave jail for only two years
between when he altered it and when he
died the Anderson mark on the second
floor which was on I believe this log
so we think that he probably raised
raised it up
so conclusions
Anderson was a prosperous man but a
risky business partner
he bought Acres build a brick house
converted to log building into a jail or
pen for enslaved persons it&#39;s a powerful
statement on slavery in the Ohio Valley
and it is not though
uh Underground Railroad Freedom Center
in Cincinnati and if you haven&#39;t been
there I encourage you to go
and visit it so
now we&#39;re going to transition to a much
more positive story
from a slave trader to a successful
Freedom Seeker and abolitionist and
we&#39;re going to talk about Henry Bibb for
the next Dean minutes or so
this is uh one of the two images that I
know of Henry Bibb and the people there
in the field are standing at the site
where the last place he was enslaved in
and this is the Gatewood Farm it&#39;s
outside of Bedford
in Trimble County
Kentucky and
myself along with Doug Boston my work
partner we have been Excavating there
with the Oldham County History Center
which is in LaGrange since 2005.
so have you been and I got a lot of
words in these next couple slacks so we
can run through Henry bibb&#39;s life he was
born about 1815 in Shelby County of
symbol was part of at that time
this is the other image of of Henry
also known as Walton
uh his mother was named Mildred Jackson
from age 15 to late 1820s he lived with
her on a a farm as enslaved people his
father could have been a man named James
Bibb that&#39;s who she said was his father
we don&#39;t really know a lot about who
that was their owner was David White
as a young child and a young man he was
loaned out to other people to do work uh
often mistreated he ran away multiple
1820s up to about 1833
um and and all this comes from Henry&#39;s
Photography
he was sold to a man named verus in
Newcastle Kentucky treated cruelly ran
away sold back to White
resumed his Escape attempts
1833 met a young woman also enslaved and
by a man named William Gatewood
um he met Melinda and they were allowed
to get married
um they had daughter Francis that he
names when she was born
he convinced William Gatewood to buy him
so that they would be on the same
property because his goal
was to get them out to escape
she would
run away and then he would
um get a job on a steamboat or on a flat
boat or on the docks or I think he made
all the way to Cincinnati on various
small towns in southern Indiana and I
get a little bit of money and then he
would come back
and invariably he got caught and he did
this multiple times
tried to get the family free
Gatewood had enough
um and sold all of them to Louisville
and then they were sold into
um Louisiana
and he tried to do the same thing down
there and then they were separated
she and
um job were sold and he never did find
them again
1842 he finally he made it to Detroit
excuse me and then over to Windsor
Canada probably by the that Center Route
coming up the west side of Indiana
because at that point he was coming from
Louisiana and Mississippi
foreign all the way to Canada
he learned to read and write became a
very well educated
um over that next 10 years
uh became an abolitionist joined the
Abolitionist Movement
kind of an early Frederick Douglass he
went around gave speeches helped to
raise money
became very well known especially in
uh met a young a free African-American
woman named Mary
when he realized he was never going to
find his
family again they were married and she
joined him in his abolitionist work
he published his autobiography in 1848
and in 1851 he published a newspaper
from Sandwich which is outside of
Windsor called the voice of The Fugitive
and this is uh volume one number one it
is an image with Henry Bibb listed as
the editor
he also became very involved with
Underground Railroad had contacts
throughout the network he arranged for
his mother Mildred to move from Kentucky
and live with them later on to his Seven
Brothers or somewhere else I saw three
um were able to escape and join bib in
Canada unfortunately he never did find
his Melinda or their daughter
he helped establish a group called The
refugees Home Society
by 1854 when he died they had purchased
2 000 acres of land and given a 25-acre
plots to 40 escaped uh slaves most near
Windsor Canada
he attended the lead conventions and
societies against slavery
October 1853 a fire destroyed his
printing office and he continued
publishing a newsletter
um August 1854 this is an obituary that
was published in Salem Ohio anti-slavery
Bugle on August 12th
uh this is where he&#39;s buried in Saint
John Anglican Cemetery in Windsor Canada
and um
so lots of interesting information in
this is a plaque in Canada about him
why my forward&#39;s not working here we go
the Gatewood Farm in Trumbull County was
the last place that they were enslaved
it&#39;s where Melinda had lived and worked
and where Henry did was uh right before
they were sold this is an image of the
House tickets blogs uh here it&#39;s been
covered with siding uh this is after the
rear Edition came off I&#39;ve got some
other pictures here
so here&#39;s Bedford Kentucky
oh this is us 42.
this right here
Ohio rivers up there
this is Route 421
and on this hill right outside of bed is
where the log house is located and this
was the gate farm that&#39;s the Gatewood
Cemetery right there the original road
to the house actually came off of a
street right here by the courthouse and
went down the creek and up to the house
here&#39;s just an image of
some of the volunteers Excavating at
it&#39;s another picture from early on so we
started working there in 2005.
um and you can see this is in grass
and there&#39;s the trailer which left after
a few years
we had them till all the way around the
and all these flags Mark the locations
of artifacts
and we gridded the whole thing out in
five by five meter squares which is
about 15 feet across
and you see people
um wandering around putting artifacts
where putting 10 Flags where they saw
and this shows the distribution of some
of the artifacts so here&#39;s the house
North is up
cut nails are the early kinds of nails
wire nails or later uh window glass
which is kind of everywhere
more 19th century pre-civil War Ceramics
and glass in in kind of different
locations out here
playing Ceramics everywhere
so we were interested in the combination
of the order nails
stoneware and the pre-civil war Ceramics
and glass and you kind of see a
a hole here like people are throwing
things out and about
so there were also excuse me a lot of
big rocks on the surface right in here
we started Excavating Edition
and we found a chimney base
right out beyond the addition and a
stone wall and it turned out this was a
in terms of a big basement or selling it
from later on but so before this Edition
went on there was a kitchen
that came down the addition went up
we worked in here for years digging uh
in this area and digging in the cellar
uh that was behind here and then the
addition came off
in the Fig Tree over here half of it
fell down
and it got too dangerous really close
so we went back to the map
and we&#39;re like okay well where&#39;s all
this other stuff and it&#39;s all across a
line across here
out behind the house
so we started digging out here and we
found the seller
we found a burned area which we think is
a fireplace or a hearth and we found
what&#39;s called a pit seller and these are
small holes here&#39;s just another picture
of people
screening dirt outside the building
there&#39;s a close-up of the uh
pet seller
and here&#39;s a profile of it we found a
blue glass bead which are
very positively associated with enslaved
occupations
a lot of personal artifacts a school
slate smoking pipes various buttons
from this time period and um
I don&#39;t want to go to the end just yet
so let me read so I got time
a couple minutes okay
so the pit seller and the accompanying
structure we did find evidence of a
structure on like a 1950 aerial in that
that analyzing
uh this artifact assemblage that we
collected also follows Trends found in
other slavery sites we have other beads
um earlier 19th century artifacts
um as well uh food remains things like
the importance of This research lies in
the fact that even though the area of
interest is small in size results in a
more detailed context and past lifeways
on the Gatewood Farm much of the
research has focused on Henry Viv and
the Gatewood family this work provides
more insights about lesser-known
enslaved community that was present
throughout the antebellum time period
hold on
some of the information that I&#39;m reading
comes from Doug bostro&#39;s Master&#39;s thesis
that he completed earlier on the side I
this investigation satisfies at least
three of Kentucky&#39;s Statewide objectives
uh in their state plan understanding
settlement patterns terming activity
areas and educating and involving public
participation
all this research gives the profound and
positive impact not just at the local
level but Nationwide
this began as the Henry gift Heritage
Trail stakeholder project and it is now
part of the National Underground
Railroad Network to to freedom and it&#39;s
one of only 14 uh listings in Kentucky
so this provides engaging experiences of
exploring and understanding past life
ways while highlighting the under
recognized enslaved population
to both local and National audiences so
think that&#39;s just about done I am
um and you can see the quiz answers
that are on the bottom of your screen
and if anyone&#39;s got any questions I
think I left some time
for questions and answers
yes well thank you so much Janine I know
Heather&#39;s been
um chatting in the chat I&#39;ve seen the
chats coming in so Heather what kind of
first of all did we have a winner for
one or both of the questions we did have
winners for both of the questions
um for the first question
um that was
what year did the bars on the slave pin
date two that was 1832 or after we had a
couple people put in the right answer
but the person who got it first was
Cindy and Woody Schuster so
congratulations
um you&#39;ll get here in the mail and then
the second question which was like what
city in Canada did Henry but moved to
that was Windsor
um that was Debbie Blackman got that
first we again had a couple correct
answers but she was first so
congratulations
um and could you put your mailing
address in the chat so that we can get
your prize to you
and then I guess from there
we will move on to questions
so the first one that we have is this is
when you were talking about John W
Anderson and they were wondering if the
farm is still there
the farm is still there
um obviously the building itself was
removed it&#39;s still private property
so yes
um and then they were also wondering if
you&#39;ve been able to excavate the
original House
no unfortunately not
we we got an artifact sample from the
small test bits that we done with the
um did not
want anyone Excavating outside of
immediately around the barn
so unfortunately no we did not
so the next question
is what is the average length of time
that an enslaved person would live in a
for Anderson it was probably up to maybe
six months it looked like he based on
the taxes that he had to pay so we&#39;ve
got some great tax records from Natchez
um and I think even New Orleans where
um he had to pay taxes after he sold
and it looked like he was going there
once or twice a year and several of
those years he went twice
so they would be taken to the farm and
held there probably up to about five
months or so because it would take
probably several weeks to get there once
they got on the flat boat
so not a long period of time there were
between 8 and 10 people who enslaved
people who lived there permanently
people who took care of the race horses
and I&#39;m sure someone who was doing the
cooking and
um you know hay and whatever Farm stuff
that had to be done
our next question
do you do with the found artifacts
they are at the Freedom Center
well now I take that back
most of them are at the University of
the artifacts that there are artifacts
at the Freedom Center that are on
outside the slave jail building
the rest of them are at the University
of Kentucky
standing and if so where
it is half collapsed
it&#39;s still in its original position
but all of the pictures that I didn&#39;t
want to show it looking really terrible
in the last two years it has half
collapsed there were a couple of storms
that did a lot of damage to it
and the big tree that half fell down the
other half fell down
so it&#39;s um it&#39;s in pretty bad condition
right now
and someone else was wondering if the
Bradford site is open to the public
Bradford&#39;s site
I don&#39;t know
if they can clarify that in the chat and
come back
and that was from Janus
I do have a Bradford side I&#39;m working on
but it&#39;s it&#39;s under a school building
now but
um I don&#39;t know
I mean where the slave pin came from is
private property
so no
and the Gatewood Farm is also private
property and we have permission to go
there when we do our digs but otherwise
it&#39;s not accessible
clarify that they were referring to the
gate website so that did it oh no it&#39;s
it&#39;s private property
um except when we do public digs through
the Oldham County History Center
and and we may actually have been there
the last time in July so
somebody did ask is the Bradford site in
Bradford Kentucky it&#39;s Bedford sorry
Bedford Kentucky
we may actually not be going back there
for now so
and then
the last question as of right now is was
the slave pen an original settlers Log
Moses Frazee
um they he was not the land grant holder
but he bought it in 1804.
so very early
and we believe he built it so
um I mean someone else was wondering who
funds to work on these projects like how
does the funding come in
on the slaves
um and this was before the Freedom
Center opened right so they opened in
2004 and we did the archeology before
that they got a grant from the Federal
Department of Education
that helped pay for all of the work and
moving it actually literally moving in
uh and putting it back up and and for
the exhibit so that was essentially a
grant from the federal government
um the work we do with the Oldham County
History Center at the Gatewood Farm in
the Henry Bibb project is mostly
sometimes we get expenses but that&#39;s uh
and that also comes through grants and
sponsorship so these are are not
like developer projects or you know
projects that are are paid because some
done because someone has to get a permit
they&#39;re mostly if there is money it&#39;s
through grants
currently that is the last question we
so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything else
you want to oh no what how does one go
about volunteering on these projects
um for the work that we do through the
Oldham County History Center watch
their website and they&#39;re in Lagrange
Kentucky and that&#39;s the Oldham County
History Center uh we&#39;re actually going
to be out next
whatever day that is that&#39;s October 8th
7th or 8th
um we&#39;re actually going to check out a
different site if any of you&#39;ve ever
heard of a woman named Delia Webster
if you haven&#39;t look her up she was an
abolitionist in Kentucky in the 1850s
and um Trent tended to get herself
arrested uh and put in jail for her
abolitionist activities and we have
identified her property
so um we&#39;re actually visiting that and
that is
um has volunteer opportunities but look
at the Oldham County History Center&#39;s
for public archeology
uh and that&#39;s how uh you get involved
with that
was as of now the last question we have
open Somebody went ahead and put that
link in there oh nice okay
anybody&#39;s interested the link is in the
chat there
I don&#39;t know if we
she said it looks like it would be fun
to volunteer I bet it would be
is that all Heather
yeah as of right now
all right well thank you so much Janine
