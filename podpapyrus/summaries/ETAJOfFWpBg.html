<li>Steve Vai joined David Lee Roth's band in 1986 for the "Eat 'Em and Smile" album and tour</li>
<li>Dave Roth originally planned to make a movie incorporating the band's music, with choreography by Tony Basil</li>
<li>The movie project was shelved by studios or production issues before completion</li>
<li>Steve Vai had an instinctive knowing that the David Lee Roth gig was meant for him</li>
<li>The band recorded "Kids in Action" (originally a Kim Mitchell song) but chose "Tobacco Road" for the final album instead</li>
<li>Vai accidentally transcribed and nearly recorded "Bangkok" from the musical Chess, thinking he had written it himself</li>
<li>Dave Roth served as Vai's final major mentor, teaching him stage presence, movement, and confidence</li>
<li>The band was sequestered in Roth's basement for months writing and rehearsing</li>
<li>Their stage show held the Guinness World Record for most light cans on stage</li>
<li>The tour featured massive crowds and intense fan reactions, starting in Huntsville, Alabama</li>
<li>Vai experienced culture shock hearing his own music on the radio and seeing fans' reactions</li>
<li>Ted Templeman produced the album with a relaxed approach that contrasted with Vai's usual perfectionist habits</li>
<li>The Lucky Strike reunion show was cancelled seconds before they were supposed to perform due to fire marshal concerns</li>
<li>All band members remain open to an "Eat 'Em and Smile" 30th anniversary reunion tour</li>
<li>Greg Bissonette credited Dave Roth with giving him his "platinum passport" to worldwide recognition</li>
<li>Vai's previous mentors included his high school music teacher, Joe Satriani, and Frank Zappa</li>
<li>The band had complete creative freedom on stage and wore extravagant 1980s costumes</li>

welcome back to the tapes archive
podcast where we release interviews that
have never been heard before in this
episode we have Frank Zappa&#39;s Little
Italian virtuoso and stunt guitar player
Steve Vai in this neverbe heard 2016
interview Vai talks with author Greg
renoff about the landmark David Le Roth

was the 30th anniversary of the iconic
album in the interview VI talks about
the song he thought he wrote but didn&#39;t

infamous Lucky Strike reunion show that
didn&#39;t happen the interview is conducted
by Greg renoff renoff is the author of
two Amazon best sellers and a mustre for
music fans Van Halen rising and Ted
templeman a platinum producer&#39;s life in
music if you haven&#39;t read these books do
yourself a favor and go get them now the
article that was a result of this
interview can be found on guitar world&#39;s
website I will link it in the
description I encourage all of you to go
read it a big thanks to Steve VI and
Greg renoff for allowing us to share
this interview with you thanks for
tuning in and now it&#39;s time to open the
vault is it okay if I record this yeah
please okay so I just had a few
questions I&#39;ve uh spent years as a fan I
saw you guys in uh 86 and &#39;87 on the
Edom tour yeah in New Jersey it was
great and uh so I read all the old
interviews and um so I uh wanted to come
uh upon this story in a way that I think
maybe some other people hadn&#39;t which is
to start with the the movie because I
think that&#39;s sort of the Lost thread of
the whole story there because if I
understand correctly when Dave called
you the first time at least the premise
of the call was that he was going to
make a movie which was going to happen
of course and then um you guys were
going to write songs for the movie well
you&#39;re close
Dave was putting together you know his
plan was to put together a kickass rock
band okay with exceptional players the
movie was something that him and Pete
Angelus were working on and we were
going to incorporate whatever music we
were writing for the record into the
movie and it got pretty deep you know at
one point we were actually looking at
scripts and and they were you know sort
of preparing the whole media campaign
with their um the videos that they did
as the Picasso Brothers and all that
stuff I was so young and just so
bewildered by everything and it was
everything was just interesting and
exciting and wild you know I mean uh I
was ready to do anything and we had a
lot of fun preparing for the movie we
actually got together with I think it
was Tony Basil was that the woman yeah
and started working out choreography for
the songs it was going to be really
great and then personally I never knew
what what happened I think there was
some some kind of a something between
Dave&#39;s production team and the movie
studios where they either put it on the
shelf or they right you know K killed it
I&#39;m not sure but next thing I knew it
wasn&#39;t on the table anymore what&#39;s your
sense on how the release would have been
different perhaps if it had been a
soundtrack I say that because I did some
digging through billboard and some other
things and Narada Michael Walden now
Rogers Eros Smith all these little
tidbits I see were they were saying they
were writing songs for Dave or Dave had
solicited songs from them do you have
any sense of how that all was going to
come together with you your original
songs no because I never heard that um
you&#39;re the first one telling me that it
was probably before I was in the picture
what you&#39;re saying sounds like maybe on
their mind was the idea of taking a
Hiatus from Van Halen and making this
movie in which case I know they were
they were reaching out to a bunch of
people I don&#39;t know who but then once I
showed up we just started writing music
and I never really it could have been
going on and I don&#39;t know nice to work
with those guys yeah the other thing I
always thought maybe they were just
thinking that you know like in a movie
you have to have obviously quite a bit
of music for if it&#39;s going to be a rock
Musical and maybe they were thinking
like n Rogers was going to do like he he
said like in the in the quote and
billboard like a big band jazz score so
maybe he was think they were thinking of
little little parts that were going to
be filled in by this music from other
other guys but yeah it&#39;s interesting to
hear you that sort of once you guys got
rolling it was sort of that was all
beside the point it would make sense to
me that some of the scenes might have
Incorporated big band stuff especially
since you know Dave had songs like mat&#39;s
life and just a jiggalo and Nile would
have been perfect for all that the other
thing of course is the uh the lost kids
in action song which it sounds like
again it was going to be the Kim
Mitchell was initially contacted by Dave
to supply music before you got into the
band by Billy Billy had basically put
Dave on to Kim and then you guys got
down to the fact we actually recorded
Kids In Action what do you remember
about that tune in the whole way that
song it turned out well when we had
gotten into the basement and started
jamming and riding and playing it was a
very open free creative environment in
that the thing that made most sense is
reach out to everybody before I got in
the band I know Dave was talking to some
other guitar players uh I think Kim
could have been one of them I know Steve
Stevens was one of them was already tied
up with the uh Billy Idol thing and
there was I think there was some others
I can&#39;t really really remember but the
odd thing for me is that I was just a
kid in an apartment and this the moment
I heard that David L Roth was looking
for a guitar player I just immediately
and instinct ly had a knowing that it
was my gig I don&#39;t know why you know
sometimes those things that&#39;s just like
this everything&#39;s connected and you know
so I didn&#39;t really pay much attention to
any of that other stuff but when I did
get into rehearsals there were a couple
of really good songs a whole bunch from
outside sources and I know one of them
was Kids In Action if we have a
recording of any of that stuff it was
just a basement cassette recording there
was no formal formal recording that I
remember yeah there&#39;s um I I&#39;ll send you
actually so I got in touch with Jeff
Hendrickson and it looks like when you
guys wanted to Fantasy you guys did cut
kids in actions from what Jeff has
sheets yeah I&#39;ll send it to you I&#39;ll
send you the sheet by email it&#39;s
interesting so what kind funny that I
don&#39;t even remember yeah I guess you&#39;re
talking to the wrong guy no you&#39;re
telling me this is great I mean this is
why I talked to all these people and so
Jeff Bova added keyboards at Power
Station at the very end and then what
Jeff remembers and what Ted told me was
that it kind of came down to Kids In
Action and Tobacco Road and for whatever
reason I don&#39;t know why Tobacco Road was
chosen over Kids In Action but it was it
was finished uh from what I&#39;m been able
to tell I&#39;ll send I&#39;d love to hear it
I&#39;d love to hear it because I don&#39;t
remember recording it but I&#39;m not very
good at stuff like that you know I mean
I write I write a lot of music back then
the habit for me was to write music on
tour like write it I would actually sit
and compose and then uh at the end of
the tour I just throw in a big pile
because I could never record it all and
then many years later I was working on a
record called fire garden and I was
going through all these papers all this
manuscript stacks of manuscript and I
found this one piece and it was in my
handwriting and I I really uh liked it
and I remembered writing it all and it
was a a beautiful piece and it was a
tossup between working on that piece or
another piece that I had written while
on tour so I decided to do this one and
um I recorded it was a big epic piece
it&#39;s like in four movements and and all
this stuff and the first movement right
before I handed the tapes into the label
I played it for a friend and he goes oh
I see you recorded Bangkok from uh uh
the the play chess and I said what are
you talking about this is I wrote this
song and he goes no that song was
written by Tim Rice and the guy from
ABBA and I&#39;m like well then they ripped
it off from me somehow you know and then
and he goes no Steve you gotta go and
listen to this go buy that record and
for [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sure man I uh I bought the
record and I listened to it and it was
it was exactly note for note the song
that I had written and then I realized I
called Dave something told me he was
involved with he gave and then I
remembered we were doing the in the
beginning of the even smile rehearsals
we were doing a putting the show
together and he gave me a cassette with
what he called a Hungarian Dance on it
or something and he said learn this and
show it to the band so like in between
set changes you guys can play it so I
trans he and what it was that he gave me
was Bangkok from chess and I described
the whole thing and just completely
forgot and threw it in my pile of music
so luckily I caught it in time and I was
able to give the right credit and get
permission that would have been a hard
thing to explain like it was you know
inadvertent I didn&#39;t know and it&#39;s like
it&#39;s note for note yeah that how dare
you stealing my music so as far I would
be really curious to hear Kids In Action
because frankly I just don&#39;t remember
recording um I keep pounding Jeff
Hendrickson the engineer to try to find
a tape he thinks he might have a tape
somewhere but yeah I&#39;ll send you the
track she you can see it just to Circle
back real quick does it make any sense
then to you that maybe Dave had
purchased songs from Aerosmith because I
I&#39;ll send you this in this little press
clipping that they say oh Dave told us
about these two scenes and we&#39;re gonna
write songs for the movie Joe again this
may again this may have all predated
before you get again but I&#39;m wondering
if any of that makes sense with the Kim
Mitchell Kids In Action like they&#39;ve had
a sort of a small collection of songs
that you guys could draw up on a pool if
that makes any sense or is that not
accurate you think well I know there was
a Dave had some songs from the past that
he really liked and I know Kids In
Action was one of them and he used to I
believe he used to refer to that song as
snake killer because it was um The Snare
was being hit so hard it looked like
somebody was trying to kill a snake uh
but there was other songs too and snake
killer could have been another song but
he had uh some songs but I don&#39;t recall
any of them being written by Aerosmith
okay with those guys so I don&#39;t I I
would have that would have been on my
radar for sure yeah interesting yeah
I&#39;ll send you the little clipping it&#39;s
it&#39;s again I&#39;m going to guess now that
I&#39;m talking to you that maybe that was
all you know Dave is done with Van Halen
doesn&#39;t have a guitar player needs to
get started on the movie what happens in
this business a lot of times is you
reach out to somebody with an idea and a
proposal and all systems look like
they&#39;re go so there&#39;s a tendency I do it
all the time even though it&#39;s not a good
practice is to leak it into the Press
because you&#39;re excited about doing it
yeah and you&#39;re talking people people
always say what are you doing these days
days and it&#39;s almost impossible to
resist saying I&#39;m writing something with
Dave Roth at the time there was a lot of
eyes on the band you know that might
have happened where they talked about it
but they never actually did it right
yeah that but why are you gonna are you
gonna interview Dave for all this well
days a little hard to reach um I wrote
this book um about the early days of Van
Halen Van Halen rising and I I would
hope that&#39;s a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] incredible
book great I mean honestly I&#39;m just so
flattered well it&#39;s the it&#39;s the best
as far as I I you know um My Hope was to
try to talk to Dave after I talked to
all you guys just say look but you know
he&#39;s a little bit challenging for the
average folk to reach you know and so um
he&#39;s just I know he&#39;s just come back
online he sort of had gone black over
the last year he like gone offline no no
social media nothing and so um I&#39;m gonna
try to get a message to him but uh we&#39;ll
see if that can yeah that would happen
that yeah I have a hard time getting a
hold of him too sometimes because
yeah he does his own thing I mean well
he&#39;s always busy and he&#39;s always being
productive and he doesn&#39;t waste time
you&#39;ll talk to him and he&#39;ll say yeah I
moved to New York for a year and I
became a class a medic paramet you know
and you&#39;re like of course you did
because that&#39;s what you do that&#39;s the
kind of thing that Dave would do he
would I have pictures of him that he
showed me tugging pulling in the he was
in the water in the Amazon pulling a
boat cuz they couldn&#39;t get the boat
through the weeds I can&#39;t I mean the
guy&#39;s intense man I can&#39;t tell you what
I learned from him so the the article is
going to conclude basically with the
with the Lucky Strike thing but it&#39;s
going to wrap up with the end of the uh
the first tour the one with Billy what
what&#39;s your your memories you&#39;re kind of
now you look back on that what&#39;s your
that you said you were young and it was
obviously your first huge huge Rock gig
what was your your experience with that
well um sometimes you don&#39;t realize
everything that&#39;s going on around you
when you&#39;re in it so when I first met
daavid was at his office and then the
the next time was in a in his basement
and we were sequestered in the basement
for many many months writing and playing
and writing and playing and Dave is a
master at press too and he had you know
we were sequestered I didn&#39;t know what
was going on in the outside world I mean
you got to remember I was just so young
but it was exciting the thing that was
so exciting to me was that the rawness
of the music the intensity of the of the
attitude of what we were going to try to
accomplish what we were aiming on
accomplishing having Billy as my brother
in that band and what we did together
and it was the perfect time it was like
the timing couldn&#39;t have been more
perfect all the elements came together
the trends at that time were as you know
in the 80s you could wear anything you
wanted and boy did we ever you know you
put on the biggest stage show I think uh
you know our the amount of Light cans
that we had on the stage is in the
Guinness book of world&#39;s record and we
played our ass off and Dave gave us
ultimate Freedom you know infinite
freedom on the stage basically to do
whatever we wanted and it was just
amazing to be on that tour when I got
out on that tour it the thing that when
it really all came home there was
several moments one was when the record
came out and I just started hearing it
on the radio I start hearing it the
matter of fact I was W the day after it
came out I was walking out of the gym
and I and I just walked into the parking
lot and I got in this guy&#39;s way and uh
kind of like a jock kind of a guy and he
and he rolls down his window and he&#39;s
screaming at me get the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out of the
way whatever he&#39;s saying and he&#39;s just J
you know as he&#39;s jamming to the music in
his car and he&#39;s listening to elephant
gun and I&#39;m like I&#39;m looking at him and
he&#39;s yelling at me and
he&#39;s hello yeah no yeah hold on one
second okay yeah hold on hello yeah hi
sorry that was Z
Wild Zach wild yeah we&#39;re doing a tour
together so oh yeah yeah cool yeah so I
was um I&#39;m just laughing get your ass
kicked to your own music it&#39;s like it&#39;s
a soundtra I know and the guy I&#39;m
looking at the guy and he&#39;s and he&#39;s
yelling at me with this you know freaked
out look on his face while he&#39;s while
his head is bobbing to my
guitar that was hilarious and then this
the second Awakening basically was the
first show when we arrived at the hotel
and the hotel was completely festooned
with fans and they had to create like
barriers to get in into the hotel and
then the party but being on the stage
that first night in Huntsville Alabama
it was a shock because you&#39;re now a rock
star performer and you got to deliver
and that there was 20,000 people and at
one point Dave does this thing where he
just stops and puts the mic out you know
and it went on for like 10 minutes and
the screaming was so loud that I was
it&#39;s if Billy and I were looking at each
other we were like scared it was louder
than our amps and I just thought what
happened this is wild and then the
parties and all were just just the best
they KN really knows how to throw a
party the whole tour was nothing but a a
really wild cool amazing ride that I am
so grateful I had an opportunity to be a
part of I tell you I got one more
question for you but I I&#39;ll tell you
what I talked to Greg Bonet you may have
been there when this happened I thought
this was such a cool little story he
told me he said that he gave gave a hug
at Lucky Strike and said Dave I love you
because you gave me my Platinum passport
it&#39;s good all over the world I go
anywhere I want and everyone you know
kind of knows me because of your ban I
thought that was like the coolest the
coolest thing you know well I mean I
could never when I when I do press and
people ask me who my mentors are my
first Mentor was my high school music
teacher because he taught me for seven
years every day how to write music and
then I took lessons from Joe sat for
three years and he was a powerful mentor
and then I had the great uh Fortune to
work for Frank Zappa for years and he
was an incredible Mentor but every one
of those people contributed vital things
in my learning experience as a
professional and an independent musician
and then Dave was my you know real final
major Mentor because what I learned from
him there was no way I could get from
anybody else when I joined that band I
was gawky I looked like a noodle I uh
you know I had no Charisma or stage
presence and he worked really hard with
me he he he took me to the gym five days
a week without fail worked with me on
stage on how to move and just watching
him move was you know was just powerful
and his confidence is fierce you it rubs
off well the yeah the audacity of
everything I mean even like the movie
like you&#39;re saying cly quite hit you but
I talked to Angelus about it too and you
know it&#39;s like this whole they wanted to
basically do in so many words like a
hard days night me kids are all right or
something like that you know like this
you supposed to Pete I did I did yeah
you know and that actually Pete told me
it was you know which I don&#39;t think he&#39;s
gone public about with that it was
initially supposed to be for Van Halen I
mean that was the original idea it was
that hey you know what we&#39;re on the top
of our uh our game right now it&#39;s late
1984 like to make a movie and those guys
passed on that so hence they went on
their own but you know the audacity of
that type thing and say yeah you know
but that&#39;s what have biggest star was
that Greg Bonet told me the night he
heard he was in the band for you know
that Dave told him he got the gig Dave
was on The Tonight Show with Joan
Rivers I remember that&#39;s what he heard
like over the top and I remember Pete
you know mentioning that uh they they
really wanted to do a a Van Halen movie
I don&#39;t know what happened with that
maybe the band wanted to not wanted to
Pete would know but then nothing&#39;s going
to stop Dave from doing what wants last
question for you which is what do you
see as a future for the Edom band well
you know I in all those bands that I was
in in the 80s and all the people I
worked for I felt like I was a dutiful
Soldier and that I contributed the best
I could authentically because I really
like that music but my heart was always
in well my heart was in both places but
there was also this brand of music that
was just unique to me that I felt the
need that I had to do that&#39;s not
uncommon and I did it you know I I&#39;ve
been releasing solo records that I love
for years and years and there was always
the feeling that it would be great to do
a a eat him and smile reunion tour I
mean I would love to honor that record
and that band because it was really a
unique band and uh Dave he&#39;s always been
you know very positive about that idea
you know obviously there&#39;s a lot of
moving parts and when we did the Lucky
Strike thing it was almost like you know
Rockstar interrupt us or something you
we were ready to play and we were all
psyched and we were just I mean people
say that minutes before we went on the
Fire Marshall came in but it was seconds
I was standing with the in front of in
back of the curtain just with the the
hot guitar in my hands and I was ready
to start we were psyched when when I
when I was told we couldn&#39;t play I did
everything I could to get us to play and
we just couldn&#39;t and I thought we have
to do something this is too much cool
energy to yeah you know yeah and you
know we had a little chat about it
afterwards and dve was just very very
receptive to anything that we would we&#39;d
want to do that would work out there&#39;s
like I said there&#39;s a lot of moving
parts I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m on tour until you
know mid
2017 and um you know Greg is always with
uh Ringo you everybody has things but we
definitely put it out there that this is
something we would like to do you know
would it be an album and a and that kind
of stuff I don&#39;t know I I wouldn&#39;t I
wouldn&#39;t want to get that deep into it
yet but the idea of a legacy honoring of
the Edom and smile album and band well
it&#39;s it&#39;s 30th anniversary and also I
think would be really nice you know
there&#39;s no big commitment there&#39;s no
desire to be big rock stars or have a
super group or sell millions of Records
is it would be about getting out there
and just bringing it home and you know
the way we used to do it yeah we still
have the juice we do it would be amazing
I mean I tell you everyone I&#39;ve talked
to even when I talked to I talk to Ted&#39;s
uh templeman not infrequently and you
know he even says like oh I&#39;d love you
know I&#39;d love to do that again it was
just so great you know how great you
guys were and just how blown away he was
and you arranged all the music for I&#39;m
easy and then Greg Bonet called in all
the session guys for on eing he just had
a a blast making the record too so it
seems to be was a blast working with him
too gosh he such a wonderful approach it
was a it was a blessed relief to the way
that I usually work yeah I I don&#39;t want
to keep you because I know you have
other stuff to do but I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;ve
gotten a big kicked out of reading your
old interviews I Now understand how Ted
works and reading how you were you know
you you wanted to punch in a million
times and Ted be like no you did it like
what are you talking about it was one
it&#39;s not I remember we were doing like
yeah we were doing elephant gun and I
said well I want to double the part he
goes what do you mean you know double it
because it&#39;s all over the place and I go
well I can double every single little
thing perfectly and he said well he I
actually felt like he didn&#39;t want to
take the time and I said let me just let
me just try it so I started doing it in
the middle of the double I broke a
string and Ted said well you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s said probably just leave it
with the one guitar you know then he
left the studio and I finished it and
then when he heard it he liked it so
that&#39;s made yeah yeah yeah Ted always
told me he wore two hats he was the VP
of the you know by that point he was a
record company VP I&#39;m sure he was
thinking like budget I don&#39;t know that
but Mike just you know I wonder if he&#39;s
like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] we&#39;re spending so much money
here it&#39;s done it&#39;s good let&#39;s go you
know so Steve listen it was a real
thrill to talk to you and thank you so
much for taking the time and uh do you
need anything let me know because I
really like the way you write you know
there&#39;s an equilibrium there and you do
your research really well and you&#39;re
concerned about facts and anybody that
you&#39;re going to write a book about I
think is fortunate because uh it&#39;s a
good document for their cache so
anything I you I can do for you let me
