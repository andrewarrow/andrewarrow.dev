Last week, UNbacked experts with the
IPC, or Integrated Food Security
Classification System, officially
declared Gaza City in a state of
man-made famine. Only the fourth such
declaration made in that organization&#39;s
history. Here you can see the steady
rise in those facing emergency levels of
food insecurity and catastrophic levels
of food insecurity. Already Gaza City
has reached that organization&#39;s metrics
for an official famine declaration with
35% of households at that catastrophic
mark and another 55% at the emergency
level. The other regions of the Gaza
Strip are also on track for famine if a
ceasefire and surge in aid is not
immediately achieved with conditions
worsening everywhere. The authors of the
report sounded a dire warning, saying,
quote, &#34;If a ceasefire is not
implemented to allow humanitarian aid to
reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if
essential food supplies, and basic
health, nutrition, and sanitation, and
water services are not restored
immediately, avoidable deaths will
increase exponentially.&#34; Now, will
Israel use this official report to take
a step back, reflect on how they could
have lost their way so badly as to go
from genocide victims to genocide
perpetrators in just a few generations,
or even just to consider with shame the
way that they have torched their
reputation as a civilized nation with
the entire rest of the world? Obviously
not. Instead, they waged an immediate
allout war to try to deny the veracity
of this assessment. Pseudocience
propaganda reports were crafted.
Netanyahu, of course, called it a blood
liel. An official Israeli Hazbara
influencers were dispatched to debunk
the claims. But the real high IQ
genocide denial take came directly from
the Israel Twitter account. Here, they
claimed that the IPC lowered their
standard to 15% malnutrition in order to
unjustly smear Israel. Quote, &#34;In other
countries, the IPC declares famine at
30% malnutrition. In Gaza only, the
UNbacked IPC lowered the bar to 15% and
it is based on unreliable data. They
didn&#39;t find famine, so they forged one.
This, of course, is total and complete
a madeup lie to deflect and to
confuse you. Refugees International
President Jeremy Conandike posted an
excellent thread to explain the trick
that Israel is trying to pull here. He
points out that first of all the exact
same metric was used for declaring
famine in Sudan just last year. So right
out of the gate this whole blood liel
anti-semitism double standard claim from
Israel is completely blown up. The TLDDR
is this. There are two different
assessments which can be used to
determine famine conditions. Both of
which have been used by the IPC in the
past. One is weight for height which is
basically a BMI metric and the other is
MUAC or midupper arm circumference.
Kandike writes that both are valid ways
of assessing global acute malnutrition
in a population and in line with IPC
guidance. Midupper arm circumference is
often used when assessors have limited
access as is the case in Gaza due to
Israel&#39;s decimation of the healthcare
system and attacks on international aid
workers. These two different metrics
also have two different thresholds for
famine designation. Here so you know is
the relevant chart. You can see that for
the BMI weight for height metric 30% of
children must be boundished for it to be
deemed a famine. For the mid-upper arm
circumference test the threshold for
phase 5 famine is 15% of children which
is what was met in Gaza City. As to why
the different tests merit different
thresholds. Kandike writes the following
quote. Because they measure different
physical characteristics, weight for
height and MUAC often manifest at
different levels within the same
population. A lower MUAC usually equates
to a higher weight for height gam.
That&#39;s a famine measurement. Hence the
different thresholds of 15% and 30%. So
essentially mid-upper arm circumference
is a more stringent criteria. So, if
you&#39;re seeing 15% in trouble using that
criteria, you would likely have measured
more than 30% if you were able to do a
full weight for height assessment. The
Israelis are not stupid. They know all
of this. They&#39;re just hoping you are
stupid and that you won&#39;t look past
their surface level assertions and that
the process is rigged or to be so
terrified about being accused of
anti-semitism that you will back down at
the first challenge. There are other
high acute genocide denial claims
though, and they are similarly
dishonest. Israel claims that Gaza City
did not yet actually cross even that 15%
assessed child malnutrition threshold as
required in July. In fact, the report
breaks July into two halves. In the
second half of July, the threshold was
in fact breached, clearly demonstrating
the trend is towards worsening
conditions and that the most recent data
is in fact indicative of phase 5 famine.
Israel also claims that Gaza has not met
the threshold for famine based on the
number of deaths from starvation. here
too. They are lying and they are
gaslighting you. The IPC standards take
into account all famine related deaths,
not solely those in which the sole cause
is starvation. As Near Hassan writes for
Harets, quote, &#34;Mass hunger is not only
a medical issue caused by food shortage.
It is a total collapse of the systems
that sustain life. Elderly people and
infants die because their immune systems
are weakened. They suffer infections
from living in tents without sewage or
clean water. Chronically ill patients
die because they cannot access treatment
or special food or are too weak to
travel to clinics. Premature births and
pregnancy complications are rising. And
this is only a partial list. In other
words, ignoring those deaths in which
starvation was a contributing factor is
the equivalent of claiming that there
was no Holocaust because actually Anne
Frank died of typhus. But this is far
from the only area where Israeli
propagandists echo the despicable claims
of Nazis and Holocaust deniers. The
Israeli government has been busy pushing
their influencer cutouts to back up all
of their genocide denial. According to
Haratz, the Israeli Diaspora Affairs
Ministry sponsored influencers to take
PR trips to the GHF aid massacre sites
where they of course dutifully reported
back that all was well and no one was
starving. Propagandists like Al Yakabe
have been busily reposting videos
purporting to show Gaza grocery stores
chalk full of food and Palestinians out
there enjoying lavish spreads of food.
You should be very skeptical of all of
these photos and videos. There have been
a bunch of instances where they were
actually old videos or for somewhere
else entirely. But even when they are
actually from Gaza in the present day,
they prove nothing. And as Zed Galani
writes, they come straight out of the
playbook of Holocaust denial. Drawing
the parallel, Zed writes of the way a
few restaurants in the Warso ghetto were
used to claim that Jews were not only
just fine, but they were actually
gluttonous. Quote, &#34;The Nazis didn&#39;t
have access to social media, but they
did have cameras. They used these
restaurants in the ghetto to portray an
image of Jews getting fat off of
plentiful food, ignoring the mass hunger
and violence that gripped ordinary life
in the ghetto.&#34; The following is the
recollection from Samuel Pterman who was
there. The guests were supposed to eat a
lot voraciously and wash down the food
with alcohol. He said they were filming
waiters bustling around the tables laden
with trays on which gourmet delicacies
were piled up. They photographed the
general view of the crowded room, single
ladies who were ordered to lift up their
dresses high. Jews eating sardines from
the can with their fingers. Jews playing
under the table with the bare calves of
the female companions of the libation.
Jews throwing halfeaten goose quarters
under the table. The film reel did not
show fainting women and the black and
blue faces of people hit with a whip.
Yakabe and his ilk are pulling the same
detestable trick, showing a few
decadentl looking scenes and claiming
this is remotely representative, daring
you to disbelieve the doctors, the
experts, Palestinians themselves, and
what you can see with your own eyes on
your own timeline every single day.
Herets did a virtual tour recently of
Gaza hospitals and they found exactly
the horrific conditions you would expect
among a trapped, starved, bombed
population, child after child with bones
jutting out, abdomen distended, full
body rashes from the diarrhea caused by
malnutrition and poor sanitation.
There&#39;s little Amar, an infant whose
hair was faded to a reddish brown, whose
mom was too starved to breastfeed and
too poor to purchase the $100 per tin
formula. So, she fed him all that she
had, corn starch in water. Doctors say
if he survives, his brain will be
permanently damaged and he will suffer
lifelong severe retardation. There&#39;s
Sham, a tiny 2-year-old weighing less
than 10 lb. She was a healthy child just
before October 7th. Now her body is
wasted. Her face is that of an old man.
Her family too could find no milk
substitute for her. The doctor caring
for Sham said, quote, &#34;As you can see,
she&#39;s in a miserable situation. She&#39;s
always crying. She&#39;s always suffering.
Tell me they aren&#39;t real. You sick
freaks. You disgusting monsters. Tell me
I&#39;m an anti-semite for believing that
their lives matter, too. Your lies, your
gaslighting, your number games are so
paper thin, I can&#39;t imagine you even
find them convincing yourselves. I hope
that these babies whose lives you&#39;ve
stolen haunt you for the rest of your
days. You are utterly disgusting and a
disgrace to humanity. Sager, I have lost
words to describe how despicable I find
this game that they&#39;re playing. I hate
that I had to spend
