            <div class="text-blue-50 whitespace-pre-wrap">**CCP&#39;s Taiwan Takeover Plan Summary:**

Chinese professor Yang Hunging reveals Wang Huning (Xi Jinping&#39;s strategist) issued four orders in November 2024:

1. **Rage over TPP leader Ko&#39;s corruption investigation** - Beijing lost a key political asset
2. **Demand more violent legislative chaos** - May 2024 parliament clashes weren&#39;t destructive enough  
3. **&#34;We don&#39;t need to consider Taiwan&#39;s 2028 elections&#34;** - Implying 2024 was the last
4. **Activate all CCP agents immediately** - Politicians, scholars, influencers told to spread division

**Three-Step Takeover Strategy:**
1. **Create controlled chaos** - Use legislative battles and media to destroy social trust
2. **Paralyze Taiwan&#39;s defenses** - Military can&#39;t act domestically; police overwhelmed
3. **Parliamentary invitation** - Pro-Beijing legislature formally &#34;invites&#34; mainland security forces

**Current Progress (Four Strikes):**
- **Legislature**: &#34;Parliamentary reforms&#34; grant unlimited investigative powers, can force presidential testimony
- **Defense**: Budget cuts weakening military readiness and morale
- **Oversight**: Control Yuan (Taiwan&#39;s watchdog) being abolished, powers transferred to legislature  
- **Finance**: Legislature bypassing executive to distribute cash directly to public

**Successful Examples:**
- **South Korea**: Pro-Beijing President Lee replaced impeached Yoon, now shields Chinese interests
- **Hong Kong**: Same playbook turned free city into &#34;cage&#34; without tanks

**Key Point**: Beijing hijacks democracy rather than destroying it, turning democratic institutions against themselves.

          <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
            <div class="text-green-50 whitespace-pre-wrap">Based on the text, here are the 18 most important points:

1. **Xi Jinping&#39;s November 2024 Orders**: Four specific directives given through Wang Huning to Taiwan Affairs Agency for subverting Taiwan

2. **No 2028 Elections Expected**: CCP doesn&#39;t anticipate Taiwan will hold elections in 2028, suggesting 2024 may have been the last

3. **Three-Step Takeover Plan**: Create controlled chaos → paralyze immune system → parliamentary invitation for PLA intervention

4. **Parliamentary Reform Weapon**: Grants legislature power to charge officials with contempt, unlimited investigations, and force presidential appearances

5. **Defense Budget Sabotage**: Opposition systematically cutting Taiwan&#39;s air defense, radar, and missile budgets

6. **Control Yuan Neutralization**: Constitutional watchdog being abolished with powers transferred to legislature

7. **Financial Control Takeover**: Legislature bypassing executive to directly distribute cash, controlling Taiwan&#39;s budget

8. **Ko Wenju&#39;s Downfall**: Beijing&#39;s backup plan (TPP leader) accused of corruption, seen as major loss to United Front efforts

9. **Legislative Violence Insufficient**: May 28, 2024 parliament clashes deemed &#34;not enough&#34; - Beijing wants more damaging violence

10. **All CCP Agents Activated**: Politicians, scholars, influencers, clergy told to prove loyalty through polarization and division

11. **Social Trust Destruction**: Goal to make people distrust news, government, police, friends, and family

12. **False Choice Creation**: Democracy vs stability, clean governance vs public order dilemmas

13. **Military Paralysis Strategy**: Military can&#39;t act domestically without being labeled dictatorial; police overwhelmed and afraid

14. **&#34;Security Personnel&#34; Disguise**: PLA will enter Taiwan wearing security uniforms, not military gear

15. **South Korea Case Study**: President Yoon impeached after martial law declaration; pro-Beijing Lee Jae-myung now leads

16. **Hong Kong Precedent**: Successful takeover using politicians, media, and activists without tanks

17. **Parliamentary Invitation Script**: Formal resolution will invite &#34;mainland security personnel&#34; to restore stability

18. **Democracy Hijacking Method**: Using democratic processes and institutions to destroy democracy from within

According to Professor Yang Hunging, a
Chinese dissident living in Australia,
in a closed door meeting in November
2024, Xiinping issued his instructions
and his instructions were interpreted
and carried out or put into action by
his chief strategist, his ideological
architect, Wang Huning, the most
dangerous man in the world. He
translated Xiinping&#39;s words into action
and gave four orders for the Taiwan
Affairs Agency on uh in November 2024.
So his order number one is he um raged
over Taiwanese government&#39;s
investigation into Kenju, leader of the
Taiwan People&#39;s Party, TPP. Co is
accused for corruption while being the
mayor of Taipei. He had been Beijing&#39;s
backup plan. uh the anti-China looking
puppet they could use if power shifted.
One Huning called Co&#39;s downfall a huge
loss to Beijing&#39;s United Front efforts.
And his order number two is uh one
pointed to the violent clash inside
Taiwan&#39;s legislature on May 28th, 2024
when opposition lawmakers pushed through
sweeping reforms that expanded
Parliament&#39;s power. Chaos erupted, but
one said it wasn&#39;t enough. He demanded
something bigger, more damaging, more
violent, something that would scar
Taiwan&#39;s political order, shall we say.
And his order number three is the most I
think it&#39;s the most terrifying. Um, and
he said, &#34;We don&#39;t need to consider
Taiwan&#39;s elections in 2028.&#34;
So, in other words, CCP doesn&#39;t
anticipate a 2028 elections in Taiwan.
Does this mean that in their plan, 2024
election was the last one? Well, think
about it. Juan made the statement just
nine months ago and now we&#39;re less than
three years from 2028. And his order
number four is um clear. His instruction
is clear. Act now. Normal waiting. All
CCP agents inside Taiwan, politicians,
scholars, influencers, even clergy were
told to work hard to prove their
loyalty. Um, they should push CCP
talking points, push CCP narratives,
polarize society, burn bridges, spread
division, you name it. So, these four
orders are classic CCP subversive
maneuvers. They strike directly at
Taiwan&#39;s vital democratic organs. Let me
first break down CCP&#39;s playbook step by
step. Step one is create controlled
chaos. Push through controversial laws
in the legislature. Stoke public
outrage. Use media and social media to
fan both sides. The blue camp versus the
green camp in Taiwan. And then flood the
streets with angry crowds. CCP&#39;s goal
isn&#39;t protest. The goal is to cause a
collapse of social trust. Beijing wants
to create an environment in which people
stop believing the news or government
officials. They stop trusting the
police. Social media will be effective
to instill distrust. So this distrust in
CCP&#39;s plan will spread to everyday life.
People eventually will start suspecting
their friends and family and everyone
around them. And so it will let this
public anxiety ferment so that society
is eventually torn between two carefully
crafted false choices. It&#39;s democracy
versus stability. Clean governance
versus public order. When the chaos
reaches a boiling point, CCP spies will
repeat history by staging a Shi incident
type of coup in which a peaceloving
general will take the Taiwanese
president hostage, forcing him to stop
the chaos by asking Beijing to step in.
And just like that, Beijing&#39;s plan is
halfway complete. Step number two,
paralyze Taiwan&#39;s immune system. So you
may say, why can&#39;t the Taiwanese
president use the military to restore
order? No. Taiwan&#39;s military can only
defend against foreign threats. If the
president tries to deploy the military
to quell domestic unrest, CCP controlled
media and politicians will immediately
hold press conferences accusing him of
abuse of power, being a dictator, and
being oppressive. CCP&#39;s friends in
Western media will also amplify this
narrative. Headlines will scream,
&#34;President of Taiwan cracks down on his
own protesters.&#34; At that moment,
Taiwan&#39;s military leader will face an
impossible choice. Obey the chief
commander and become war criminals or
refuse and be um perceived as
treasonous. So, they will be forced to
to choose inaction. What about the
police? Well, first of all, there aren&#39;t
enough of them. Secondly, they&#39;re under
pressure from agitated public and
self-righteous politicians and media,
and so they&#39;re afraid to act. So, when
the military and law enforcement become
politically paralyzed, Taiwan&#39;s entire
security system has imploded. And that
leads to step number three. The final
blow comes when the parliament issues uh
a formal resolution on a piece of paper.
So this resolution will be passed by the
parliament that is controlled by a
probeijing majority. So they will hold
an emergency session then read a
carefully crafted statement something
like to prevent a total breakdown of a
social order in Taiwan and any possible
humanitarian crisis. This legislature
under the authority of blah blah blah
formally invite the mainland to send
security personnel to assist in
restoring stability. Notice the wording.
There&#39;s no mentioning of the PLA, no
mentioning of unification, no
declaration of surrender. But once that
invitation is passed, the People&#39;s
Liberation Army will dress up as
volunteer security personnels and land
in Taiwan. Just like Victor Gao
described, they will enter the island
wearing security uniforms. And Beijing
will announce to the world, we respect
the decision and are responding to the
lawful request from Taiwan&#39;s lawmakers.
And Taiwan&#39;s legislature will issue
another decree preventing Taiwanese
military police or the public from
resisting the mail and security forces
or they will be reprimanded. So the
whole world would be stunned if when
this happened and just like that
Taiwan&#39;s democracy will be buried alive
in the name of a democratic process. No
blood, no tanks or fighter jets. It uses
Taiwan&#39;s all powerful parliament and
probeijing politicians as well as
probeijing media and the entire CCP
undercover network to make this happen.
It doesn&#39;t destroy democracy but hijacks
it. It turns democracy against itself.
And here&#39;s the most chilling part. It&#39;s
already happening in Taiwan. Step by
step, Beijing&#39;s internal takeover plan
is unfolding slowly. So now, let me talk
about the progress they&#39;ve made in
Taiwan. There are four strikes. The
first strike is in the legislature. So
CCP&#39;s sharpest weapon is hidden behind
something that&#39;s called parliamentary
reform. It sounds totally harmless, but
it&#39;s deadly. On paper, it promises
efficiency and oversight. In practice,
it has become a sledgehammer in the
hands of Beijing&#39;s proxies inside the
parliament. This so-called reform grants
the KMT controlled legislature three
extraordinary powers. The first one is
contempt of Congress law. So if an
official answers, gives vague answers or
refuses to answer
um at these hearings uh or displays the
wrong attitude or simply refuses, right?
Lawmakers can charge him or her with
contempt and haul him to court. And the
second is unlimited investigative powers
and there&#39;s no limits, no safeguards.
ministers, generals, intelligence
chiefs, even private citizens or
business owners are fair game. If they
don&#39;t like you, they can investigate
you. They can put you under
investigation. And the third is um they
can force the president to appear for
questioning. Um so this reform crosses a
constitutional red line. It flips the
balance of power upside down, placing
the legislature above the presidency and
crushing the authority of the executive
branch. So now this almighty legislature
can paralyze the government, silence the
president and hollow out Taiwan&#39;s
administration from within. And that&#39;s
not it. Okay, that&#39;s first strike. And
the second strike is slash defense.
While the mainland&#39;s threats grow daily,
what is Taiwan&#39;s legislature doing?
cutting defense budgets to the bone. Air
defense, nothing. Radar gone, missiles
slashed. And this isn&#39;t fiscal prudence,
it&#39;s sabotage. It&#39;s cutting Taiwan&#39;s
nerves before the enemy even strikes.
And this has terrible consequences
because in the Taiwanese military,
budget cuts caused pessimistic
sentiment. officers and soldiers are
openly whispering, &#34;We can&#39;t defend
Taiwan because politics has tied our
hands.&#34; And this certainly puts a smile
on the CCP leader. The third strike is
has to do with check and balance, right?
So, you may ask, what about the um the
organization called the Control UN? It&#39;s
Taiwan&#39;s constitutional watchdog tasked
with auditing, investigating corruption,
and impeaching officials. It has been
dysfunctional or neutered, shall we say.
So through interference, pressure
campaigns, and endless stalling, this
body has been left running on fumes. And
in June this year, two reps, one from
the People&#39;s Party and one from the KMT,
they introduced an amendment to abolish
this organization outright. And they
want to shift its powers to the
legislature itself. And this measure now
has enough support to advance. So that
means only one thing. The legislature
investigates everyone but no one
investigates the legislature and it is
its own watchdog now. Checks and
balances dead. And the last strike is it
targets Taiwan&#39;s financial lifeline. So
the KMT lawmakers um the opposition
party now propose that the legislature
itself bypassing the executive branch,
bypassing the cabinet should hand out
cash directly to the public. And this
tactic is reportedly one of the reasons
the KMT survived the first wave of the
recalls by simply promising the public
cash. Again, this is legislature
overtaking fiscal responsibility of the
executive branch. If this passes,
Taiwan&#39;s budget won&#39;t be managed by
professionals. It will become a
political ATM controlled by whichever
party dominates parliament. Today, it&#39;s
vote buying handouts. Tomorrow, it could
be used to give welcome packages to the
PLA. So the above four strikes give you
a clear picture of CCP&#39;s intention in
Taiwan. When the budget is
misappropriated, when the military is
demoralized, when the president&#39;s hands
are tied, and when oversight is dead,
Taiwan will no longer be a functioning
democracy. It will be a hollow shell
ready for the final takeover. I&#39;m not
saying that Taiwan has become a
non-functioning democracy, but it&#39;s
heading in that direction if people
don&#39;t stop it. I want to bring up two
successful cases in which the CCP used
the same playbook. One is South Korea
and the other is Hong Kong. I think the
rest, not just the Taiwanese, I think
the rest of the world should study these
two cases carefully. So, let&#39;s take a
look at South Korea first. In my
opinion, it&#39;s already walking the path
Beijing designed. So pro- US President
Yunsuk Yo tried to stand firm against
Beijing&#39;s encroachment, but the pro-CP
opposition in parliament strangled his
government at every turn. Yun sounded
the alarm, warning of communist
interference in national security. His
answer, declare martial law to save his
administration. The result, he was
impeached, detained, briefly released,
and then dragged back into custody. His
supporters openly blamed China and North
Korea for orchestrating his downfall.
And who placed replaced him? A probe
Beijing candidate, Li Jay Ming. Li J
Mong. He won the presidency in a special
election. The nation is split down the
middle, but Beijing has what it wanted,
its maning soul. So on July 22nd, a
conservative civic group protested
outside the Chinese embassy in Seoul. So
they tore apart a Chinese flag printed
with Xiinping&#39;s face and shouted CCP
out. The response, instead of defending
free speech, their president, President
Lee, condemned the protest as a hate
rally. He ordered a crackdown on his own
citizens. words and actions that drew
praise straight from Beijing. China&#39;s
mouthpiece, the Global Times, celebrated
the moment. It quoted experts who called
it a positive signal that Lee&#39;s
government was aligning itself with
Beijing. Reports even suggested China&#39;s
ambassador to South Korea um Shing
Haiing had pressed Soul to take action
against the demonstrators and President
Lee delivered. And uh former President
Yun&#39;s wife uh the former first lady is
now behind bars. For the first time in
history, a South Korean presidential
couple sits in detention, accused of
corruption and evidence tampering. So
the symbolism couldn&#39;t be sharper.
Beijing&#39;s rivals are erased, humiliated,
and neutralized. The result, a once free
ally of the US now has a president who
shields Beijing&#39;s interests. South Korea
in some ways has already gone further
than Taiwan in China&#39;s political
takeover plan. The second case I want to
give you is Hong Kong. It&#39;s the same
playbook, different city. Beijing
planted politicians, co-opted the media,
and mobilized loyal grassroots
activists. They were never the majority
in Hong Kong, but they didn&#39;t need to
be. Step by step, they turned one of the
freest, most prosperous cities on Earth
into a cage. Journalists are jailed,
youth beaten, locked up, or forced into
exile. Even CCP party elders like Wing
Jabal admitted their shock at how
quickly Xiinping managed to pacify,
quote unquote, pacify Hong Kong. Even
the party elders had expected the city&#39;s
freespirited people to put up a long
fight before throwing the towel. So the
lesson is clear. Beijing doesn&#39;t need
doesn&#39;t need tanks to conquer. It uses
parliaments, media, social platforms,
and some elites and politicians as well
as grassroot activists as weapons. and
it&#39;s already winning battles first in
Hong Kong and maybe now in Seoul. So
that&#39;s why I remain deeply concerned for
Taiwan&#39;s safety and democracy. So please
don&#39;t take it for granted and don&#39;t be
complacent.
