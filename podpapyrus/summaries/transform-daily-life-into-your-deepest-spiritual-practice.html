<li>You are not in control of life - the universe operates independently with or without your involvement</li>
<li>Meditation alone isn't enough - you must work on what pulls you back down to ordinary consciousness</li>
<li>The personal mind is a collection of stored past experiences that you didn't want to let go</li>
<li>Your consciousness is meant to experience moments, not cling to and store them</li>
<li>Everything meaningful in your life (heartbeat, breathing, cellular functions) happens automatically without your control</li>
<li>The ego is a tiny subset of the universal mind focused only on personal preferences and fears</li>
<li>You create your own suffering by holding onto experiences you didn't like instead of letting them pass through</li>
<li>The path is to stop storing new disturbances in your mind - practice letting go of daily irritations</li>
<li>Relaxation, not resistance, is the key to allowing experiences to pass through you</li>
<li>Your consciousness is actually God consciousness experiencing creation through your unique perspective</li>
<li>Most of what you think is happening (especially others' thoughts about you) is projection from your stored fears</li>
<li>Working with yourself gently and apologetically is more effective than fighting your mind</li>
<li>The spiritual path involves looking down at your mental patterns rather than trying to transcend upward</li>
<li>When you stop adding new psychic material, old stored pain will naturally surface for release</li>

Jagr masters sometimes people write and
they ask
why don&#39;t you teach meditation what&#39;s
the purpose of meditation what am I
supposed to be experiencing in
meditation
I stopped teaching meditation a very
very a long time ago. Not that I don&#39;t
meditate, but I realized
no matter how you meditate or how deep
you go, you&#39;re coming back
to have you noticed. At some point in my
journey, the longing was so strong that
it was unbearable to come back. So, you
try to meditate longer, but you&#39;re
coming back. I don&#39;t care what technique
you use.
I don&#39;t care how long you sit.
you&#39;re coming back
and so I didn&#39;t want to come back
but tapasia and meditating six hours a
day and strict it still came back so my
path became
why am I coming back not why can&#39;t I
meditate or why should I meditate longer
or what am I doing wrong and you start
instead Instead of up,
you start by looking down.
What is holding me down? What is pulling
me back? It&#39;s so beautiful when you
manage to go into a deep state or have a
deep spiritual experience. Why do you
come back?
Because there&#39;s something pulling you
back. It doesn&#39;t even take a moment. One
phone call, a thought, anything,
somebody talking, and next thing you
know, that meditative state is over.
Well, I didn&#39;t want it to be over. So
the path that I ended up following for
all these years and the one I teach, I
don&#39;t teach not to meditate. I teach
what to do when you&#39;re not meditating
because that&#39;s the majority of your time
to say the least. And when you look down
instead of up, you know, you have to
stretch to look up. You have to struggle
to look up. Why? What is going on down?
that is so weird that it keeps pulling
you into it. So instead of trying to
fight to stay up or go up,
you start looking to see what is this
that is pulling you down. And at first
it looks like it&#39;s the world. There&#39;s
people, there&#39;s relationships, there&#39;s
finances, there&#39;s this, there&#39;s that,
there&#39;s noise, there&#39;s different things
in the world that disturb you and they
pull you down. Well, you start looking
at that. At some point, you realize, I
can&#39;t control the world. In my case, I
moved out here to be in the middle of
nowhere alone and nothing was out here
in those days. Nothing. There wasn&#39;t
paved roads or anything. And I&#39;d be
meditating and a dog would be barking,
but the dog wasn&#39;t next door, you know,
miles away. And I realized I can&#39;t stop
that. What can I do? How can I stop the
world from bothering me? And you realize
you can&#39;t. Why? Because the world plays
its own song. The dog barks when it
barks. and the police car goes by when
it goes by and the road makes noise and
then people come visit and then this
happens and it rains when you&#39;re outside
and then there&#39;s just things that
happen. Have you noticed? It&#39;s a
happening place. And it took me a while,
but I&#39;m pretty smart guy. I realize I
can&#39;t control that.
I can&#39;t control the dog barking. I can&#39;t
control the weather. I can&#39;t control who
comes out to visit. I can&#39;t control
whether people&#39;s in a good mood or bad
mood. I can&#39;t control what&#39;s unfolding
causing these disturbances that I&#39;m
blaming on what&#39;s happening outside. And
so you take your next step, which is
why is it bothering me? Not does it
bother me? If you don&#39;t behave the way I
expect you to, you bother me. Is it true
that you bother me or do I bother me?
That was the next major step because I
can&#39;t control you and everybody else and
all the different situations that
unfold. I don&#39;t care what you do. Move
out to the middle of nowhere. It don&#39;t
matter. They&#39;ll start building there.
Things are going to happen and you&#39;re
not in control. That&#39;s one of the
biggest things you find out you are not
in control. You are not in control. Have
you noticed? And if you try to be in
control one, you won&#39;t be and you&#39;ll get
ulcers and you&#39;ll worry and you&#39;ll feel
anxiety and you&#39;ll struggle. The answer
is not to be in control. You&#39;re not in
control. You&#39;re not in control of the
weather. You&#39;re not in control of other
people&#39;s opinions and views and
preferences and hopes and dreams and
moods and everything. You can control
your own body. It can get sick and it
gets old. I don&#39;t care if you want it to
or not. Life has its rhythm.
Rhythm means nice song. And the songs
aren&#39;t always so nice. It writes songs,
too. Okay? And it can write the blues.
And it can write the funeral march. And
it can write rights of spring, can&#39;t it?
It can write all songs. Weather can be
bombing. It can be stormy. It&#39;s not
under your control.
This is part of waking up and becoming
mature on the path. If they teach you
how to control it, they&#39;re teaching you
because you&#39;re not going to control it.
No one ever did. No one ever will. I
don&#39;t know what to say to you. And I
hope you hope you disagree because if
you disagree, then you really need this
talk. Life is not under your control. It
is not meant to be. It&#39;s not supposed to
be. If you get the way you want, I don&#39;t
get the way I want. And then you wanted
a certain way yesterday. You want it a
different way today. Do you ever change
your mind? Well, we&#39;re neurotic.
And so it becomes a real fundamental
understanding on I call the path of
life. You can call it a spiritual path
if you want. It has been here on this
planet for 4.5
billion years.
It made all the trees, all the animals,
the entire evolution of everything. It
made and created the 35 trillion cells
that make up your body. It made your
eyeballs. It made everything. What did
life? Are you in control of any of that?
In control of the sun shining, in
control of the weather. I don&#39;t even
talk about it. You&#39;re not in control of
anything really. If you stop and look at
it is what it means to look down to
start with. Look down. Are you in
control of your body? I can eat what I
want. And when you swallow it, what
happens? It just sits down there. No.
hormones and acids and stomach things
and then they break down and then it
goes down and it gets passed through the
capillaries and it feeds the you don&#39;t
eat for you. Your body cells need to
eat. So the reality is every single
thing in your life not every single
thing maybe 0.000000001% 01%
have the effect of something you&#39;re
doing. But I I started a business was
doing well and then a competitor came
Then this happened, that happened. I got
sick. Anything can happen. You&#39;re not in
control. I don&#39;t Do you not like when I
tell you that? They want to tell you
you&#39;re in control. You&#39;re not in
control. That&#39;s a ridiculous thing. If
you take a list of every single thing
that h all right why do you not fall
through the floor you have to be a
physicist do you fall through the floor
do you stand up on top of the floor are
you making it so you don&#39;t fall through
the floor no
why don&#39;t you fall through the floor
because there are these things called
covealent and ionic bonds that bond
together molecules and they&#39;re strong
some of them and other ones aren&#39;t as
strong air the microructures holding
together air are Very nice. You walk
right through them, they break. The
floor doesn&#39;t do that.
Well, what if I shove up and down real
hard? You&#39;ll break your bones. Unless
the floor&#39;s soft, then you&#39;ll fall
through. It&#39;s not you doing any of this.
It&#39;s creation. It&#39;s life creating
everything. All the planets, all the
stars. Well, if I jump up and down, why
doesn&#39;t the planet move? They say for
every action there&#39;s an equal and
opposite reaction. Well, I bam, man. I
jumped on top of the floor. It didn&#39;t
break. It passed the energy through.
Energy neither created or destroyed. How
come the planet doesn&#39;t move when I
jump? Because it&#39;s circling the sun and
their centrial force and gravity
offsetting each other. It&#39;s invisible as
could be. But it&#39;s why the planet
doesn&#39;t move when you jump. Otherwise,
it it moves. All right. Do you want to
know all this? Of course you want to
know all this. But at least be wise
enough to understand you&#39;re not doing
it. making the sunshine. You make the
sunshine. What if the sun didn&#39;t shine?
You ain&#39;t here. Whole planet ain&#39;t here.
That&#39;s one star out of 300 billion that
have to be in harmony and working with
each other so that everything stays in
the same place. You know, I could talk
about this forever. Why? Because I want
your mind to understand you are not in
control. You are not in control. The
things that matter in your life the most
have nothing to do with you. They&#39;re
just the way things are. Why the atoms
bond the way they do? How did all your
cells make themselves into pancreases
and pineal glands and hormones and how
how did all that happen? You say, &#34;I
know teacher the DNA molecule.&#34; Well,
you know that&#39;s neat that you understand
that that a baby&#39;s DNA molecule knows
how to make the entire body. A single
cell microscopic cell has the
intelligence in it based on the DNA
molecule how the genes are on the
molecule to make the whole body. The
mother doesn&#39;t make the body doesn&#39;t
make an eyeball. Don&#39;t have to every
single thing that matters is already
happening. It&#39;s way bigger than anything
you&#39;re doing. It it creates the stage on
which your little ego says I&#39;m in
charge. If it wasn&#39;t happening, there
ain&#39;t nothing going on. Where did the
DNA molecule come from? It&#39;s pretty
brilliant, right? You didn&#39;t make it. It
made itself out of nothing. It put
itself together over time. The molecule,
the molecular structures were such that
the basic laws ended up binding those
together. It has nothing to do with you.
Yet, it is essential to your life. It&#39;s
beyond essential. Everything that is the
most essential thing to your life has
nothing to do with you. Nothing. It&#39;s
the truth. It&#39;s the absolute truth. What
has science showed us that it&#39;s not even
here? They&#39;ve gotten down to quantum
fields with little vibrations in them
and that&#39;s what&#39;s creating all the
molecules and all the atoms and so on
and you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. You
don&#39;t even know anything but it creates
everything. How come when you wake up in
the morning your bed and your dresser
and everything is still there? Did you
work hard at all night? Do you
understand? There&#39;s absolutely no reason
they would still be there for them to be
there. the quantum fields which are
random. You know, there&#39;s this
probability of where an electron would
be. There&#39;s no space where it is. It
takes billions and billions of them and
they tend to average here. Well, every
single one had to end up in the same
place for your dresser to stay there. If
you study this stuff, it should blow
your mind. Nothing is given. It&#39;s not
true that God created the heavens and
earth. It is being created every single
millisecond. Otherwise, it&#39;s not here.
It&#39;s not like there was some superlue
and we we glued your dresser there. No,
your dress is made up of atoms and the
atoms bond together when now and the
atoms aren&#39;t even there. They&#39;re just
electronic protons, subatomic particles,
but they&#39;re not even there. Ultimately,
it&#39;s down to these wave agitations in a
quantum field and they have behavior
patterns that bond together that behave
together, interact together, and create
electron protons which put themselves
together. That&#39;s happening every moment
for anything to be the way it is.
Einstein said something really
beautiful. He said, &#34;Reality is an
illusion, albeit a very persistent one,
quote unquote.&#34; And what do you mean by
reality? Every single thing you&#39;re
interacting with, every moment of your
life, everything you think, you see,
everything you every single thing. So
there&#39;s the start of a spiritual
foundation. It has nothing to do with
It&#39;s here without you. It was here way
before you came. And guess what happen
when you leave? It will still be, won&#39;t
it? All the meaningful things, the
hundreds and billions and trillions of
things that make the universe has
nothing to do with this you who&#39;s
sitting there saying, &#34;I&#39;m in charge and
I know how I want it to be and why can&#39;t
it be the way I want it to be?&#34; And so
you wake up and you realize okay why
can&#39;t I stay in a beautiful loving
peaceful meditative state because you
have done something with your mind that
should be against the law. We just don&#39;t
know any better. You have a mind not
just a physical form. You have a mind.
I&#39;ve discussed that with you. What is
the mind? It&#39;s a superco computer beyond
anything you could ever comprehend. It
can do anything. Can go anywhere. It
developed rocket ships. It made
nighttime light. Look what your mind
did. It&#39;s phenomenal what it can do. And
it&#39;s supposed to do that. It&#39;s a higher
aspect of your being. But something it
did do that&#39;s a major problem. Is it
said there are ways I like things to be
and there are ways I don&#39;t like things
to be. I don&#39;t care how they&#39;re supposed
to be. I don&#39;t care how God made them. I
don&#39;t care what physics says. I don&#39;t
care. I want it to be my way. That&#39;s a
problem because if you heard me tell you
it is not your way, it is not supposed
to be your way. Do you breathe? Does
your heart beat? Do you make it happen?
You do not make your heartbeat. It
happens by itself all day. You&#39;re busy
doing other things. The heart keeps
beating, doesn&#39;t it? 70, 80, 90 times a
minute. Okay. Well, you wouldn&#39;t last
too long if it wasn&#39;t. Everything&#39;s like
It&#39;s all happening by itself. But you&#39;re
in here building a mind that says I, me,
I have collected thoughts of experience
I&#39;ve had before of the world. And some
of them I like and some of them I don&#39;t
like. Do you like Saturn? Do you like
the fact that Pluto is way out there? Do
you like the fact that Jupiter has a
storm? I couldn&#39;t care less about that.
Oh, so you couldn&#39;t care less about
99.999999999999999999999999%
of the universe, but you really care
about the point of what? So, we&#39;re given
this gift of a body and breathing and
everything and you&#39;re here on this
beautiful planet that built itself and
it&#39;s taking care of itself and
manifesting all the time. It&#39;s just it&#39;s
amazing. And you&#39;re having experiences.
That&#39;s the purpose of life to have
experiences for God to experience
himself. Created the heavens and earth
and now he&#39;s visiting in the form of
you. his experience is creation. I&#39;ve
told you before over and over the moment
you experience no one else has ever
experienced. Not literally the moment
you&#39;re experiencing how you&#39;re standing,
what you&#39;re seeing, what&#39;s happening.
Only you are experiencing that
experience. No one ever will, no one
ever did. And then the next experience,
same thing. Every single moment of your
life, you&#39;re having unique experiences
that only you are having and will ever
have. Wow. What do you do with it? You
make a royal mess out of that. Instead
of sitting there saying thank you, thank
you. Wow, look what happened now. Wow,
look at the experiences unfolding in
front of me. I&#39;m not creating it. I I
can&#39;t keep saying it over and over
again. Please hold on the moment in
front of you. How much of it did you
make? How many of the cars are driving
by? How many of the trees that you
looked at? How much white lines? How
many clouds? How much of this did you
make? Did you make this moment? No, you
didn&#39;t make any of it. But what do you
do? You experience it. You&#39;re supposed
to experience it. Your consciousness
experiences the moment. That&#39;s
beautiful. But then you do something
very weird. You take this thing called
the computer mind. You&#39;re supposed to
have a mind. There&#39;s nothing wrong with
mind. It can can get knowledge and study
things and create and and explore and
music and art and and engineering and
rocket science and and AI and look what
he can do. It&#39;s a phenomenal thing,
isn&#39;t it? What did you do with yours?
You had the unique experience that were
given to you and instead of experiencing
them and being open to the next
experience and letting them all create
the beauty of your inner being, you
decided I liked that experience and I
didn&#39;t like that experience.
I liked when the dog barked when he was
my dog, but I didn&#39;t like when the dog
barked if he was a pitbull. Okay? I
liked if I saw a snake and it was the
kind I like but not his rattlesnake.
These are moments unfolding in front of
you. They have nothing to do with you.
But you took that moment and instead of
letting it merge into this brilliant
computer mind of yours as a piece of
information as a beautiful experience
you had. Doesn&#39;t mean you pick up the
rattlesnake. You learn pick the things
up right. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to
hold on to this experience and say I
never want this to happen again. It
scared me so much right that what you
did this is what you this is the core of
what I&#39;m talking about. So you took this
beautiful mind just like the world is
amazing place isn&#39;t it? Your body is
amazing everything&#39;s amazing. So is your
mind. But what you did with your mind is
this experience came in and instead of
letting it be an experience you had and
pour into your consciousness and just
learn from it and grow from it and be
part of it and let it be part of you.
How of snakes? I saw a rous snake once,
right? Was it scary? Yeah, it was
beautiful. Okay. A storm came when I was
little in a hurricane. It blew trees. Oh
my god, it was so exciting. And then we
got to clean up and hear me. You had
experiences. What&#39;s wrong with that? You
in there, you who lives in there, the
consciousness who is the recipient of
all these experiences, who is given this
beautiful body and a beautiful mind and
a beautiful heart. You are the soul, the
self, the atman, the consciousness that
dwells in there. I rather wait till the
end to tell you that consciousness is
God consciousness. There&#39;s only one
conscious, the whole universe. That
which is aware that it is is aware of
itself is consciousness. Objects aren&#39;t
aware of themselves. You&#39;re aware of
them. You are consciousness. So that
consciousness drops down here to
experience his creation. And you are
God&#39;s emissary as I teach you. You&#39;re
God&#39;s ambassador emissary to experience
the moment that no one else will ever
experience. And it&#39;s all the same God
consciousness. But it has to have 8.3
billion people plus all the insects and
everything in order to experience
creation, right? That&#39;s what&#39;s actually
happening. The one consciousness is
splitting itself to look down through
your eyes. You&#39;re a sacred being and
it&#39;s experiencing. That&#39;s how it&#39;s meant
to be. That&#39;s the garden. Adam and Eve
were in the garden. Everything was fine.
Of course, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s always fine.
Look, it&#39;s beyond fine. It&#39;s
incomprehensible. But what you did and
that tree was called the tree of
self-nowledge. You had an experience.
The consciousness did. And it did
something really weird. It said, &#34;I
don&#39;t like that.&#34;
Whoa. What&#39;s that? I don&#39;t like that.
When you go to a movie and sit in a
theater, did you make the movie? Are you
in charge of what&#39;s happening next? No.
You&#39;re the recipient. Well, that&#39;s the
same thing out here. It&#39;s unfolding. How
about the movie? Something happened. You
said, &#34;I don&#39;t like that. I don&#39;t want
to see that.&#34; Well, you&#39;re not going to
like that movie very much, are you?
That&#39;s what you did with your mind. You
judged and you stored events that came
in. You were meant to experience them.
They&#39;re your events. They&#39;re playing
your song. They came in. You had the
experience, but you didn&#39;t let it go
through. You clung to it. It&#39;s Buddhing.
Please understand what these words mean.
It&#39;s an event that came in through your
senses and it&#39;s passing through your
mind and heart so it can merge into your
consciousness and be experienced fully.
Like when you sit there and said, &#34;Oh,
it touched me to the depth of my being.&#34;
Every single experience is meant to
touch you to the depth of your being.
Ever have something touch you the depth
of your being? I felt it was in the
presence of God at that sunset or when
you held me and kissed me the first
time. Everything is supposed to be like
that. Everything is like that. It&#39;s just
the variety of the creation of God of
creation. It comes in. But you, the
consciousness, have free will. And one
thing you can do with that free will is
not let that experience to pass through.
You have the ability to hold on to it,
to stop it in your mind so it stays
stuck in your mind. So that you see a
snake go crawling by, but it&#39;s not gone
when it&#39;s gone. It&#39;s gone. Here&#39;s the
next event. You don&#39;t see the next event
because in your mind the snake is still
there. There nothing wrong with the
snake being if you want to bring it
back. Remember what it looked like. You
have a storage memory. But that&#39;s not
what happens here. You don&#39;t let it make
it all the way through. So you can bring
it back. You push it down. AC Freud
resistance, depression, repression. It&#39;s
all the same stuff. You push it and hold
it in your mind so it&#39;s there at night.
and you tell your husband about it and
you tell your chits about it. 15 years
later you talk about that snake that
scared you. Okay? So you held these
things in your mind. That is what we
mean by the personal mind. Why is it
personal? Because it&#39;s going on inside
yours is not going on inside his. He
didn&#39;t have the experiences you did and
he didn&#39;t feel about them the same as
you did based on blah blah blah blah
blah. Pretty complicated what goes on in
there, isn&#39;t it? No, it&#39;s not. There&#39;s
just experiences of reality passing
through. But it gets pretty complicated
when they don&#39;t pass through. Now that I
held on to the snake, I&#39;m afraid of baby
rattles. I&#39;m afraid of coiled ropes.
I have made a royal mess of this sacred
place called my mind.
Let&#39;s go really slowly. Don&#39;t don&#39;t
close down yet. I have made a royal mess
of this sacred gift that was given to me
called my mind. My open mind that can
think and create and but it can&#39;t
anymore. Why? Because the things I
stored in there, the personal things
that I stored in there, the vast
majority of which were scary,
uncomfortable, I didn&#39;t like, you have
not suppressed a whole lot of things you
like so much. It does some. You&#39;ve held
on to things. Oh, I hope this happens
again. But nothing compared to every
moment of your life. You&#39;re having
experiences you don&#39;t want to have.
Okay, I got you. I&#39;ve now built the
personal mind. What is the personal
mind? a subset of this expansive
universal mind that can think of
anything. Think of galaxies. If I tell
you there&#39;s a quantum field with
vibration, you get a concept what&#39;s
going on. If I tell you there&#39;s 300
billion stars in your galaxy, you can
see a galaxy. Armadillos can&#39;t do that.
I guarantee you right now. Okay? You
have the ability to explore your
expansive mind. You have an expansive
How deep can I tell you? Ramach Krishna
fully enlightened. By the time we&#39;re
done, you&#39;ll understand what enlightened
means. Fully enlightened made the
following statement. The purified mind
is no different from the self.
The purified mind is no different from
the self. Other words, if a mind doesn&#39;t
swear, I get to be with God. No, that&#39;s
not the purified mind. The purified mind
is the one that doesn&#39;t do what we just
talked about. It didn&#39;t hold on to
specific past experiences that now are
defining your personal mind which your
consciousness is caught in. What do I
want? How do I get it? Am I happy? What
if this happens? Does the mind do that?
Is it capable of thinking of a galaxy?
Yes. How often does it do it? Never.
Okay. If I make you do it, I try to. If
I make you do it, you might for a
moment. Oh, look. All right. But
otherwise, it&#39;s right back here. That&#39;s
why you come down after meditation. I
realize that because I stored inside a
part of my mind, a very small part of my
mind, I stored scary stuff. I stored the
stuff that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with in
the past or things that I want to happen
again or things I don&#39;t want to happen
again. And then that part of my mind is
very active, is it not? It&#39;s always
worrying that I do wrong. What should I
do? I shouldn&#39;t have said that. Oh my
god. Well, I should tell somebody. But
what is it doing? You know, what is this
eye? There&#39;s no eye. There&#39;s just
universal consciousness experiencing the
moments that are unfolding in front of
it. But no, not not now. There&#39;s not.
Now there&#39;s this noise going on in
there. Most of it&#39;s worry, isn&#39;t it?
Fears and desires. What are those? What
is a fear? What is a fear? I&#39;m sitting
here. You&#39;re sitting here. What&#39;s the
problem? A fear is something I stored
inside myself that was scary as hell and
it keeps pulling me back into it. What
is a desire? an experience I had once
that felt better than I feel now and I
want it to happen again. That&#39;s the
core. And then the mind thinks about how
do I get it to happen again? What do I
have to do? That doesn&#39;t have to be
going on in there. That is not natural
that you&#39;re caught in this personal tiny
little thing called you. The mind is
part of the whole universe. Everything&#39;s
expansive and whole, which is where you
go if you meditate deep. But you come
back quick, don&#39;t you? And so catch on
that you did this. You did this. You
didn&#39;t know any better. I&#39;m not blaming
you. But you use the power of your will
to hold on to these moments that have
happened in your life and build a
concept of yourself. Tiny little thing.
It&#39;s tiny. It&#39;s so small. It&#39;s only
about you. Is the whole world only about
you? I try to teach this over and over
again. Well, there&#39;s 8.3 billion people
alive right now that ain&#39;t about you.
are they? You wish they were, but
they&#39;re not. What are they about? The
things they held on to and they had
different experiences than you. If any
part of you get it will liberate you.
Any moment you&#39;re having experience, how
many are you missing?
I&#39;m challenging you. How many other
experiences are going on everywhere that
you&#39;re not having at the moment you&#39;re
having that one experience? 700 billion
zillion quillion and if you had one of
those instead of the one you&#39;re having
your mind would be different. You had
held on something different. So
everybody has had different experiences
and everybody has held on to different
experiences and they built this thing
called the self-concept called the ego.
It&#39;s a subset of mind that is caught in
itself thinking about what I like, what
I don&#39;t like, what I want, what I don&#39;t
want, who I like, who I don&#39;t like, what
happened in the past that I don&#39;t like,
what happened in the past that I do
like, what do I do about it, how can I
change this, how can I feel better, who
I need to find, I need to change my
relationship, I need to change my
weight, I need to change my height. It&#39;s
just this noise
that never stops about I, me, mine. And
what it&#39;s trying to do is to say, I&#39;m
not okay. Make me be okay. Figure out I
need to figure out how to be okay. I
have to figure out what I think I need
and then figure how to get it. It&#39;s
called strategy and tactic. It&#39;s called
war. What&#39;s my strategy to get what I
want? Let me feel better. Then what&#39;s my
tactic to do it? This is what it&#39;s like
to live in there. Now I said first look
down. You&#39;re trying to look up. Oh, look
up. I can&#39;t look up, man. There&#39;s junk
going on inside. You tell me what to do.
I take the name of God all you want,
right? It&#39;s coming right back down. No,
I&#39;m I&#39;m using affirmation. Positive
affirmation. Why? Because otherwise it&#39;s
negatives can be in there and I have to
struggle to do affirmation, which is all
fine. Just understand why it is the way
it is.
So now you&#39;ve built this thing inside
your mind. It&#39;s scary as could be. You
worry all the time. You have anxiety and
stress. That&#39;s why
you don&#39;t have to make the world run. It
runs itself.
All the things I talked about to start
with. Oh my god, the baby made itself.
Your body takes care of itself. The
heart beats itself. It all happens by
If you think it doesn&#39;t, next time you
wake up in the morning, decide for one
day you have to make your heartbeat. Do
this and you have to make your lungs go
and see how much work you get done.
It goes on by itself. It&#39;s miraculous
all of it. But you build this thing in
there called the ego, called the
self-concept, called the personal mind.
It&#39;s just a little subset of thoughts
that keep talking. They&#39;re busy. They&#39;re
neurotic. And that&#39;s why when you leave
meditation or loving hug, that moment
don&#39;t last very long. We&#39;re having a
moment. You ask how long it&#39;ll last,
too? Cuz this sucker&#39;s coming right
back, pulling your awareness down into
it. I use the word distracting. It is
rather distracting. It distracts your
consciousness all the time until that&#39;s
who you are. That&#39;s who you think you
are. this thing in here that likes that
and doesn&#39;t like that and wants that.
I&#39;m the person that had that experience
when I was young. My parents got
divorced. I was so unhappy. That&#39;s who I
am. It is not who you are. You&#39;re the
person that had the experience. You
still exist if you didn&#39;t have the
experience. I had this terrible
experience. My husband did this, that,
and the other thing. Oh my god, I&#39;ll
never be the same. Well, what if your
husband didn&#39;t do that? What if you
never got married? Would you exist?
Would you still be in there? Of course
you would. You&#39;re not the experience you
had. You&#39;re the one that had the
experience. You&#39;re the consciousness
that had the experience, but you
couldn&#39;t handle it. Now, we&#39;re getting
down to your work. You, the
consciousness, couldn&#39;t handle the
experience you had. And so, you did what
I consider the funniest thing in the
whole world. I learned this way back. I
know in the early &#39;7s, right? What a
dumb thing to do. If I have an
experience I didn&#39;t like, it comes and
it goes. It&#39;s gone. And I got inside of
me. I&#39;m keeping that sucker. I didn&#39;t
like it.
Why would you keep what you don&#39;t like?
You&#39;re driving down the street and
somebody runs a red light. You ram on
your brakes and you skid and you didn&#39;t
hit. Nothing happened. You will never
forget that for the rest of your life.
Now you&#39;re scared to go in the car. You
don&#39;t drive down that road. Don&#39;t drive
down that road. That was that&#39;s so very
dangerous. It&#39;s not any more dangerous
than it was before you did that. But to
you it is, isn&#39;t it? So you held inside
of you the worst thing you could ever
store. that which bothered you the most.
That&#39;s the entire foundation of
psychology. But you don&#39;t know how not
to do it. And now it&#39;s so reactive that
it&#39;s just there&#39;s so much junk in there.
So now where you live, where your
consciousness lives is staring at that
distracting little bundle of thoughts
called my ego, called me, called my
self-concept, and it&#39;s always active.
Try to go to sleep at night sometimes,
then shut up. Have something happen.
have something almost happened. Have
something that you thought maybe could
happen bother Jenna. You don&#39;t want to
live there. I don&#39;t want you to live
there. You do not have to live there.
You do not have to live like that. But
if you store this garbage in there,
what&#39;s going to happen is your
consciousness is going to stare at it
cuz it&#39;s scary and it&#39;s noisy. It&#39;s way
noisier than the dog that was barking
and it&#39;s way worse than a pitbull. And
so now your consciousness is distracted
by that all the time.
That&#39;s why they tell you work with your
mind. But I would like to say instead
work with your mind. Find out why your
mind is the way it is. Buddhist say work
at the root. Work at the root of why
that noisy crazy thing is always in
there doing that messing everything up.
You fall in love. It says careful. Slow
down. You&#39;re going to get hurt. You got
hurt before. You want to live like that?
because you do not have to live like
that. You&#39;re not meant to live like
that. That is not a reasonable life to
live. So, first you look down. It&#39;s
called witness consciousness. You don&#39;t
try to fix it. You don&#39;t try to change
anything. You just say, &#34;All right, I&#39;m
going to notice what&#39;s going on down
there.&#34; Why is it down there? Because
your consciousness is the highest seat
there is. The conscious is the highest
seat there is. Everything is below your
consciousness. You&#39;re looking down. Just
like you look down at the ground, you
look down at your thoughts. A lot of
people say to me, &#34;I don&#39;t know what you
mean.&#34; Well, someday you&#39;ll know what I
mean. You&#39;ll sit in a seat and your
thoughts are always below you.
Everything is going on. You have to look
down, not down outside, look down
inside, and you&#39;ll see that they are a
mess. And so, you decide at some point,
this is the your spiritual awakening. I
don&#39;t want that going on down there.
That&#39;s not much fun. And the concept
that it wants me to do what it said it
to make it be okay. Who&#39;s guiding things
around here? Cuz this broken part of me
is telling me what I got to do and what
everybody else has got to do for me to
be okay. Why don&#39;t I just fix the darn
thing so it&#39;s not broken? That&#39;s
spirituality.
When you understand Roomie once wrote,
&#34;Yesterday I was clever, so I was trying
to change the world. Today I&#39;m wise so
I&#39;m changing myself.
That&#39;s the spiritual change. That&#39;s when
you woke up. How do you do that? Okay.
Well, let&#39;s be a little more positive.
Can you fix it? Yes, you can fix it. Can
everyone fix it? Yes, everyone can fix
it. Will it happen immediately? No, it
will not happen immediately. You&#39;ve made
a royal mess in there and you&#39;re
addicted to it and it&#39;s got control over
you and you still live your life as
though getting what it wants is what&#39;s
going to make you happy. Don&#39;t you? If
you get what you want, it&#39;ll be okay. If
I avoid what I don&#39;t want, I&#39;ll be okay.
That&#39;s the principle of the lost mind of
a lost soul. But you start watching and
you realize, well, maybe I don&#39;t have to
do this. Maybe I can be okay with
reality. Maybe I can be okay that life
built everything. Every moment it&#39;s
building everything. Maybe that can be
okay with me. Instead of me saying, &#34;No,
it better not do what it&#39;s been doing
for 4.5 billion years. the earth. It
better do what I want it to do right
now. And if I change my mind, it better
do it different. I told you my favorite
is this. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s raining on
my birthday. Has to be raining. It
doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s your birthday. I
guarantee you the rain knows nothing
about your birthday. But you&#39;re getting
upset, aren&#39;t you? All right. This is
called getting out. This is when the
soul, the inward consciousness has woken
up enough to say
used to be a song in the 60s. We got to
get out of this place. If it&#39;s the last
thing we ever do, that&#39;s what it starts
to look like. No way I&#39;m living in here,
not without garbage going on. I can&#39;t
have a decent life, nor can anyone
around me because I&#39;m a manipulative
person that&#39;s trying to control everyone
to be the way I need them to be. Okay.
And so you start by getting your
bearings. Just get your bearings. Can
you dare to watch? Don&#39;t change a single
thing. Can you dare to watch the
absurdity that is going on inside your
personal mind? And can you dare someday
to listen to this talk and realize, yep,
that son of a gun thinks everything
should be the way it wants. If things
are not the way you want, you say
they&#39;re wrong.
If someone behaves in a way you didn&#39;t
expect, they&#39;re wrong, aren&#39;t they? You
start watching this and you realize the
ego is a mess. That personal mind is a
mess. It will never be okay. It can&#39;t be
okay. Its foundation is absurd. And so
your first step, you watch, then you
start to work with it. Me, I started a
fight with it. Shut up. I want to hear
from you. Right? And I learned very
quickly that that didn&#39;t help one single
I just made more of a mess. So how do
you work with that? My experience is
first you be gentle. That thing it
doesn&#39;t want to be that broken. You
stored every single thing ever bothered
inside of it. Of course it&#39;s bothered,
isn&#39;t it? Of course it&#39;s disturbed. Of
course it&#39;s not happy. Of course it
thinks it needs to do things to be okay.
You made a mess in there. So you start,
you look at it without reaction, without
judgment, and you apologize.
You did it. I mean, I did it. If it
comes back up, what do you do? Push it
back down. You know what? That&#39;s not
coming back up, do you? You&#39;re doing
this. You&#39;re holding it that way. You&#39;re
creating your ego. You create that
thing. So you look down and you say,
&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
You apologize to your psyche. What is
the psyche? A collection of thoughts
that you built. They&#39;re not the
consciousness. They&#39;re something you&#39;re
conscious of. But just like you have a
body, don&#39;t abuse the darn thing. Don&#39;t
beat it. Take care of it. You have a
mind. A beautiful mind. And you abused
it. You stored every single thing that
happened to you that you didn&#39;t like
inside your mind. That&#39;s what psychology
taught you. That&#39;s what Freud taught
you. You did do that. And now it keeps
trying to come back up. You keep pushing
it down. and it just created all this
disturbance in there. So, you get
centered enough and meditation helps
with that. Now, you&#39;re using meditation
properly. You look down at it and you
it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. I can
work with you. I can work with the
psyche. I can liberate you. I can free
you. You don&#39;t want to get things the
way you want. You want to honor,
respect, and love things the way they
are so you can be free. It&#39;s called Jan
Mukta, a liberated being. And so, what
do you do? I teach you this. It took me
a long time to catch on to it. You start
with the tiny little things that happen
in your everyday life. If you have all
that stuff stored in there, and you do,
you know, you do, what good is it if
you&#39;re going to put more in there, you
reach the point, these are different
stages of your growth. You reach the
point where you say, &#34;Man, that&#39;s hard
to get rid of stuff. Wow, is it making a
mess? If I even think of something that
bothered me when I was four years old,
it bothers me. I ain&#39;t putting no more
in there. There. That&#39;s now we&#39;re going
step by step. I am not putting more in
there. That is the purpose of my day.
The purpose of my life. The purpose of
my life is not to get an A or not to
earn a million dollars or not to marry
somebody that I really love. No. No.
They can happen. I&#39;m not saying the
purpose of my life. I ain&#39;t put no more
in there. It&#39;s ridiculous trying to live
with that. So, you start practicing
what&#39;s called acceptance,
surrender, letting go.
You know those are teachings. What does
that mean? Something happened out there.
You said something. I wasn&#39;t sure what
you meant, but I didn&#39;t like it.
If it meant what I thought it meant, I
didn&#39;t like it. You&#39;re about to store
another one in there. And you&#39;re not
going to like her next time you see her.
You hear me? You just lost a friend
because your mind thought that maybe she
said something you didn&#39;t like. Ever
done that? But you don&#39;t even start with
that. You start with the simple things.
I told you. The fact that it&#39;s hot out,
the weather, the fact that the driver in
front of you doesn&#39;t drive the way you
want, the fact that somebody is wearing
something that offends you or smell, I
don&#39;t care. Any stupid little thing, and
notice your tendency to suppress, your
tendency to resist, your tendency to
push away anything your mind says, &#34;I
don&#39;t like.&#34; And you start saying, &#34;No,
I don&#39;t want to do that anymore.&#34; And
you work with yourself. There&#39;s so many
ways to you can use affirmation. I love
the weather. I love this. If you think
somebody said something you don&#39;t like,
I love it. I love it. But what if they
meant something really nice? I love it.
What if they really meant to dish you?
Oh, I love it. It&#39;s called affirmation.
You neutralize this stuff before you
store it. When? All the time. Well, why
would I? because of the cost that you
take on if you store it. You&#39;re sitting
on a little planet in the middle of
nowhere&#39;s somebody said something. Let&#39;s
screw yourself up about it. That&#39;s your
choice. Or step back on the planet. I do
it all the time. Just step back on the
planet. Spin through the middle of
nowhere like it&#39;s like a a little seat
that you sit on top of the planet.
You&#39;re big and it&#39;s just spinning around
nowhere. I told you what did you do
today? a 360
around my axis. I rotate it. I do it
this year. A 360 around a star. There&#39;s
300 billion in your galaxy and there&#39;s
two trillion galaxies all with hundreds
of billions. What did she say that
bothered you? Are you willing to do that
every single time with the new things
that are coming in? You have a choice.
Be bothered or don&#39;t be bothered. But
shouldn&#39;t I be bothered? No. If my body
is hurting me, should I beat it? No. Why
would you beat it? That&#39;s not rational
behavior. If my mind is causing problems
in there, should I get into them? No.
You just sit there and say, &#34;I can
handle this. I can handle the weather. I
can handle the driver in front of me. I
can handle what you said. I couldn&#39;t
care what you meant. Who cares? You&#39;re
in a bad mood tomorrow.&#34; Now, have you
noticed? You probably have never. I I
made him I tested him a long time ago.
The vast majority of what you think is
going on is not going on. The vast
majority of what you think is going on
inside somebody else&#39;s head is not going
on. You are projecting your fears and
anxieties and desires because you have
to look through the veil of that mind. I
told you don&#39;t do this. It&#39;s not nice.
Don&#39;t do this. But in my early days when
I saw this stuff going on in there and
he was carrying on about those people
were talking about him or this or that
or somebody was saying something, I
would walk right up to that person and
say, &#34;Did you really mean to say what I
thought you said? I don&#39;t even know the
person.&#34; &#34;No, I know what you&#39;re talking
about.&#34; And I&#39;d show him, &#34;You&#39;re crazy.
You&#39;re crazy. And I used to listen to
you. No wonder I had such a rough life.
I&#39;m looking through the veil of that
which is programmed for me to have
trouble. Like I stored everything to
have trouble before. Now don&#39;t do that.
Just let go. Okay. It came in. It felt
disturbing. I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t want
it to not happen again. I don&#39;t care. I
would rather have it happen again than
stored inside myself forever when it
never happens again. And you learn to
let it go. So, how would you like to
have a relationship with somebody that
if they&#39;re in a bad mood, they said
something and you didn&#39;t hold it against
them? You just, you know, an hour went
by, you said, &#34;Oh, let&#39;s go play.&#34; Now,
why&#39; you say that? That&#39; be a nice
relationship, wouldn&#39;t it? You&#39;re
hanging out with a pretty high dude or
This is what it means to grow
spiritually. Does meditation help? Of
course it does. It lets you get above it
and have a little vacation. Divications
help? Yes. But you have to come back.
Well, I don&#39;t want that to be what your
meditation is. A vacation only time you
get a little vacation, then you come
right back to all that garbage. Yes,
meditate. Do do your work, whatever you
want to do. But when you&#39;re down here,
clean up one. Don&#39;t take on anymore. I&#39;m
begging you. Don&#39;t take on anymore. It&#39;s
not worth it, is it? Have you seen how
easy it is to get scarred in there? for
somebody to say something, you to think
something and it stays in there and
keeps coming back and next time you see
them and you see something on TV, yes or
no? Takes one second to get stored in
there and it could take years to get it
out. Therapy, meditation, you got stuff
in there like that. I don&#39;t want you to
have that in there. You don&#39;t need to
have that in there. Period. It is not
natural. It&#39;s not meant to be. And so
what you do is you start practicing
letting go. It comes in, you hit
something and you decide. That&#39;s what
meditation can give you. That moment of
consciousness where you decide, do I
want more stuff in here or do I want
out? That&#39;s your choice. Every minute
that&#39;s your choice. And at some point
you&#39;ll say, &#34;I don&#39;t want more stuff in
here. I don&#39;t care what you meant. I
don&#39;t care how the driver in front of me
drove. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s hot out. I
don&#39;t care. Stop it. I ain&#39;t holding
this in there. And you learn to let it
go. How? My experience is relaxation is
the answer. Just like a yoga asa. How do
you do? Just relax into it. Force. No.
Relax. It will open up. As you relax
inside, you will tense against what
bothers you. You will tense. Resist that
which doesn&#39;t feel good. Relax instead
of resisting.
That&#39;s the entire path. That&#39;s the
entire path. Relax instead of resisting.
And when you relax, he gave it room to
pass through. Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll pass
through every time. It may not. So, let
it go tonight. Let it go tomorrow. Every
time it comes back up, don&#39;t yell at it.
Don&#39;t get mad. Just let it go. And it
will leave less of a mark on you than if
you had resisted. For something to leave
a mark, there has to be resistance. And
so, your resistance is what makes it
stay in there. So if you relax through
it, then what happens? Now it becomes
very easy. Now all of a sudden you&#39;re
happier. They remind me all the time. Oh
my god, it works. I&#39;m so much happier.
My relationships are better. Of course
they are. You&#39;re not polluting every
single thing inside and outside of you.
But then what&#39;s going to happen? I&#39;m
warning you. Is something bigger is
going to come out by itself. All by
itself. Something you hadn&#39;t thought
about for a while. Some billboard makes
you think of it. Somebody says something
doesn&#39;t say something and you start
crying and you start feeling this pain
in your heart and so on. And what you
think is what did I do wrong? You didn&#39;t
do anything wrong. Everything you&#39;re
doing is right. That is the path. Now
that you&#39;ve stopped putting new stuff in
there, what about all that old stuff?
Oh, I&#39;m going have to go to therapy for
the rest of my life. No, fine. If you
want to do that, your therapist is life.
It will bring that stuff up, won&#39;t it?
Your everyday life will end up hitting
that stuff. Your choice is push it back
down. play the blame game or practice
letting go and eventually get to the
point you say, &#34;I don&#39;t care what comes
up, how big it is. I don&#39;t care what it
is. Bring it on because the meaning of
my life is that this stuff&#39;s not going
to be inside of me. And now all of a
sudden, the mind thins out by itself.&#34;
Not you have to learn techniques and all
this kind of stuff. Why did it thin out?
The reason it talks so much is you store
all that garbage in there. If you let
the garbage go naturally, just keep
relaxing through it. But what if it
really, really hurts? You decide. Would
you rather store the pain or let it go?
I know in my life, I can remember way
back in the 70s, early 80s, right, when
I was doing lasagna, I would see this
come up and Mickey was he was so trained
on this. He would say, &#34;Do you want that
to stay in there from now on or do you
want to get rid of it?&#34; But it hurts. No
pain, no gain.
It&#39;s called soul birth. Women go through
child birth. That&#39;s not always fun. You
go through soul birth and you start
little by little saying, &#34;I want this to
happen. I don&#39;t care what it feels like.
It&#39;s down there hurting anyways. It just
came up. I&#39;d rather have the hurt in
front of me or have the opportunity to
work with it, to let it go, to use
affirmation. At some point, you catch
on. I&#39;m still holding it. I&#39;m teetering
with I&#39;m trying to let go. You didn&#39;t
let it go. You caught it and don&#39;t know
what to do. You caught the tiger by the
tail, right? You caught it here and you
learn to offer it up. You learn to just
let go. Offer it up. Give it to God.
Just anything that comes up. Fine. Fine.
Let it go. Just keep offering it up.
Just find ways to stay open while this
garbage purifies through you. And you
will be able to do that. And every time
you do it, you get higher. Why? Because
it was blocking your energy. It was
messing you up. And all of a sudden, you
get higher and higher. Eventually,
that&#39;s where I have to stop right on
time. You&#39;re going to find out there&#39;s a
flow of energy inside of you. You hardly
knew anything about yogi.
You start feeling this rush of energy
coming up, not down. You were looking
down. This won&#39;t let you look down. It&#39;s
like a flow of holy water as the Bible
calls it coming up strong, powerful, so
that your consciousness can&#39;t look down
anymore. All right? It&#39;s forcing it to
look up. And it&#39;s so beautiful that your
consciousness doesn&#39;t want to look down
and therefore it&#39;s able to you know
Hercules when he cleaned out the Aian
stables. You know that story he was
given a task herculean task and he had
like one day or something to clean out
the stable. Well instead of going in
there with a shovel to clean it out he
was Hercules very strong. He redirected
the flow of a river to flow through and
boom we just washed it right out. That&#39;s
what the shocki does. That&#39;s what
happens when you let go enough and she
starts flowing up. She washes it out
while you&#39;re in ecstasy. She washes it
out. That&#39;s called the ascent. It just
all this energy starts flowing up that
takes you higher and higher. And then
you start being able to use more of your
mind because it&#39;s not lost in your
personal self. And people understand
that. They say, &#34;Well, what if something
happens that you&#39;re supposed to deal
with?&#34; You deal with it. But you don&#39;t
deal with it because you&#39;re not okay.
You don&#39;t deal with it because say, &#34;I
can&#39;t handle this.&#34; It&#39;s just something
that brought the universe gave you this
moment and you deal with it to the best
of your ability. Not personal, not need,
not desire, not fear. Just what can I do
to help? And every moment that passes by
you, that&#39;s your attitude. What can I do
to serve this moment? What can I do to
raise this moment? Because I&#39;m fine with
it. I have no trouble. Okay? So, we we
went the whole way. Hear me? from the
lowest aspect of your being that you&#39;re
lost staring at. You just made this
lowest part of your being the meaning of
your life. Your world is as small as
your ego. That&#39;s all it thinks about.
What do I want? What I not want? What
happened to me? Why was that fair? Was
not fair. Woo. It&#39;s just a tiny little
collection of thoughts and they&#39;re your
thoughts. Not even anybody else&#39;s. I
ain&#39;t living in that world. That&#39;s a
tiny little world, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not a
whole lot of fun either. This is how you
liberate yourself. All right. And the
shocki will take you the rest of the
way. All right? And we haven&#39;t even
talked about getting high. We start
getting a little bit liberated.
When you let go enough, that&#39;s where the
great masters went. That&#39;s where Christ
went. They say, &#34;My father and I are
one.&#34; Now you&#39;ve tuned back into the
part of you that had come down and was
experiencing the moments of life. But
you don&#39;t have to come down. You can
merge with the whole universe. And
that&#39;s where the great masters went. All
Can you see how sincere I am that you
could understand this? I love you. Why
would I want you to live in that tiny
little box that&#39;s so full of junk? The
garbage you held inside throughout your
life that&#39;s creating all these tiny
thoughts about yourself when you&#39;re
capable of being dancing the most
beautiful being ever walked the face of
the earth. Healing where you walk,
healing takes place everything. You&#39;re a
great being. But we get a little lost,
don&#39;t we?
Free yourself. Free yourself.
Jack or death.
