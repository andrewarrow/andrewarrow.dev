But who makes you laugh the most?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe Carlos.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Carlos made you laugh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, Carlos and I are incredibly close,
too. I mean, we shared half of a trailer
for the first six seasons, which you
know, I think the best way to sort of
equate that is like roommates. Like, you
know, you heard every time the other
person&#39;s toilet flushed, like you knew
too much about each other, boy. And so,
he and I are incredibly close.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You had to share like it&#39;s called a
double banger, folks. Now, you think
that after season 6, you were one of the
stars of the show. You had your own
trailer. Now, why why didn&#39;t that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m asking all these questions
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because it&#39;s show business. You know, at
the end of the day, the studio is
spending money and it&#39;s, you know, how
do they feel that money is best spent?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. But I know that for Smallville it
was like Tom, everyone else. And I made
it very clear that no, Lex Luthther is
not just anyone else. And it was it was
a tough battle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I fought for years. But um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And how did that go? How was that for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was it was the worst experience of my
life uh negotiating and and and dealing
with that. Um I almost walked I almost
walked there. It was it was a tumultuous
relationship for a while, but uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And do you feel like it was with you
know the creatives or more the studio?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, not creatives. I loved everybody. I
loved everybody on the set. I never had
a problem with anybody. I always was
joking around making everybody laugh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know. But it got to me when it came
time to negotiate. It&#39;s like I always
say this, but it&#39;s like when you I don&#39;t
care where you work. If you&#39;re working
for a company and the company&#39;s doing
really well and you&#39;re an important part
of that,
you should be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; compensated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; compensated. And so they didn&#39;t they
didn&#39;t agree with all that. And uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that sounds like an understatement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you. Uh I just But it really I
think my life was miserable for a good
two years until I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why do you think that is?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um because I allowed it to. It&#39;s It&#39;s my
fault. I allowed them to get to me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But I just
I I wasn&#39;t happy going to work for a
while and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because of how I was how they felt like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; how they felt about me, my perception of
how they felt about me. And I was right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what do you mean you were right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, um it was warranted. It was like
it wasn&#39;t like I was saying, you know, I
want this, I want that. It was just
like, &#34;Hey,
uh, I deserve at least this,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, this isn&#39;t like, you know,
it&#39;s like it&#39;s the story of Tom becoming
Superman and me, you know, me becoming
Lex.&#34; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s the real story of the show.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so, ended up, it it took a while,
but I made it happen. But I could see
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in The Flash, it&#39;s like there&#39;s the
Flash and then there&#39;s a lot of great
characters. So, I don&#39;t know how much
room you had to when you negotiated. I I
bet you were a little upset.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, of course, again, like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it just gets to you. It gets to anybody
out there who has a a job and they&#39;re
working their ass off and you know that
you&#39;re doing a good job. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then they&#39;re like, &#34;Well, here&#39;s
what we&#39;re giving you.&#34; It just makes
you want to go to work late.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I get it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I never went to work late, but I did. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neither did I.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I did have a migraine that I couldn&#39;t uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ah, I see. I see. I understand those
days. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And apparently, yeah, there was stuff.
But you But you you&#39;re not like that,
right? You don&#39;t you left
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I don&#39;t know I mean
I don&#39;t know that being a team player
served me. Do you know what I mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. You were you almost felt like you
allowed them to just walk all over you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It can feel like that. Absolutely. you
know, because I really pride myself on
being punctual and prepared and knowing
my lines and like doing my best and not
everyone works that way. And it&#39;s hard.
It was hard for me
when I felt like bad behavior was being
rewarded when people who weren&#39;t
behaving the same way I was, you know,
were receiving better, different,
whatever treatment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But, you know, at the end of the
day, it&#39;s like it&#39;s my job to keep my
side of the street clean. Like, I can
just focus on myself and decide. And
that&#39;s what you know, you know how it
is. When you sign on to a show, your
contract is for six years. And so, you
don&#39;t really have a lot of wiggle room
for those first many, many years. And
then when it came time to renegotiate at
various points, um you know, it truly is
that moment where you have to sit down
and sit with yourself and say, &#34;Okay,
like if I make this deal, if I accept
this deal, then I have accepted it.&#34;
Like I can&#39;t say yes and then be mad
that I said yes for the next 365 days.
