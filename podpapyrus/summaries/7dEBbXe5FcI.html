<li>Michael Jackson was extremely famous at the time, appearing in National Inquirer daily with Bubbles the chimp</li>
<li>Despite his massive fame, Michael was gentle, polite, and respectful to everyone on the team</li>
<li>This was after the "Bad" album and Michael was considered the most famous person in the world</li>
<li>The first meeting happened at Record One studio in Los Angeles in Sid's room</li>
<li>When recording vocals, Michael's performance was absolutely incredible and unbelievable</li>
<li>They had about 15 track ideas prepared before starting, created in New York with Teddy</li>
<li>The song "Remember the Time" was one Michael particularly loved from these tracks</li>
<li>In the early 90s, it was common practice to record one chorus and fly it in to other sections</li>
<li>Engineers used different methods like samplers (S1100), tape machines with offsets, or MIDI triggers</li>
<li>Michael didn't understand the concept of recording just one chorus to copy</li>
<li>Instead of one chorus, Michael sang the entire song from start to finish multiple times</li>
<li>His performance was perfect - second chorus identical, third chorus slightly different but flawless</li>
<li>The vocal doubles were spot-on perfect with perfect breath timing, intonation, and pocket</li>
<li>They completed 6-8 harmony tracks for all choruses in just 20 minutes</li>
<li>This approach was faster than traditional offset and tape machine calculations</li>
<li>The reason other artists didn't do this was because not everyone could be perfect like Michael Jackson</li>
<li>Michael insisted on keeping natural sounds like breathing, stomping, and clapping as part of the beat</li>
<li>Previous engineers had tried to clean up these natural sounds, but Michael wanted them preserved</li>

yeah Michael was just actually great
what totally surprised me first of all
first time I met him I&#39;d gone to the
studio we had just flown out from New
York went to we were working at record
one in Los Angeles Sid&#39;s room yeah so I
went there the night before to just kind
of check it out and get a lay of the
land before we started and I&#39;m just in
the room by myself and all of a sudden
the door opens up and it&#39;s Michael and
it&#39;s just me and him in the room I was
like oh my God that&#39;s Michael Jackson hi
Michael my name&#39;s Dave at that point
working he was the most famous person in
the world this is after uh bad was the
album preceding this one that we were
working on so yeah this is like when you
know bubbles the chimp and him were in
National inquire every day what the
Man all kind the level of Fame that is
kind of more common now but it was
certainly nothing you never seen
anything like it at that point but he
was so great so just gentle and polite
and and and respectful of everybody who
was working on the team it was great and
then on top of it you know when you
actually put a mic in front of him and
you know record his vocal I mean it was
just unbelievable that the first time I
recorded him we had this track that we
we Teddy and uh Teddy had kind of and I
had sat in the studio in New York and
came up with all these basically just
tracks for ideas to get things rolling
you know so we had about 15 songs that
were just there weren&#39;t songs yet just
tracks and there was one that a couple
that Michael just loved and so we
started on this one he said I have an
idea for the chorus let&#39;s do the vocals
so and it was this song called Remember
the Time and so all we had was the track
recorded and he wanted to do this chorus
vocal and back in these this is like you
know early 90s and it was kind of common
to just when it came to chorus vocals
you flew them in from Chorus to chorus
so they were exactly the same you and
there were different ways of doing it
Teddy used to use a sampler an
s00 1100 and we would do a bounce of we&#39;
record one chorus bounce it and then fly
it in you I think just uh you know or
maybe with a midi trigger and then like
Ellen baby face would do it with with
offsets of of you know two tape machines
with simpy offsets and figure out eight
bars at 110 BPM is this many you know
minutes and seconds and so you need to
do it that way but anyway I was ready to
just record one chorus of chorus and uh
I said Michael you want me to just go to
the chorus or he you could just start at
the top okay so go to the top and we got
through the first chorus and I pressed
stop and he he said what why&#39;d you stop
I said oh well we&#39;re just getting the
chorus so you know and he didn&#39;t know
what I was talking I was like we&#39;re
going to fly him in and he&#39;s like
doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about he
goes no just go go again from the top
and just go to the end okay and I&#39;ll do
you know one track all the way through
and so yep goes all the way gets to the
second chorus and sings it perfectly and
then in the third chorus it&#39;s just a
little bit different maybe and then
double that and the the double is
absolutely spot-on perfect like all the
breaths are perfectly in time and the
intonation is perfect and the pocket is
perfect everything about it so you know
we go through in about 20 minutes the
whole song and do you know six eight
nine tracks or whatever of of harmonies
for the choruses and we&#39;re done and it
sounds amazing yeah and I was like why
don&#39;t we do this all the time why do we
spend all this time with offsets and
tape machines and figuring out the math
and I was going to say that was faster
than you did but but the the you know
the main reason the answer to that was
that because not everybody&#39;s Michael
Jackson and make it gonna just be
perfect the first time you know so yeah
and the other thing he always said was
like don&#39;t don&#39;t erase the breaths right
or or this he always like you he would
do all this stomping and and clapping
and just noise that was a natural part
of the beat you know I guess at some
point prior Engineers had tried to clean
that stuff up and you know and he
realized no no no no no we don&#39;t want
that yeah so we made sure to keep all
