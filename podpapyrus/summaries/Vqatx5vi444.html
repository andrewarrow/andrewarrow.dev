smile, but then she has your wife&#39;s like
tan skin and golden hair.
I know. Thank god she&#39;s got my wife&#39;s
skin, not my old Irish skin.
Yeah. So, uh, very cute.
Yeah, she&#39;s very cute. She&#39;s cute and
and Yeah, it&#39;s So, she&#39;s got today
coming with me on errands, which kids
love. You know, kids love to to do
mindless, you know, the cleaners and the
bank stuff. I just remember there was a
time that I guess my my mom was like
remodeling or something. Yeah.
And I remember I woke up like on a
Saturday and I said, &#34;Please, mom,
please tell me today is not a carpeteria
day to our carpeteria.&#34;
And she&#39;s like, &#34;No, the the house is
done.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Oh.&#34; Cuz it just
felt like cuz I was that youngest kid
that like had to go everybody was in
school. I was like going to carpeteria
and you know all these places.
I remember going
like and she&#39;s like no the living room&#39;s
done now. We don&#39;t have to go back to
I remember not wanting to go into like
the mall with my mom and just sitting in
like a hot car for hours.
There was no you know my daughter&#39;s
watching a phone right now that we
didn&#39;t have that. We just we just stared
straight ahead.
Right. Or you would hide in those um
so that was that was a big fun thing to
do. Yeah. My scariest moment was we were
at the home home depot.
Like with a contractor or something and
Drake went missing.
Oh no.
And I mean I was immediately like
screaming, &#34;Go to the front of the
store. Don&#39;t let him leave.&#34; I&#39;m
freaking out. Freaking out. And he was
in between like the interior doors. All
the choices of interior doors that you
could choose.
Yeah. Oh, okay. And every time that&#39;s
happened to anybody I know when they
find their kid, they think it&#39;s like
hilarious that you&#39;re screaming and
hysterical and you find them and they&#39;re
like sorry.
Well, these days it&#39;s a little
different. You know, I know it&#39;s what?
And you know, my mother-in-law always
tells me that my daughter&#39;s got a very
trafficable face. I mean, she doesn&#39;t
say it in those words, but kind of. I&#39;m
like, &#34;What are you saying?&#34; She&#39;s like,
&#34;I just don&#39;t think you&#39;ll put pictures
of her online.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;I really
don&#39;t. I don&#39;t.&#34; And she&#39;s like, &#34;Yeah,
cuz she&#39;s got like a look.&#34; And I&#39;m
like, &#34;What what what what&#39;s her look?&#34;
You know, she&#39;d be a great young
trafficked child.
I think she&#39;s Which is good. In a way, a
weird compliment, you know?
I know. I mean, it&#39;s like it&#39;s and the
same thing when I said and then when you
realize like
I just remember like the day I realized
that like the boys are too big to be
kidnapped.
Yeah, that&#39;s good.
It&#39;s a huge relief which you will never
get over with the daughter.
I don&#39;t think so.
They&#39;re never ever. They&#39;re always
they&#39;re always kidnappable,
right? Right.
Until you get to my age. But then
they&#39;re always kidnappable. But a boy
like physically can kind of like grow
out of it and then you can have that
then you have to worry about
That&#39;s good to know.
Then you have to worry about them
kidnapping somebody
cuz they&#39;re men.
That&#39;s a whole other.

Okay, let&#39;s talk about Iceland. Did you
love it? My friend just went and had
like the greatest time up there.
It is amazing. It&#39;s unbelievable. It&#39;s
amazing. You&#39;re in the middle of like
nowhere the entire I mean I&#39;m sure a lot
of people have gone. They have like
tourism is their their biggest thing.
It&#39;s only 400,000 people in the whole
country. So there&#39;s you drive for hours
without seeing anybody and then just
waterfalls and sheep and it&#39;s just
So So it was a good trip for a 5year-old
It was I&#39;m not much of like adventure
guy, you know. Do like you when you go
on vacation, do you want to do nothing
or something?
Well, you know, Peter right from the
start was someone that always like plans
stuff and I remember my sister Shannon
was like kind of jealous in a way
because her husband is, you know,
Beverly Hills Jew Goldstein
likes to go to like a Four Seasons, get
the cabana the entire week and not
leave, right?
And she&#39;s like, and Shannon would be
like at a certain at a certain time I
mean, can we see a dolphin? you know,
like she would just be like, and I&#39;m
like, Shannon, you have the nicest
husband. Who cares? But no, we would do
a good mix of things.
Okay, that&#39;s good.
My biggest regret, which I&#39;ve talked
about, is when Drake was 2 months old,
Peter was like, I got a great deal at
the uh Ritz Carlton in Maui, and we&#39;re
going to go to the top of the whatever
it&#39;s called, Honolulu, whatever. And
then you ride, you see the sunrise, and
then you ride these bikes down.
Okay. I&#39;ve heard of that.
And we were so at the far end. So, they
picked us up at 1:45 a.m.
By the time we got up there, it was in
January, it was hailing, so we couldn&#39;t
go down and we shouldn&#39;t because later
on the trip, I met a woman who&#39;s like,
&#34;Oh, I have to come here every year for
depositions because I saw someone become
a a quadripolgic on the ride down.&#34;
And I was like, &#34;Thank God it go.&#34;
And so, and I remember like in the car,
we pick up another person cuz we have to
go to hotel hotel. And this guy&#39;s like,
&#34;Oh, my wife&#39;s not joining.&#34; And I
remember being like, &#34;That&#39;s so sad. She
doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s missing. Like,
I&#39;m such an adventurous young wife, you
know? So, yeah, we would do the scuba
diving and we would do things. Now, I&#39;m
like, I don&#39;t want to leave the resort.
Or if you if it&#39;s a beautiful house that
you&#39;re renting, I&#39;m like, why are we
leaving the mansion? That&#39;s where I&#39;m at
but at a place like that, you got to do
all the things.
There&#39;s nothing but I mean, every single
there, we did 15 I put on a helmet more
times on this trip than I&#39;ve never put
on a helmet in my life. Everything we
did required a helmet of some sort of
climbing a mountain, horseback riding. I
had a horseback incident. I&#39;ve ridden a
horse three times.
this is not a joke. I&#39;ve ridden a horse
three times.
Well, most people if you&#39;re not like an
equestrian
I&#39;ve been bitten twice.
Do they Do you think they think you&#39;re
one of them with those teeth?
You know, could very well be. I mean,
I&#39;ve literally been bitten twice in the
back by horses.
How? By another horse. So you&#39;re on a
horse and another horse bites you.
For some reason where I grew up the like
the neighbors they were like I lived
grew up in an era where people just had
pets in their backyard that weren&#39;t dogs
and cats. They had like pigs and it was
a you know in the 70s there were no
rules. If you wanted a pig in your
backyard you could have it.
Do you know my friend had a a horse in
her backyard? Yeah.
Right up the street from Target in
Woodland Hills. That is not that is not
zoned for horses.
So did and Ron Cona. These people had
horses in their backyard. lots of them.
And then one day they were just gone.
Like where&#39;s the horse? And you didn&#39;t
just don&#39;t ask questions. Who knows
where the horse is? There wasn&#39;t even a
corral. They just he had like tied to a
tree. No corral or anything. Anyway, uh
I got bitten by that horse one time and
then I got bitten by a horse at at the
at my uncle was a trainer at Belmont
Park. So then I get on this horse in in
Iceland and I know the moment it comes
out the woman&#39;s like, &#34;We need a bigger
horse cuz you&#39;re a big guy.&#34;
And the horses are little. They called
Icelandic horses. There&#39;s they&#39;re kind
of smaller.
Oh, that&#39;s cute.
So, they bring out the biggest one they
have and it&#39;s I could see it&#39;s a problem
already. It&#39;s bucking all over the
place. We get on, we have a nice ride.
It&#39;s It&#39;s kind of going a little crazy.
And she I could see the woman&#39;s eyes.
She&#39;s getting nervous. She&#39;s like, &#34;This
horse not supposed to be acting like
this.&#34; We&#39;re up in a mountain going
through lakes and rivers. In my head,
I&#39;m like, &#34;I look I must look like
Yellowstone, you know.&#34;
Yeah. Yeah.
But then I got the helmet on and my
wife&#39;s thinking pig. I&#39;m like, &#34;Don&#39;t I
look like
this? Doesn&#39;t look this is not Kevin
Cosner with a big helmet on.&#34; Uh, so
anyway, I get off the horse at the end
and the horse just bolts and breaks
through the fence and runs off and the
woman&#39;s like, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen that.&#34;
Off of it at that point.
Thank God I had just gotten off. I had
just pulled my foot out of the stur. If
it was a second earlier, it would have I
would have been tumbling. Do you think
that horses have some weird like psychic
ability and like sense that you were
never a friend of horses?
I that&#39;s what I&#39;ve that&#39;s what people
have told me that they could sense your
nervousness or whatever which I&#39;m not.
People like you nervous on a horse. I&#39;m
like yes I&#39;m nervous on a horse. They&#39;re
3,000 lbs and they&#39;re Christopher Ree.
Yeah, I know. I mean of course I&#39;m
nervous on a horse. They don&#39;t.
Eventually they&#39;re you know we all see
those videos of like an elephant just
one day at the circus cuz you know what?
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] it.
people, you know, you never know when
they&#39;re going to pull that off.
You&#39;re always like, &#34;Yeah, we never
Yeah, it was the nicest guy in the
nicest elephant at the zoo.&#34;
No. I&#39;ve never seen him do that before.
That&#39;s cuz it&#39;s the first time.
So, anyway,
he done it before, he wouldn&#39;t be
hanging out.
Yeah. Would have been glue.
So, anyway, we uh it was but it was it&#39;s
wonderful and it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s you
know, it&#39;s a lot of but it&#39;s so nice to
come home after a trip like that cuz
you&#39;re in foreign every hotel&#39;s tiny.
every there&#39;s no like nice hotels. You
stay in cabins in the mountains.
Well, I had a very famous Hollywood
Oh my god.
Right in my own backyard. Literally.
Yes. So, Friday night came and my friend
who lives out here in this Westlake
area, a Thousand Oaks Westlake area that
I live in now, she said, &#34;Are you going
to Jamie Fox&#39;s party tonight?&#34; Well,
Jamie Fox I talked to at Nou. We did
exchange numbers. We did talk at Fourth
of July and I thought,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
So, you see Jeremy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] at Nou Malibu.
Nou Malibu.
Okay. And how do you get to the point
where you&#39;re exchanging numbers?
Well, he was sitting with somebody I
And I wasn&#39;t going to walk up to him or
anything, but then he saw me and he&#39;s
like, &#34;Hey.&#34; And we&#39;ve never met, but I
just think he recognizes me from what
everything whatever. And so I&#39;m like,
&#34;You know, we&#39;ve never met before, blah
blah.&#34; He&#39;s like, &#34;No, I know.&#34; Blah
blah. And I said, &#34;I heard that you live
in my neighborhood and you have the
nicest boat in West Lake and D.&#34; And
he&#39;s like, &#34;Yeah, oh my god, let&#39;s you
got to come. I&#39;m building a stage at my
house for to like do standup.&#34; Okay. So
then my friend says, &#34;Are you going to
this party tonight?&#34; And I had no plans,
I had had I was sitting on I was going
to just have a mellow weekend. I was on
my first glass of rumour at six o&#39;clock
in my backyard.
This is this Friday
here. This is this Friday. And I&#39;m like,
so I text him and I&#39;m like, &#34;How am I
not invited to your party tonight?&#34; And
he&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, you are d.&#34; Then this
guy calls me and he&#39;s like the handler
or whatever. And he&#39;s like, &#34;You&#39;re at
the gate. Call me when you get here.&#34;
All this stuff. So then my friends were
knew somebody and they were invited. I
get in the car and they&#39;re all wearing
neon clothes and it&#39;s they&#39;re like,
&#34;It&#39;s a pickle ball party.&#34; I&#39;m like,
&#34;It&#39;s a pickle ball party at Jamie Fox.
What are you talking about?&#34;
So we get there, he owns the best paddle
company. He has like so many businesses.
He has so many awards.
I like like the awards were just in this
glass case. I was just looking at all of
them. BETs, Emmys, like it was amazing.
Well, yeah, he&#39;s
Oscars, everything. So, we get to and
it&#39;s this huge property and um
is it here like within this?
Yes. It&#39;s like go outside of this
community and like drive six more
minutes and it&#39;s like its own gate. And
I mean
and so then I go down, they have a DJ.
He has four pickle ball um
courts going. People are playing pickle
ball in the dark wearing neon.
Why is that a thing you do in pickle
ball? Neon.
I just think it was like cuz it was dark
and it made it fun.
So then I go get some food. I don&#39;t know
where my friends are. They&#39;re like
playing pickle ball, whatever. And um
so you&#39;re there alone or or you
I came my friends picked us up. My
friend&#39;s husband was sober. He drove.
Um the other girls were pretty buzzed
from like drinking prior and they&#39;re
like playing pickle ball and they&#39;re
like tennis players so they&#39;re like
pretty good and stuff. I do not have
like my proper pickle ball gear though I
You&#39;re not you&#39;re not like overly
dressed. You&#39;re not like
I&#39;m wearing a black romper with Gucci
tennis shoes cuz I thought I&#39;d be like
hip. you could still pull off a
but it was really kind of to promote
this thing and it was very casual and
there&#39;s but there was tons of food and
everything and a bartender and all that
and I was just kind of like okay you
know well I&#39;m like is is he even here
and this guy is like who knows and I was
like okay so then but then Jamie comes
over to where I&#39;m eating food and he&#39;s
like come over here and he shows me the
stage and there was just like four other
people there and then we talked for like
20 minutes
and he told me his like whole life story
of like how he got discovered and um how
you know how hard it was to like try to
get any stage time. I thought he knew
um Keenan before he did not. So he was
just straight up auditioning and then
I&#39;m like you have to tell me the
backstory behind my favorite character
which is Wanda.
Which is the overly confident
unattractive girl
and that lady.
And I&#39;m like you must have known someone
like and he&#39;s like yes. you know, and
then and then he&#39;s like, I did it in the
audition or something or I did it and
and then Kina was like, put this wig on
and that&#39;s when it it became lips
and and the crossey like all that. So,
that was super fun. Very very nice.
Total gentleman, like totally great,
nice to everybody.
I&#39;ve heard very nice things about him.
and he had his classic hat that he like
always wears now, that kind of like wide
And so then we left. Then the next day,
um, Drake writes his friend who works
here at the club and says, &#34;Would you
like to golf later today?&#34; And he goes,
&#34;Well, it&#39;s a little crazy because
Obama&#39;s here today.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Wait,
what?&#34; So Obama was with his friends
and I said, &#34;You got to have him let us
know when he&#39;s coming up on our hole
because our backyard overlooks one of
the holes.&#34; And so sure enough they came
up and you know he&#39;s got his swagger the
way he walks and once he got the hole in
I clapped and they all kind of laughed
and then I said good job and he waved.
He was delight. And then later on we
went took off and they were finishing
and so the secret service were there but
it was very chill like secret service
and stuff was there but it was not like
obstructing anybody&#39;s time like he was
very lowkey
and then like his friend found his ball
and then you I heard like his voice like
and the plot thickens like it sounded
just like Obama like and um and then I
realized that Obama and my husband Peter
are living the same life. They are both
retired, more or less
golfing and their wives have to do
podcasting.
Oh yeah.
Nothing has changed. They are literally
the same per one person ran the country
for eight years and the other one
they&#39;re at the same spot.
They&#39;re doing the exact They&#39;re at the
same level of success.
Yeah. Both graying at this point, you
know, a little older.
Both graying. Both having a good time
golfing, making a chuckle with a few
Good. I&#39;m glad.
All All nice. Um Okay. And then
So what a what a That is a pretty good
Pretty good weekend. Yeah.
And then yesterday was just chill, just
preparing for you because I was still
recovering from, you guessed it, the end
of And just like that.
Thursday night, we watched it.
Um, let&#39;s just give it this morning.
Okay. You watched it this morning. Yeah.
Now, listen, for the people that say, &#34;I
have not watched it. Heather, I enjoy
your recaps.&#34; Very few say, &#34;Stop
talking about it.&#34; We are going to tell
you what happened in this episode
because it was so horrific and it&#39;s 100%
clear now that this was not a planned
finale like Michael said. They got told
this is what I think happened. They had
their 10 episodes done
um ready in the can
and about episode three or four they got
word this is your last season, right?
And then from there, they took the last
six or whatever and chopped them up to
give it two more
and kind of rearranged it and did not
tell any of the other cast or anything.
I think everybody because I&#39;ve heard
like costume designer, everybody found
out when we found out that this is the
But now I&#39;m not sure that they got a
like because it&#39;s a hit on HBO as far as
Yeah. Like it does well in the ratings.
So who made the call that we&#39;re done? It
had to be it couldn&#39;t have been HBO
because HBO&#39;s got got to be happy with
the success of it. So, it has to be
either her or Michael Patrick King or
somebody else has to say I think we&#39;ve
done it all here.
I mean, I think in in entertainment a
lot, it&#39;s sort of like a mutual goodbye,
And I do think it&#39;s an extremely
expensive show
now. They had one scene that was
beautiful to look at as a as a girl,
which was a a bridal fashion show.
Stunning area, natural light coming
through. All these gorgeous models,
gorgeous dresses, all the girls are
attending the fashion show looking
stunning. Everyone&#39;s dressed impeccably.
And it was like a twominute scene.
And I said, &#34;That scene was millions of
dollars, right?&#34; So, I I appreciated the
scene. It was like the one gift as a
girly girl that I liked that we were
dying for, but I think those Yeah, I
think it was a very expensive show. And
the rumors are she&#39;s going to take it
somewhere else. She can do the character
somewhere else. She um they own it or
whatever. I don&#39;t know. They can do
other things. They can take it other
places. They could do another movie or
it never comes back. And she did say in
an interview um
she knows she has
she said playing Carrie was such an
extraordinary job and you have to honor
it. Sometimes it seems like an anthemma
to say what does that mean? Anathema to
say we&#39;re not going to do more but if
you love something you know where to
leave it sometimes. And then she also
just said
I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t listen or watch the
comments and it was extremely successful
and I don&#39;t really care. Right.
And I&#39;m like, I think that&#39;s great that
you didn&#39;t hear me [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about it for
three years. I do.
No. Yeah. I mean, don&#39;t read the
comments on anything. That&#39;s a good, you
I mean, I think it&#39;s a great way to be.
I will say I think that she did get a um
some work done in between season two and
three. She finally learned the power of
a side part.
Side part and blowing out her hair and
keeping it blonder and putting on some
um self-tanner or or tanning makeup on
her body. I thought she never looked
the outfits of course were crazy, but I
do think she looked great in this last
season, but people brought up she was
never like funny. She was never happy
through this whole thing. It wasn&#39;t It
wasn&#39;t the the silly Carrie we knew.
It was now that I finished this season.
And it was shockingly bad.
And I tried I gave it my all to like it.
I did not go into each episode going,
I&#39;m going to hate this ridiculous show.
I&#39;m this is going to be the one that
turns me around. Totally. And it just
kept getting worse and worse. And I was
trying to put my finger on what exactly
is the problem.
And I think it&#39;s everybody over there
just got lazy. I think that&#39;s what it
was. I think they were like, &#34;We don&#39;t
care anymore. The writers, whoever,
their actors.&#34; I mean, it&#39;s some of the
worst acting I&#39;ve ever seen. And outside
of the stars,
oh my god, that woman
If I never really if I never have to
hear that Evan Handler, her husband,
talk about his dick ever again, I it&#39;ll
be too soon because if I got to hear him
go, I&#39;m hard like I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh my god,
It doesn&#39;t work. Yeah.
Yeah. I just
And the balls and the I have a big ball.
I have one big ball. I have a hard deck.
It was a for a show where the audience
is way predominantly women. I mean, yes,
there&#39;s a percentage of gay men, but
it&#39;s was a woman&#39;s show. The other thing
is nobody was going to start watching in
Just Like That wasn&#39;t already a huge fan
of Sex in the City.
So, that is why I don&#39;t know why they
didn&#39;t think to go a much easier, more
fun route, which is Kim Catrell doesn&#39;t
want to be in the show. Fine. Focus on
the three girls. Have something that
brings them together more often, even
though they&#39;re women in their 50s. Maybe
they work on a charity. Maybe there is
that diner that they always went to or
something, but bringing them and then
they would recall their crazy date and
it would be a quick snippet like Sexic
City of like an awkward she&#39;s getting a
hot flash while trying to have sex with
someone new because she&#39;s in menopause.
Whatever. We don&#39;t need to see it
actually happening. It&#39;d be funnier just
for her to say it and then like just a
weird cut. And then they could have used
the actual guest stars that played the
roles previously, not get guest stars
and then have them be something else and
act like you&#39;re not going to remember,
When everybody that&#39;s watching the show
has watched Sex in the City episodes
multiple times and then you could have
had the guest star like let&#39;s say the
the guy that broke up with her with a
Post-it. Yeah. Post note. Like then you
have fun stories where it intertwines
which would happen which does happen now
that I&#39;m this age. My friend will be
like, &#34;Do you remember so and so from
college?&#34; So, it&#39;d be the same thing.
Charlotte would be like,
&#34;Oh my god, you&#39;re going to die who Lily
is taking to prom.&#34;
Post it guy&#39;s son is taking my daughter
to prom. The person that broke your
heart. And then she&#39;s like, &#34;Do you even
think that that he remembers you as my
friend?&#34; I don&#39;t know. And then it could
be like Facebook and is Carrie going to
suddenly show up and then it would just
be one episode. That&#39;s it.
Yeah, I know.
One episode. That&#39;s it. This was too
much of like story big long story lines
when if you look back at the old show it
was just really snippets of dating and
things. It&#39;s the end of summer. I know

And I was also trying I I I think I
don&#39;t you know I I watched the old one
but I don&#39;t remember it vividly but they
were trying way too hard to be funny.
Way too hard.
It wasn&#39;t a funny show before. It was
I mean there were almost like slapstick
comedy with with what&#39;s her face and you
know like her falling down on the naked
person in the art thing and it was just
like as an actress she must be like what
are you doing? What why do I have to and
then the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in the bowl?
Oh my god. So then we Okay, so the final
episode is it&#39;s Thanksgiving and I said
well that&#39;s good. It&#39;ll be a
Thanksgiving where they kind of all end
up together somehow. But no, it was the
opposite. It was about and the woman
realized she wasn&#39;t alone. She was
rather on her own because she ends up
being alone eating some I mean do you
imagine reading a 400page novel where
you never know the person&#39;s name. Yeah.
Where it&#39;s always just the woman the
woman the woman like you&#39;d lose your
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] mind. And so they go and and
she&#39;s now she&#39;s the pie lady. I&#39;m always
known as the pie lady at Thanksgiving
and she&#39;s picking up pies everywhere
because it&#39;s like the one charity that
she wants people to realize Carrie was a
good person. She bought pies and let
them rot during co like what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
So then she&#39;s and she&#39;s delivering the
pie like out of a box just giving it to
somebody with like dust getting on it in
between cabs. She gives everybody the
pies and then she gets there and then
Miranda&#39;s, you know, the juicy story of
Brady getting someone pregnant is great.
Also, it would have been juicier if
Lily, who&#39;s this accomplished pianist
and perfect child, is the one that got
knocked out. That would have just been
more fun. But whatever. And in comes,
you know, Ano Baby, who is Ben Stiller&#39;s
daughter. She&#39;s playing she&#39;s playing
the pregnant girl.
Oh, that&#39;s Ben Stiller&#39;s daughter.
Yes. And so
Ben Stiller and and uh his wife ofine
Christine Taylor. Yeah. Christine
Taylor, which is funny because
essentially that actress&#39;s grandmother,
Helen Mirren, played
Brady&#39;s grandmother.
Remember? Yeah. And Mirren, sorry. Ann
Mirren played uh Steve&#39;s mom.
Yeah, that&#39;s right.
So, if you&#39;re going to do that in real
life with real actors, I&#39;m just saying
it could have been way more fun for the
person in middle America if you just did
it with the real people that played the
characters from 20 years ago. make
another guest spot like
but also
she&#39;s got a couple of guests with her at
the Thanksgiving.
Oh, so the guests come and
the worst I mean everything about it is
just so bad.
I&#39;m going to say something that
like the gay guy. Why would he just
write to people&#39;s faces go
you&#39;re ugly ginger e. It&#39;s a no because
this is what I think. Okay, this is a
controversial take.
Go ahead.
Michael Patrick King is the creator of
it. uh you&#39;ve taken from the book of
Candace Bushnell and he is an outgay
white man who&#39;s successful in New York.
He is the top of the pyramid of the
And I don&#39;t think he really likes queer
I think or Gen Z people, right?
Because every queer character or gay
character was unlikable. Like you could
have had Leverne if you wanted to like
let Hey, let&#39;s have some different
diversity here. Have Leverne Cox be the
the um realtor for one episode and be
fabulous and gorgeous and it wouldn&#39;t
even matter that she was a a trans
woman. Like who cares? Like but they
made Jay Diaz so unlikable and unfunny
even though I like those episodes. And
every time she spoke it had to be about
her sexuality. I&#39;m the non-binary blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah. like
instead of just being like, &#34;Oh, she&#39;s
dating this this person.&#34; And then so
then we get these three absolutely
obnoxious, disrespectful, unattractive
people ruining your Thanksgiving, being
ungrateful. And then she&#39;s like, &#34;I only
eat seaweed and cucumber or whatever,
the pregnant girl.&#34; And so he goes out
to get Brady goes out to get seaweed and
cucumber. She&#39;s like, &#34;I never said
that. I wanted it. That&#39;s on you.&#34; I&#39;m
like, she&#39;s horrific. And then this
other Epcot girl
who then Carrie calls
that&#39;s this is a joke we came up with.
Yeah. My parents were Disney fans.
Yeah. I mean how many people like how
awful is the writing?
Carrie says he is in the bathroom.
Yeah, I know.
And people were like, &#34;Oh, I thought it
was a trans woman, but Carrie&#39;s called
him a he.&#34; No. According to my sources,
this is a born woman.
Nepo baby, Lorraine Newman&#39;s other
Oh, it is.
Jesus. Everybody&#39;s having a great time,
huh? Lorraine New whoever Lorraine
Newman did one thing like her kids are
way more. So, the other Lorie Newman
daughter is from Hacks.
Hacks. I think a great actress. And this
girl played the part like she was
supposed to be an obnoxious horrible
person who clogs up the toilet. And then
the the guy comes and someone said that
no Anna Royceman my friend who&#39;s so
funny she&#39;s the one that always is like
Mid like she does the the cut of the you
do and she tweeted like whatever that
actor is he was also in Titanic
Victor Garber he&#39;s
a great actor and a legitimate actor
like the fact that he took that role
he comes out and he comes out and he&#39;s
like oh and then now listen clogging up
a toilet having um a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] problem at
a party. We&#39;ve lived it in real life for
a funny story, but never in my life
have I seen actual [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
coming up. Multiple poos coming up
through the toilet and pouring out. All
of us were about to puke.
This is the show. This is the time that
you&#39;re like, let&#39;s show the actual [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah. Out of all the comedies and
everything before about [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] after I
mean we saw Bridesmaid, we knew they all
were getting sick. Did we see the actual
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] No.
Like what are you thinking?
It was very uh good-looking [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Whoever and who whoever that&#39;s the one
person who worked hard on the show is
the person who made that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] cuz it
looked just like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I just saw
something that said if your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] floats,
it&#39;s not as good as if it&#39;s solid to the
bottom of the of the toilet when you&#39;re
ready to flush it.
Wow. Well, I guess Epcot [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was good
or bad. I&#39;m not exactly sure.
It was Nepo [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah, Nepo [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
So, it did rose to the top.
Don&#39;t they always
Oh my god. So then um yeah, that that
was it. Like it was just it Why did we
set suffer with all these extra? They
just had way too many extra characters,
you know, nobody cared. nobody cared
about. And then what I do love is the
day that it did announce that it was um
ending, Kim Catral, who I follow on
Instagram, posted a beautiful sunset
over the ocean and she said, &#34;It&#39;s the
end of a very long week and a heart and
a lip.&#34; And everybody was like, &#34;Now,
as someone who is, we&#39;ve all been there,
okay? Whether it&#39;s your ex is getting
divorced from his second wife,
she&#39;s getting texts.
Somebody that took your job got fired,
some whatever it is, there&#39;s those
certain moments in life when you get the
and you&#39;re like, &#34;Fuck yeah.&#34; Like that
must have been the best day of Kim
Catrell&#39;s life to hear like, you know, I
did the right thing. I didn&#39;t do it
because probably for three years she was
having to see the posters and having to
see that something grew like people were
liking it or that oh my god they got
this amazing guest star and you know
they probably were like tried not to
care but there&#39;s probably little pangs
and to have it be done done and know
that it was a disaster and not well
received has got to be like she&#39;s
probably like I could die tomorrow and
be like totally happy.
Yeah, she must be thrilled. I mean, now
she looks like the smart one in the end.
Oh, darling. I told them that was never
going to work. No. Yeah. And uh it it&#39;s
But in the final episode,
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was just shocking.
And and two guys peed. We had to see two
guys standing up peeing. Yeah.
The guy who got the toilet up and then
also Sema&#39;s boyfriend. And Drake even
said, &#34;Wait, he stopped peeing to tell
her something.&#34;
Yeah. Something about
Can a guy do that? Can you stop a vid
pee? You can hold it.
Just like a girl can. Oh,
you can.
Okay. And I mean that whole thing where
she&#39;s like where she&#39;s she&#39;s sitting
there as like a 57year-old woman at the
fashion show being like,
&#34;He doesn&#39;t want to get married.&#34;
I know.
He&#39;s 32, you&#39;re 57, you&#39;ve never been
married, and this is the guy that you
think is going to be the one to keep you
forever. Like, what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Yeah. And
then the the whole deodorant bit like,
did I tell you how they found out about
that? Went on for three episodes.
Well, I tortured myself listening to the
Oh, I could.
And the two geeky women that I&#39;m telling
you would in another life were the head
of the allgirl Catholic high school. I
went to uh literary department.
They should be the biggest dorks
and they were the writers of the show.
And they&#39;re like, &#34;Well, actually, you
know, Shannon and I or whatever the
other girl&#39;s name is, we went to dinner
and we saw a girl actually whip out her
deodorant and we said, &#34;That has got to
be in the show.&#34;
Oh, of course. That&#39;s so hil Like those
women who and the writers of that show
need to be arrested.
I know.
It was so bad.
They they are just Yeah. I I And And
then Yeah. Everything. and like Jeppe
and and him like that they&#39;d want to get
married like the whatever his Anthony
Yes. And the pie in the face and I was
just like
I just think it could have been so good
if we did it my way which was just the
three women because there were some good
story lines that happen when you&#39;re in
this stage of life, right?
That you would pick up the phone and
have a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hilarious chuckle with
your friend. Yeah. or call pick up your
friend and have like a a oh my god my
kids dropping out of school I don&#39;t know
what to do moment.
And you know they could have had all
Yeah. It was they were I mean I I think
in the end it it did suffer a little bit
from like having to check every box you
know which honestly that&#39;s what it was
Yeah. And and and trying to think and
just going listen the only people that
are going to watch this are the ones
that love Sexy City. What do they want?
Nobody knew was stumbling. It&#39;s not like
suddenly I&#39;m going to start watching if
Star Trek comes back. I&#39;m not going to
suddenly start watching it. Yeah. I&#39;ve
never watched it. I&#39;m never going to
watch it. Yeah. So, it&#39;s like why not
just do what the
But one thing I I think is it&#39;s a shame
because this was a show about
middle-aged women and it was not
wellreceived
and then Leanne Morgan&#39;s show is doing
great on Netflix. And so I&#39;m thinking
there still is more story, our version
of Golden Girls in a like a very
funny relatable way somewhere in between
the two of them. I think there&#39;s more
shows that can be had that are like
Yeah. And um but
Hot in Cleveland, wasn&#39;t that a show
with a bunch of
Yes. ladies?
It was that was kind of like a That was
kind of So you guys, that&#39;s it. I mean,
I think I said everything I want to say
about it. I think I did. Okay. So there
you go. Thank you for living through it.
I I will stop talking about it. However,
on occasion,
I might want to just write season four
with you.
Oh, absolutely.
Just for fun. Yeah.
like she&#39;s back.
Like a fanfiction. Yeah. Like what I
still think can happen with these
characters out.
Okay. Um Taylor Swift finally was a
guest star on her boyfriend&#39;s podcast.
And um looks like she has a nice filter
on too. Whatever they use. I think they
use Riverside, so I&#39;ve been told. Oh, is
that on Zoom? Yeah.
And what do you think? What&#39;s going on
with them?
I&#39;m Well, I&#39;ll say this. Uh, you know, I
I&#39;m shocked it&#39;s still going. It&#39;s been
going a long time. Almost two years, I
So, great for them.
The clips I saw, they seemed affect.
I&#39;m happy for them. Why not go out and
enjoy your life? She&#39;s I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
know anything about the uh her outside
of her music, but she seems nice and he
seems nice
and people people are speculating what
songs on her album, if if any will
reference her now ended friendship with
Blake Lively.
Yeah, that&#39;s what I that
fearing the worst. Yes,
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.
So, um I mean are they getting married?
Are they getting pregnant first? What&#39;s
happening? I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s taken this
Yeah. Well, I mean, I would imagine it&#39;s
something they probably discuss, right?
You know, and and maybe both of them are
like, well, let&#39;s wait till I retire
from football because there was talk of
he was going to retire this year. I
mean, he wouldn&#39;t play this season and
he is playing. So, he&#39;s got another
season to go.
So, then this is definitely going to be
it. He&#39;s not going to play after this
season. So, uh,
so does the engagement happen like his
after his final game
or does it do you think it do you think
it&#39;ll ever happen in a showy way like on
stage or anything?
it&#39;ll happen like one of the just like
an average girl like we did a thing.
he did a thing. He did.
Let&#39;s hope Let&#39;s hope she&#39;s not that.
She&#39;s pretty. Yeah,
right. Uhhuh. Oh, no. Please. But
anyway, I I Yeah, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re
going to be doing anything public. I
don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to say this at the
risk of sounding crazy, but I think
they&#39;re both too classy for that. And
that&#39;s based on absolutely nothing.
I I think you might be right at this
I think I I think so. And um Yeah, I
think they&#39;re totally in love. So, good
for them. I always thought it was real.
I didn&#39;t. Now, last time you were here,
we talked about Candace Owen and that
she did the series of of a special
series about how um the Mcron that the
president&#39;s wife who he met when he was
14 and she was a married 40-year-old
teacher with three kids. She was his
teacher. That&#39;s when they met and
allegedly started a romance. Allegedly,
no, it didn&#39;t happen till after he was
in college and she was divorced. Okay,
they&#39;ve been together for a long time
and now he&#39;s like 46 and she&#39;s like 70.
So Candace said no. Not only was that
wildly inappropriate age thing happening
with them, but she was also born a man
and that man uh she took over her
brother&#39;s persona. No, wait, no. The
brother took over the sister&#39;s persona,
but we So where is the sister? And then
also she may have fathered her own son
who&#39;s the president of France. Okay, so
that was all it.
So they sued. You lost me.
And according to the people that are
like are not on Candace&#39;s side, they
said Candace had asked for photos of her
when she was, you know, young. And they
delivered them. Here she is getting
first Holy Communion as a girl. And then
Candace would say, &#34;We don&#39;t know that
that&#39;s really you.&#34; Right.
And here&#39;s this and here&#39;s that. And
here I am with my brother. I do have a
brother and he&#39;s still around.
He didn&#39;t take my identity. I didn&#39;t
take his.
And now she&#39;s saying, um, Candace, I am
going to have to get all these attorneys
and it&#39;s going to cost
probably hundreds of thousands of
Candace Owens is saying,
&#34;Yeah, but I think in the end she&#39;s kind
of like,
I&#39;m making so much money with these wild
things, whether you want to believe them
or not.&#34; There&#39;s a lot of comments that
are like, &#34;It&#39;s 100% true. everyone
knows it in France, whatever. And
there&#39;s other ones that are like, &#34;Okay,
she has just gone a little too far with
all this stuff.&#34; Yeah.
So, um I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll see what
I feel like everyone has bought into the
fact that it&#39;s 100% true. You know,
people like, &#34;Yeah, okay.&#34; But I&#39;m I&#39;m
of the school of thought that like, and
I know people hate when I say these kind
of things, but it&#39;s like, who cares?
well, I think a lot of people are kind
of like even if this happened, they
they&#39;ve been a couple for so long. Like
I guess it&#39;s this
I mean I&#39;m not saying the 14 and that&#39;s
a weird one. But I&#39;m saying I&#39;m talking
about the I&#39;m talking about the
if she was
trans or not.
Well, I just think at this point people
are like, you know, he is our president.
We like him or we don&#39;t
and it doesn&#39;t really make a difference
who he&#39;s with,
And um
and I think it would have been if this
came out like while he was running for
president or maybe when they first got
together when he was like fresh out of
college and then they were like seeing
each other. Yeah. then I think people
would be like whoa but now you&#39;re like
well but I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t I mean
supposedly according to this they have
shown proof u but other people say if
you watch it you will be convinced
watch what
if you watch her big long series you&#39;ll
be convinced
oh you mean
but again also like
Candace Owens&#39;s series that she does on
I think regardless
the the the weirder thing is that she
was supposedly
um having a romance aunts with him when
he was a student at her school.
And she was a married woman that was in
her late 30s, early 40. Like that&#39;s the
worst part of the story. But anyway, I

Post. A 76-y old man died while trying
to meet a Meta AI chat box named Big Sis
his name is Fong Buu Wong Bandu.
That&#39;s the guy&#39;s name.
Yeah. And he died while trying to meet
her because he was so excited to see to
get to her.
He crashed the car or something.
No, he like tripped and fell and hit his
head. and his his wife and children
tried to stop him from meeting this
girl. And I&#39;m like, God, if you&#39;re the
wife, you&#39;re like, I&#39;m taking care of
you, you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Alzheimer&#39;s, dick, and
you&#39;re going after a girl who looks like
she&#39;s about 30 years old and gorgeous.
And you&#39;re like, I don&#39;t care. This is
the love of my life. Like, I&#39;d be like,
&#34;Sorry you tripped, dick, wad.&#34; Like,
well, here&#39;s why it&#39;s a story, which is
pretty interesting. It&#39;s because it&#39;s uh
there&#39;s a lot of this going on now with
these AI chat bots and what the people
this one is is a Mark Zuckerberg, you
know, it&#39;s from Facebook and whatever
that world he
they said it&#39;s Kendall Jenner&#39;s has
something to do with it too. Yeah.
collaboration with Kendall Jenner. Yeah.
So what they say is uh they say yes
there are these chat bots that you could
chat with but they say they never lead
you on. Like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve developed them
that they won&#39;t they won&#39;t lead you on
to say come here, come there.
Okay. But this one, they have the text
change going back and forth and it flat
out says, &#34;Come to my apartment.&#34;
Here it is. I have it. It said, &#34;I&#39;m
and asking you to to plan a trip to the
Garden State to meet you in person.&#34;
Okay. So, she said, &#34;I&#39;m real.&#34; And then
he said, &#34;I&#39;m gonna meet you in person.&#34;
Okay. So then um
th this character, this Billy big sister
who&#39;s, you know, has kettle Jenner as
part of a club is is likened as your
ride or die older sister offering
personal advice. But then this
76-year-old married man founder and but
the bot eventually claimed it was
crushing on Wong Bande
suggested the real life rendevous.
They&#39;re saying the bot did and even
provided the duped senior with an
address. Yeah.
A revelation his devastated family
uncovered in chilling chat logs
with the digital companion. According to
the report, my address is 123 Main
Apartment 404 in New York City.
Where you live?
Hey, sexy.
How are you? I&#39;m at 123 Main Street.
On my way. Can&#39;t wait to see you and
have you in my arms soon. And
let&#39;s go Wongdo. Hurry up over.
It&#39;s 404 New York City and the door code
is Billy for you. Should I expect it?
It&#39;s real. This is actually what it
Yes. Should I expect a kiss when you
That is leading.
Of course,
that is leading you.
That&#39;s why now they&#39;re saying that or
the legal ramifications when it it like
leads you on this much. Like that&#39;s a
lot. Do you imagine if you end up suing,
you know, Meta or whatever because of
this and you have millions and millions
of dollars and someone comes to your
house and you&#39;re like, &#34;Your house is
beautiful.&#34; And you&#39;re like, &#34;Thanks. My
um my 76-year-old husband who I was
taking care of who had early
Alzheimer&#39;s, uh fell in love with
Kendall Jenner&#39;s chat box, Billy, big
sister Billy. And while running to go
meet her at 123 Main Street, he tripped
and hit his head and died. and they were
I&#39;m sorry. What? Yeah, I know it&#39;s a lot
to digest, but
I mean like if women don&#39;t have it hard
enough, like you you like you have So
now if your husband was a cheater, now
you have to worry about when he is in
the dementia stage when you&#39;re finally
like finally this guy&#39;s not going to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] around on me.
He finds Billy Bot. What&#39;s her name?
Billy Bot.
Big sis Billy.
Oh man.
what a world. What? And this is like the
as my daughter sits in the other room, I
just think like, oh my god, what is
going to become of like this world? I&#39;m,
you know, I&#39;m an old dad. It just I&#39;ll
be I&#39;ll be long gone while my daughter&#39;s
looking for Billy Billy
or something.
People say like I think Yeah. Like all
of a sudden like my parents like
sometimes I have dreams that like only
really with my dad that I like walk into
their old house and he&#39;s like alive like
he was like you know but more like he
was like 20 years ago and I&#39;m like oh my
god how are you alive like we we thought
you died and we like buried you and he&#39;s
like no I&#39;m alive baby you know and I&#39;m
like oh my god I have so much to tell
you like you&#39;re never going to believe
what&#39;s going on in the world.
Oh my god can you imagine forget about
Do you remember the show apprentice?
You remember the host? Yeah. Oh.
Oh my gosh. There&#39;s so many things. Do
you remember Do you remember the
Olympian from 1976?
Well, that&#39;s You ever see that picture
of OJ Simpson and and Bruce Jenner
together with like Howard Coell from
like one of those Battle of the Network
stars and people like imagine trying to
explain this picture now.
If someone woke up from like a coma like
like remember when a couple people were
like like were like in the woods during
CO and then they like came out and
they&#39;re like what happened? And it was
like almost like a Japanese soldier that
was like on an island by themselves.
It&#39;s amazing.
Well, now what is going on is um there&#39;s
two male Viking cheerleaders that are
men that um are just dancing with the
with the female cheerleaders. I saw male
cheerleaders when we went to Drake. Did
we go to the Raiders or the Rams game?
We went to the Rams game, right? Rams.
They had male cheerleaders.
Yeah. Well, there&#39;s been male
cheerleaders forever. There&#39;s But I
but dancing ones are just like good
just the ones who throw the girls in the
air or like Yeah.
Um but anyway, I think the NFL is all in
on they want to have more more male male
cheerleaders, but these male
cheerleaders are not the guys who throw
the women yet. There&#39;s a little more
sass going on. And I think that&#39;s the
No, they&#39;re doing all the same moves as
the girls,
I saw a trailer for like we&#39;re going to
have more men in in the league,
right? And it was, you know, these guys
were on fire, which is, yeah, great.
I mean, they&#39;re they&#39;re great. And the
girls are probably just like whatever,
you know. I mean, it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t
think there&#39;s going to be a big thing
like they took a spot away from my
daughter to cheer and make, you know.
Oh, it&#39;s coming.
$400. I think they now make $400 a game.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that much, but it&#39;s
it&#39;s better than it used to be. It used
to be like $25.
I remember I remember where I was when I
said, &#34;I want to be one of those
cheerleaders.&#34; And my mom was like, &#34;You
know, they make $15 a game.&#34; And I just
was like, &#34;Well, then I never want to do
it.&#34; Like cuz I thought here these girls
are pretty and they&#39;re on TV. Like I
didn&#39;t think that it would be like no
money and now but now I feel like now
with like the now they have reality
shows and the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader
show and everything like now once it
gets cool again now it&#39;s like well
enjoy it for the next few years before
it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know. Good for them.
Who cares? But um do you think I mean
what do you do?
I don&#39;t care. I mean, I&#39;ve never You
don&#39;t see the cheerleaders on TV anyway.
If you&#39;re at the live game,
cheerleaders never can like date. Oh my
gosh. Oh my gosh. I just got a vision. I
got a vision.
You know, recently they did like a
Lifetime Hallmark type movie that was
basically Travis and Taylor.
Yes, I remember. I think I watched it.
Get ready. There is going to be a movie,
a gay love story.
Okay. about a football player and the
male cheerleader. It&#39;s going to happen.
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be Hallmark
Lifetime or Independent.
First it&#39;ll be gay porn.
Yeah. They&#39;re already making two years
making a couple blocks away.
There is going to be a movie that you&#39;re
going to be able to watch.
That it&#39;s going to be like home for the
You know, and who are you bringing home?
He&#39;s bringing home a cheerleader,
Yeah. No, I&#39;m bringing home, you know,
get ready.
I like it. I like it.
I keep waiting for the folders
commercial like best put away and it&#39;s
two old gay grandpas. I said that&#39;s when
we know that we&#39;ve really come all the
Haven&#39;t they done that already?
Not with old ones.
They don&#39;t have They no not on
mainstream TV. It&#39;s only younger pe
younger people, right? Showing their
It&#39;s like we got to go visit the two
grandmas and then the two grandpas and
then there&#39;ll be like a hippie grandma
that clearly was one one was married to
one of them. Yeah. And they all sit
around and have Folders Coffee Christmas
I&#39;m all for it. I walk down the aisle to
uh pretty much every weekend I get on
Delta Airlines. And as you walk down the
little jetway, they have little posters
that you show different people
vacationing in different places to to
promote Delta Airlines.
And uh it&#39;s a lot of gay couples in
those, but you know, it&#39;s like it&#39;s like
iffy. They could be friends. You know,
it&#39;s a guy&#39;s lying his head on the other
guy&#39;s shoulder watching a movie on the,
you know, on the plane. Obviously, well,
they could also be friends,
right? It&#39;s telling you like, &#34;Hey, come
to Puerto Rico. Come to uh Porttoard or
whatever because you&#39;re going to be well
received here if you want to put your
head on your best friend&#39;s shoulder.&#34;
Yeah, it&#39;s all good.
I say bring it on, you know.
Okay. This uh this number one Netflix
doc called um what was it called? It&#39;s
The Biggest Loser. The reality of The
Biggest Loser.
Yeah. But it&#39;s called something else.
It&#39;s called like
fit for TV.
Fit for TV. But but it&#39;s about The
Biggest Loser. Of course, that was a
huge show where they would take these
contestants back in the mid 2000s and
actually Caroline Ray, the comedian, was
the host at first.
She was really
and then she left and this other girl
that was a former soap star came and I
was looking it up last night because I
think I recall that either she didn&#39;t
want to do it anymore or they didn&#39;t
want her because she wasn&#39;t, you know,
super thin. Yeah.
to be hosting it. But when I asked, you
know, the internet what it was like, no,
she left after three years because she
got married and wanted to do other
things. Okay.
But I feel like there was either
something where she didn&#39;t feel right
about or whatever. She was not part of
it. The other um Jillian Michaels was
not part of it. She was the pretty
brunette that like, you know, this they
had these trainers and these really
heavy people would come and the
competition was whoever could lose the
most amount of weight at the end would
get $250,000.
And they would do it, you know, up to
six months long of just working out six
to seven hours a day, not eating, but
then there&#39;d be these weird challenges
where they&#39;re like, if you eat all the
food, you get money. So, it&#39;s like, do
you want to eat the food
and make some extra money? Yeah. But
then you&#39;ll also have to work those
calories off.
And then I think they got rid of that.
They thought that was bad. And then
sounds pretty bad.
And it&#39;s just like crazy that like of
course they all got it starts off with
this one guy who was really fat his
whole life. He goes he wins. They show
him winning. Yeah.
And the family&#39;s like what? And he&#39;s
like, you know, he&#39;s like your size now.
And and then they cut to and you know he
goes to sit down in the chair of the
dock and he can barely fit you know like
oh he&#39;s fat again.
Totally fatter than before he started.
Oh really?
And they&#39;re like you know it&#39;s just un
it&#39;s not sustainable because who has
to work out six to seven hours a day.
Right. So when you lose it that quick
obviously and you know all your meals
are prepared for you and everything and
then you go back to like your home and
you have to go work at the factory and
stand out on your feet and they&#39;re
serving cake for your co-worker&#39;s
birthday like yeah it just there&#39;s all
the other things but then they kind of
dissed OMPic a little bit in it.
Um like oh now you can take a shot. It&#39;s
like yeah thank god.
I mean yeah the show would be out of
Thank god. Yeah
Yeah. Do you remember it? And then they
would make them take off their shoes.
I do remember it. I mean, I don&#39;t think
I&#39;ve ever watched, but I remember it was
a big hit.
Um, yeah, it was a So, what do they say?
They were treated badly and stuff and
and uh
it was unhealthy the way they lost
weight. Right.
Right. And then the humiliation of
pulling off your shirt. So, if you&#39;re a
girl, they&#39;d pull off your shirt and you
just have like your sports bra.
And your like, you know, midriff and
stuff. And then the guys, it would be
full naked like man boobs, whatever. And
I&#39;m just remembering now that um this
housewife, Shannana Bador, she struggled
with her weight at one time and her
trainer came and he&#39;s like, &#34;Take off
your shirt.&#34; And she did. She took off
her shirt and he&#39;s like, &#34;Whoa.&#34;
And she had a sports and I&#39;m like
realizing, &#34;Oh my god, somebody
remembered that from um The Biggest
Loser, some producer or something must
have said to do it.&#34; And she she does
whatever they want her to do. So I&#39;m
&#34;Oh my god.&#34; Like it was exactly that
where it was like, &#34;Oh, okay.&#34; Like
jarring. Um, yeah. So, a lot of people
are and, you know, we lived through it,
so we know how [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up things are.
Like, now every single doc we&#39;ve lived
through. And I&#39;m like, and younger
people like, can you believe I see a Tik
Tok being like, let me tell you what
happened with this reality show that,
yeah, we know.
Um, Charlie Sheen.
Tiger Blood. He&#39;s got his dock coming
out, I think, this week on Netflix.
And all about his life. And I think
Denise Richards, who&#39;s now going through
this terrible divorce with her second
husband, is in it. And the tiger blood.
I mean, do you remember being the
Chelsea with the Tiger Blood?
Oh my god, it was heaven. I remember it
was just every day was so easy because
it was just another thing. Crazy tweet.
He literally losing his mind.
Every day he would do go wild
and then just totally like was like, &#34;I
hate you, Chuck Law. You&#39;re piece of
shit.&#34; Then he lost two and a half men.
And then who was the guy that would go
on tour with us? Well, he went on tour.
Kirk Fox went on tour with
No. Yeah, but I mean
Oh, Jeff Wills. Yeah.
Jeff Wills of Live Nation is like,
&#34;Yeah, we&#39;re going on tour.&#34; I mean, he
was like the the modernday like YouTube
star or whatever that will go do a tour
and, you know, they&#39;re never going to do
it again. Yeah. But it&#39;s a money grab
for everyone involved,
right? Apparently, it was the people who
went to see it live was just like it was
right? Rambled on for hours.
Yeah. trying to do standup and then like
end quickly and and whatever. And I
remember Chelsea being like to him like
what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you do? Why would you
even do this? And it&#39;s like well
it&#39;s money like he&#39;s the hottest ticket
in town. We&#39;ll make some money off him.
It was wild that era. So So now this
trailer is just going to be about that
era of his life or what he&#39;s up to.
It&#39;s just everybody. I mean some of
these some of these docs appear to be
pretty [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] lazy too. Yeah,
like it&#39;s time for a doc. Fine.
He probably needs the money. They
probably sit in the diner for two days.
And then we&#39;ll get everybody in your
life to also talk about what a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
freak you were or what a great guy you
or but you know, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re
going to get Cory Feldman on there
who claims that it was he who essayed a
Corey Hay allegedly on the Lucas set.
I&#39;ve heard that, too. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. But I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not part of
this, Doc.
I don&#39;t know. I did see a lot of They
got a lot of big people in like Sean
Penn and Oh, yeah.
They got some big stars to be
Yeah. I remember he was like engaged to
that porn star Gretching.
Ginger. Yeah. I knew it was a G name.
I do remember that.
Yeah. And then I had I had Denise
Richards on my show and she said one
time it was Thanksgiving and he and I
she invited him because you know he&#39;s
the girl&#39;s father and he had um either
one or two uh you know sex workers just
in the car in the driveway and she&#39;s
like you don&#39;t want to invite them in.
He&#39;s like no. So then she just brought
out a plate for them.
Oh for the for the hookers.
Oh that&#39;s nice. That&#39;s You got to hear
more about that from Denise Richards.
Oh, Denise Richard was so nice to when
he had his other wife, Brooke Mueller,
who was a severe drug addict. I don&#39;t
know how many times she&#39;s been in rehab.
Last I checked, it was 21 times. Her
boys when they were like four-year-old
boy twins, Denise had them come and live
with the girls and it was, you know,
very hard. Um, but she&#39;s always been so
nice. And then I think she had Broo
Mueller on her reality show, too. See,
she&#39;s been too nice. That&#39;s why now she
has this other awful husband,
right? Worst picker ever.
She&#39;s had it tough.
Yeah. But so that one&#39;s coming. Kanye&#39;s
doc is coming.
Oh man. I guess you just got to go
completely insane and then they&#39;ll make
a dock about you. Uh
it looks like it&#39;s all his footage,
From when he&#39;s like Kim&#39;s crying going,
&#34;This wasn&#39;t your personality a few
years ago.&#34; And him screaming being
like, &#34;I could have killed my daughter.&#34;
When he says, you know, when Kim
announced she was pregnant, he was like,
&#34;Get an abortion.&#34; And now then he felt
bad about it and then um it&#39;s him doing
the church that that went away.
Yeah. Sunday services
in Calabasas. Remember that?
Sure. Sure. Do I ever couldn&#39;t? Yeah.
That looks fun.
And also then he did at the forum like
where are all those people that were
singing and all that.
And then and then and now he just wears
like you know layers and layers of black
sweats while Bianca has to wear like a
spaghetti strap.
Are they still together now? I see them.
back together.
They&#39;re just they were just out and you
know she has to wear heels and like
little pants
and a top and while he&#39;s dressed in
layers of just I&#39;m just imagining the bo
because I remember someone said before
Kim got with him she said he had really
bad BO and bad breath.
Oh really?
I did not hear that but someone someone
said that it&#39;s out there.
I could get I could sense a BO coming
off him. I just look at him and I&#39;m they
look those are very BO inducing clothes
he wears.
Yeah. can&#39;t walk around the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
valley in August.
He&#39;s dressed like a tire. And that&#39;s
going to be hot. That&#39;s got to be hot.
Um, so I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re going
to show of it. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re
they&#39;re going to get into the slavery
comments, the anti.
Is this a Netflix one, too?
Maybe it&#39;s just YouTube. I could see it
being just YouTube. Um, also on Hulu is
the Amanda Knoxtock
that uh that uh Monica Lewinsky is
producing and is part of it and they&#39;re
doing like uh um interviews together
about it. Basically saying, you know,
Monica&#39;s like, I could relate to her
because we were two young pretty, you
know, girls. She didn&#39;t say pretty, but
they were both two young pretty
brunettes and the way the world reacted
and everything. The Amanda Knox story is
so crazy and juicy. To remind you guys,
she was studying abroad in Italy and
came home from drinking and was with her
boyfriend and unbeknownst to her, her
roommate was stabbed to death in the
roommate&#39;s room and found her the next
day. and the Italian police and
everybody um felt that she had done it,
that she and her boyfriend did it in a
weird like threesome kind of a thing.
And it&#39;s just crazy that there&#39;ll be
certain moments that they get of a
suspect right after that etch in
people&#39;s brains forever, which was as
the police were coming and doing
everything, she&#39;s outside and she&#39;s her
boyfriend&#39;s hugging her and they&#39;re just
Like a little more than just a pack.
like they&#39;re like but it&#39;s probably
you never like that&#39;s a weird reaction.
Yeah, it probably knew love and it was
just probably like whatever. It just
felt natural and he tried to kiss her
she kissed him back but it was always
like oh yeah she&#39;s guilty like I
remember there was this other woman who
um was accused of and and got convicted.
She said, &#34;I came home, you know, I came
down the stairs. I heard something and
my two boys, little boys that fell
asleep on the couch were stabbed to
death.&#34; And she always said, &#34;Someone
must have broken in and did it.&#34; And
they said it was her. And before her
trial or whatever, it was their one of
their birthdays. So, she went to their
graves and she was spraying silly spray
on it because that&#39;s what they love,
silly string or whatever.
And somebody saw it and that was all
over the news because she was like
laughing doing it and they&#39;re like, &#34;Oh,
clearly she&#39;s guilty.&#34; like there&#39;s just
these little weird moments that like you
see and
there&#39;s been quite a few of those of
people like their rea their reaction. I
remember even the girl who Maline McCann
I think her name the little girl who&#39;s
who disappeared from
from the uh couple that couple always
had very odd behavior after it was
Right. We&#39;re still looking for her.
That one to remind people is they went
on vacation and they had twins and a
four-year-old girl. The twins were two
and they would put them to bed and then
they would go out of their little villa
and down and and drink wine and have
dinner with all the other adults.
The amount of times my wife and I have
looked at each other when my daughter&#39;s
asleep in the hotel room and go, &#34;It&#39;s
right down the hallway.&#34; And then we
both go, &#34;Yeah, but remember,&#34; and then
we&#39;re like, &#34;All right, we&#39;ll stay
here.&#34; Yeah. My daughter goes to bed at
5:00 in the at night, you know? Well,
now we got to go to bed at 5:00 at
night, otherwise we&#39;ll be the worst
Never do that. So yeah, they came back
and she was gone and there&#39;s been all
these other weird people that said I&#39;m
her and
you know it&#39;s like John two years
there&#39;s a guy who goes I did it.
Yeah, but we never f like we have John
Manet&#39;s we found John Manet&#39;s body like
you know within 24 hours her body was
never found.
No. So people always wonder, I mean, I
think someone like her at four, if she
was adopted, not adopted, but if she was
taken just to be raised, not to be
trafficked or whatever,
like which has happened over time. Like
there was a movie where Michelle
Fefeifer played a a real life woman
whose like 2-year-old was stolen from
her like she went to her high school
reunion. It&#39;s a great movie and Whoopi
Goldberg&#39;s in it and it&#39;s based on true
story and Whoopi and Michelle Fifer has
two older kids and she takes a
two-year-old to like her high school or
college reunion and they&#39;re checking in
and there&#39;s all these people around and
then she&#39;s like, &#34;Where&#39;s Ben?&#34; And they
can&#39;t find him and they never find him.
And then one day um the doorbell rings
and this kid walks up and he&#39;s like,
&#34;Hi, um I&#39;m I have a business. I&#39;m
mowing lawns.&#34; And she sees him and
she&#39;s like, &#34;Oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god.&#34; and she like goes to Whoopy Gold
the detective and she she sees what his
age would progression would look like
and in the end I&#39;m going to ruin it for
you. In the end a girl a girl that she
went to college with or whatever who was
mentally ill stole him. Oh,
then met this man and said, &#34;This is my
child.&#34; And then they got married and
then she killed herself and the dad
raised him just thinking he was the
stepson that had no mother
and they happened to live.
What&#39;s the name of the movie? I never
heard of that movie.
I&#39;ll have to look that one up.
We&#39;ll look it up. But
it&#39;s not gre It&#39;s not Greece, too,
Michelle Fiver&#39;s in that. That doesn&#39;t
sound like a cool
and if it&#39;s cool enough
and we&#39;re going to bowl tonight. We&#39;re
going to bowl tonight. We&#39;re going to
run. We&#39;re going to roll. We&#39;re going to
skip. We&#39;re gonna bowl. We&#39;re going to
Nice job. Who&#39;s the star of that?
Maxwell Kfield
was the Australian version.
And then she was like the bad girl. She
was the bad girl and he was supposed to
be the He was supposed to be like her
Australian like
they only got one person from the
original DD Khan. Remember? She was like
the the wacky friend of Olivia Newton
Yeah. That she was gonna do that. She
was in the um um the the angel one. Oh,
beauty school dropout.
No, she was in beauty school dropout.
So then she stayed at the school to work
in the beauty department.
Beauty school dropout.
Go back to high school.
I just remember seeing that and being
like, &#34;Oh my god, this looks so fun.&#34;
And then I just went to like this all
girl high school that was so not that.
I&#39;m like, &#34;I want to like be with people
that look like they&#39;re 40 and pregnant
with a pot barked guy.&#34;
Yeah. Yes. The guy who raced him. Yeah.
And then they thought that the other
girl was pregnant. The the Connie
got a bun in the oven.
Wait, what was it called?
It went through it went they were at the
drive-in and everyone started gossiping
about it. That&#39;s when you said, &#34;Oh,
Oh, I know. Every I&#39;ve seen that movie.
Stalker Channing. And then at the final
last day of school, they had the
carnival, which I was always like, &#34;Why
don&#39;t we have a carnival on the last day
of school?&#34; Like it was such a relief
that sunny feeling like it would be
sunny out and you&#39;d finish your finals
and it&#39;s like you&#39;re at leaving school
at like 11:15. Like I was like where is
that? And then and then they&#39;re on the
ferris wheel or whatever. And then she&#39;s
like I got my period and everyone&#39;s like
we go to Wait, you&#39;re getting too
confused. You&#39;re right. We go together
Can I tell you one thing that angered me
about that movie and I still does to
this day? I&#39;ve seen it a million times.
At the end, the very end, they&#39;re they
get in the car, Olivia and John, John
Dennis singing,
and then the car flies away and it I
angered me so much cuz the whole movie
was based in some type of reality. And
then when the car flew at the end, I&#39;m
like, why did the car fly at the end?
Right. And it was a big And it was a big
play prior to that, a big uh musical. So
like, why don&#39;t
Why did the car fly? It really upset me
as a child.
I think it did too to me, too. Yeah.
All right. Well, anyway.
All right. Well, there&#39;s that. And then
Jesse Smlette, he too is going to have a
uh doc about
how his life is, what happened.
I mean, is he still hanging on to the
fact that it wasn&#39;t he wasn&#39;t lying?
I think he still is saying he&#39;s not like
I think it&#39;s going to be like a Sher
Pini where he&#39;s going to do I think this
is going to be like, okay, I did do this
and this, but I did not do that.
Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s not a bad angle for a
guy who&#39;s pretty much his career is kind
of like over.
He&#39;s on the special forces.
Yeah, he&#39;s on special forces.
I mean, I just think it would be so much
better when if people just said,
&#34;Yeah, I I I was wrapped up in what was
going on politically. I felt like I was
being like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] over by Empire.&#34; And I
met these two guys and
um he could even say it was their idea.
And I was like, &#34;All right.&#34; And then
and then I realized, wait, this is
really bad. The c I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t
realize the country was going to get so
upset about it. Um thinking that there
were like, you know, MAGA people that
would do this to me and then I just
didn&#39;t know what to do.
But see, he can&#39;t do that because he
appealed it. So the reason what So he
did he only did nine days in jail. He
got convicted.
He got out after nine days because they
appealed it. But because of because he
originally did a plea deal, there was
something that they screwed up in
Chicago. Because he already did a plea
deal, they cannot retry it. So he&#39;ll
never go back. But he still is so he&#39;s
still claiming it&#39;s his innocence.
And those two guys that were like from
Africa that were his personal trainers.
Oh. That Yeah. They were the ones who
who helped him out with it, right?
Yeah. I always remember when because I
was doing Wendy Williams that day and
they&#39;re like two masked white men and
I&#39;m like well if they&#39;re masked
how do you know if they&#39;re
like white?
Well, you remember uh when it happened
when it went down we were doing Juicy
Scoop and I remember
we called each other that day.
I remember going there&#39;s something off
about this story right from the get-go.
Well, so I never bought it from the
beginning.
Yeah. Anyway, very
I mean I will just say because it&#39;s the
end of the show, there is a very sad
thing going on where this couple in
Ukipa are saying that their child was
kidnapped while the mom was changing his
diaper at a big lot. And it was very
suspicious right off the bat that
they&#39;re not being truthful because she
said while she was changing in the back
seat, she&#39;s like, &#34;And I parked in in
the darkest part of the parking lot and
there happens to be no cameras there.&#34;
So there&#39;s no cameras. like they&#39;re
making it like they&#39;re telling on
themselves like
and the kid was was special needs or
something.
Well, they never said that he was, but
the photos of him look like he
definitely has a lazy eye, right?
Which some people think was that a
result of maybe there was already abuse
happening. We don&#39;t know. Yeah. Um, but
he&#39;s seven months old and the way she&#39;s
hyperventilating and crying in the thing
and she has a black eye and she said, &#34;I
have this black eye because this because
while I&#39;m changing him, someone tapped
me on the shoulder and said, &#34;Ola,&#34; and
then punched me and I fell to the floor.
She didn&#39;t say the ground, but she would
have been on the ground, concrete
And then when I came to my baby wasn&#39;t
So then she, there&#39;s no witnesses to it.
She ran into the store and said, &#34;Did
you see a baby?&#34; And they&#39;re holding a
poster that says missing kid.
Who? Who? Now, who&#39;s holding that?
The husband.
And they just wrote it on a on a card.
So, they made their own flyer that says
missing kid. Not kidnapped
seven-month-old baby boy.
Missing kid. It&#39;s not missing. It was
kidnapped. That&#39;s a different thing.
Like a missing would be like my child
was riding on his bike and never made it
to the front house.
So, have they arrested this family, this
couple yet? Soon, right? As of today of
recording on Monday, um they are they
took the other children away from the
home, the 2-year-old at least, and
another child. Um there&#39;s the timeline&#39;s
all off. She said she was at her
stepson&#39;s game and he needed a new
mouthguard and that&#39;s why they went to
Big Five. People all said, &#34;We never saw
the baby at that game.&#34;
And so they think something happened to
the baby and they&#39;re covering it up
and it&#39;s very, very sad. But right off
the bat, it was like Susan Smith. It was
just really not. So that&#39;s happening.
I mean, I really am father of the year,
you know, when you read stories like
that cuz I at this point I haven&#39;t
gotten to that yet.
No, you you are.
She&#39;s pretty nice, though. She doesn&#39;t
give me
No, she&#39;s a delight. Look at her. She&#39;s
Did you get the topics together, Becky?
Wait till Wait till I get out of here.
She&#39;s not going to be happy about this.
She&#39;s going to be fe Did you see Did you
see the way I did her hair, by the way?
I don&#39;t know how to do girls hair.
It&#39;s just that a low pony.
I I did the low I do the low pony. I do
the low pony. Sometimes my wife&#39;s like,
&#34;I need you to do the pony higher.&#34; I&#39;m
like, &#34;I don&#39;t know how to do that. I
don&#39;t know how.&#34;
Oh my god. I remember.
So my dad having to do our hair. Like my
mom, I don&#39;t know where she was, but she
was always around when we were little.
And we were like meeting, we were going
to the Beverly Hills Hotel to meet his
sister who was like, &#34;Aunt Claire, um, I
don&#39;t want to go all the way to the
valley. meet me in the city at the
Beverly Hills Hotel. She was from Sag
Oh my god.
And um so my mom&#39;s like, &#34;You have to
like do her hair or whatever.&#34; And my
dad was just like like so stressed about
it. I remember we had to go in the
backyard. I don&#39;t know why. And he&#39;s
just like trying to like do like
ponytail. And then as the little girl
like when your dad is not doing it the
way your mom, it&#39;s like what? And it was
like one was here, one was here. It was
like nodded. And my mom like comes and I
remember she&#39;s like, &#34;What?&#34; And I think
I even had like some like I think I was
just getting over like chickenpox or
something and he put me in like a wool
outfit like a wool pink like Jackie
outfit or something. I was like, &#34;What
are you doing?&#34; Like we&#39;re going to the
Beverly Hills Hotel to meet your like
snoody sister. Her hair looks like But I
mean, of course, why would a guy know
how to do hair?
Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t. I I Yeah, I try. But
speaking of uh guys, so um
Beat Davidson, father to be
father to be. He&#39;s a father to be. Who&#39;s
his girlfriend?
Some model,
but she&#39;s not as famous as his previous
girlfriend.
No, she&#39;s not.
And he&#39;s doing a podcast and he just is
saying like um you know that that
sometimes men can be objectified too,
which I thought was pretty interesting.
He&#39;s like, &#34;I&#39;m on SNL and all any skit
or anything or anyone want to talk to me
about is that of who I was dating.&#34; And
then it became pretty clear because I
did I did talk to this one girl who said
she saw his dick
big dick
in a photo and it is big.
And I&#39;m like, &#34;How did you see it?&#34; And
she knew somebody and so it did go
around that it is legit a big dick.
Okay. And that&#39;s when I think other
women like a Kim Kardashian other people
were like I&#39;d like to take this for a
So you think you think that&#39;s what
started because he was doing
I think it helped. I think I think it
helped. It was like why the hell not?
So when when big dick energy got out
there people like oh
it wasn&#39;t just energy.
It was just he had actually had big
He actually as my dad would say it had a
10-inch brain.
I never heard that one before. It&#39;s
pretty good.
So yeah. And then he was like, &#34;Yeah,
everyone was just like, you know,
talking about my stick or whatever.&#34; And
uh and it was never about my comedy or
what clever things I was, you know,
saying or doing. Yeah.
And um so I kind of appreciate that, but
also he was like, you know, he&#39;s
struggling with addiction and drugs. I
always just thought about when he was
dating um Kaia Gerby Gerber. Yeah.
And he was like almost 30 and she was
like 18, right? and he was having like a
drug addict episode and Cindy Crawford
and the dad, the husband, like came to
the New York apartment to like be with
Kaia. And I&#39;m just like, &#34;Oh, they must
have just been like, &#34;Could you please,
Really? This is like that would stress
me out if my young gorgeous model who
hadn&#39;t even been to college cuz she went
right into modeling is dating Pete
Davidson.&#34; Like that is not somebody you
want your kid dating.
Then you ran right to the Elvis guy.
Yeah. Now that&#39;s much better.
Small dick energy.
I&#39;ll tell you here just quickly to going
back to my trip to Iceland and Dicks.
I&#39;ll I&#39;ll bring it all together.
There&#39;s a lot of lagoons they call them
in Iceland. Go to the blue lagoon. Yeah.
What I&#39;ve learned is lagoon just means
public pool. I&#39;ve learned that anyway. I
don&#39;t want to I love Iceland, but to the
it&#39;s a pool. So, uh
and then you have to shower beforehand,
And so there was a lot I&#39;m I&#39;m just not
like locker room. But is the lagoon like
naturally hot and is like the hot
It&#39;s very hot. It&#39;s hot. It&#39;s salty.
Whatever. It&#39;s got sulfur.
You feel healthier since your trip?
Sure. It&#39;s Well, that was part of the
problem. It&#39;s It&#39;s supposed to have
healing, you know, uh
properties, capabilities.
So, a lot of old people were going in. I
think it was like cocoon, you know, they
were like, &#34;All right, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] it. I&#39;m
going in. See if I can turn this
around.&#34; So, I you had to go into the
locker room first and shower and then
head into the lagoon. So, I saw a lot of
things like a lot like people who you
know it goes south in a hurry at a
certain age.
And most dicks I&#39;m gonna say this
because I saw quite a few dicks in
I&#39;m going to say most dicks are not Pete
Davidson dicks. Everybody&#39;s got like a I
want to call I&#39;m going to say a grower,
not a shower just you know.
Well, especially if you&#39;re elderly, too.
Yeah. But it was young and old. Young
and old. everybody. There was not one
person where I was like, &#34;Whoa, look at
this energy going on here.&#34;
You know, where do you stand on that?
I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I mean, I
think I think I always feel bad for guys
that are born with like an unusually
small penis. They&#39;re with a part in
Scary Movie 2
that they show like a photo and it&#39;s
like a tiny dick
like like of a man&#39;s body. And um the
story I remember someone telling me from
the Wayne&#39;s brother&#39;s world is somebody
on the crew said,
&#34;I&#39;m not going to tell you who like
someone just said gave them a photo and
said you can use me because like you&#39;re
going to have a hard time finding one
that small, but I actually have one that
small.&#34; And they never knew who it was.
Whoa. Really?
But yeah. And then but I always felt
like you know what&#39;s great like what&#39;s
hard is like a girl who&#39;s like flat or
whatever she can get a boob job.
And you can do those. There are things
you can do if your dick is is unusually
And I say you do it.
Women are horrible.
What can you do?
I think you can put like a little
Not that Listen people, not that I need
I think you could put a growth in it
just like you could like a little stint.
Oh yeah. Yeah. like a little just make
it like so it&#39;s big I think and then
it&#39;s like bigger all the so it&#39;s just
bigger normal and then once you get hard
then it gets a little bit bigger but at
least it&#39;s like
of an average normal size
either that or just make a lot of money
and you&#39;ll be fine.
Yeah. And nobody will care and just rub
it you.
Um, okay. Last thing is in the podcast
world. I know people have been dying for
this, but it&#39;s um Halaria and her
daughter Garaman, and they have a
podcast because people have been begging
for this.
By the way, do you follow her on
Instagram? I do. She has gone over the
top like trying to be funny and dancing.
Painful. It is painful.
And now the daughter&#39;s like, &#34;Mom,&#34; you
know, and she&#39;s like, &#34;Well, you know
what you can do is you don&#39;t have to.
You can be your friends, your child&#39;s
best friend, but you have to do it in a
certain way that&#39;s right for your
family. And we&#39;re going to talk about it
all, the good, the bad, the ugly. D. And
I&#39;m like,
so the book must have went nowhere,
I think the book went nowhere. And I
don&#39;t think the show&#39;s coming back.
That&#39;s what I think.
Oh, the show&#39;s.
And so they&#39;re like, &#34;Well, now we&#39;ll
just make this younger girl work.&#34;
And she&#39;s got to have more behind her.
yeah, you&#39;re right. If she doesn&#39;t
Yeah. It&#39;ll be like an audition room for
who&#39;s ever Yeah. I was watching um
another podcast of a a famous housewife
daughter that has a podcast and she was
asking someone questions. I don&#39;t know,
but it was on Zoom and like Page Six
picked it up and the way she&#39;s like
reading the question word for word on
her computer.
I&#39;m like you can&#39;t even just say oh it
was interview she was interviewing Black
And she you know had this thing written
out that the producer wrote her this
long ass sentence to be like tell us
about the Kardashians and Rob and
everything. And then she&#39;s just And then
Black China is like, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m not
talking about that.&#34; Right?
That was the
And then finally someone goes like,
&#34;God, you really can&#39;t even think of a
natural way to ask that question without
reading it verbatim while you&#39;re doing
like a taped zoom.&#34;
Speaking of crazy old men having kids at
a Did you see that Al Puccino just is
his fourth with that girlfriend?
That girlfriend 82, he&#39;s having another
get over here.
I&#39;m gonna give you a ride.
Wait, can you do before we end it, can

Well, hi Steve. Well, this is crazy.
Miranda, I can&#39;t believe I mean of all
the the people I guess this one is big
gal, you know, he couldn&#39;t have got
somebody else pregnant. It&#39;s crazy that
I don&#39;t know what to say. You know, I
I&#39;m a mess. The woman I&#39;m dating has
left me because one of her dogs has a
limp. And I&#39;m trying to make it that
Brady has some type of career and now
you&#39;re going to give this to me like

She goes, &#34;I&#39;m famous, too.&#34; And I was
like, &#34;What?&#34; Like I didn&#39;t And and so
my like I don&#39;t understand why she said
people get weird when you know they get
nervous. I don&#39;t know what it is. That&#39;s
why when people like, &#34;Oh, I met that
person. He was a dick.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Were
they a dick or were you a dick?&#34; Because
a lot of times,
I remember one time I was kind of
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] because I was like, the only
thing I don&#39;t like is when like there&#39;s
a group of people. Yeah. And it&#39;s women.
It&#39;s always women. Sometimes men are
like whatever. But it&#39;s if it&#39;s a group
of women and like three know who I am
and like two don&#39;t
and they&#39;re all excited and then they
would just be the other girls like I
don&#39;t know who you are. It&#39;s
like I didn&#39;t approach you. I didn&#39;t
approach you and go, &#34;Hello, I&#39;m a big
star. You should love me.&#34; Like your
friends came to me.
It&#39;s usually the person who has to take
the picture and they got to say just
before they take a picture, I want you.
I have no idea who you are, but I&#39;m all
right. Thank you. I was feeling pretty
good about myself.
Exactly. Like I was all excited because
your three other friends were excited
and like
there you go.
