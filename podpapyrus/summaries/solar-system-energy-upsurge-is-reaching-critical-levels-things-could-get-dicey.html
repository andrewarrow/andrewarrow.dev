Hey everyone, geoysicist Stefan Burns
here. We are right now in an upsurge of
energy that is unfolding not only here
on Earth but across the entire solar
system. And this is unfolding across
multiple time scales. Different
wavelengths of rhythms, longer duration,
shorter duration, they all seem to be
leading to a culmination moment in the
near future. We have multiple lines of
evidence for this. We&#39;re going to start
with Kilaway because it just had its
31st eruption yesterday. I was there
myself. I saw it. It was spectacular.
And in fact, this was the strongest
eruption that has occurred at Kilaway
across its recent 31 episodes. They
started back up in December of 2024.
And well, now episode 31 has been the
strongest. So the overall radiative
power as we can see here was stronger
than episode 30 which was stronger than
the prior episode and you can go all the
way back in the data and see that in
fact the radiative power was the highest
for this 31st eruption. Why does that
matter? Well, Kiloa is part of the
largest volcanic system on Earth which
is effectively the big island of Hawaii.
There is a mantle plume, a hot spot
which feeds energy to the basically
direct center of the Pacific plate, the
largest geological plate on Earth. And
well, it&#39;s increasing in the amount of
energy and magma flow and lava and more.
So, this is indicating just increased
convection and energy flow through the
deep earth reaching the surface. And
this isn&#39;t the only evidence we have of
this longerterm trend of increasing
energy activity and this energy upsurge.
We also have solar activity. We are in
solar cycle 25 maximum. It has been
stronger than solar cycle 24 maximum.
And we are still in that maximum period.
That&#39;s probably going to start declining
around the middle of 2026. And the
descending phase will take us all the
way to solar minimum around 2029, 2030,
2031. We are still in a period of
greatly enhanced solar flux. This is
radio flux. This is X-ray flux, extreme
ultraviolet light radiation. All these
measures are higher during solar
maximum. And right now, one of these
shorter term rhythms is that we have
some big sunspots soon to rotate onto
the Earth-facing side of the sun. Right
now, they&#39;re on the eastern limb, hidden
just a little bit out of view, but they
will be showing up in just the next day
or two on the Earthfacing side. And
while we had that huge far side coronal
mass ejection that occurred, basically a
massive solar explosion, we have had
some other solar flares that have
occurred recently. Overall X-ray flux is
increasing at this moment in time. And
so it looks like things are increasing
as it relates to solar activity and that
we have a twoe period ahead of us where
things could get perhaps a little dicey.
We will have to wait and see. We already
have proton flux increasing from that
massive explosion on the far side of the
sun, showing just how powerful that was.
Because for there to be an explosion in
that location on the sun, yet for it to
push dramatically higher levels of
energetic protons to Earth means it&#39;s
cutting across the normal flow of the
solar wind, meaning it&#39;s a very, very
strong explosion that occurred. And so
if we get something like that to occur
in a more favorable position, not only
could that coronal mass ejection, which
would likely launch out, hit the Earth,
be a solar storm impact, trigger a
geomagnetic storm, we could also have a
very powerful radiation storm from that.
And that is not an energetic influence
that we&#39;ve had in the recent couple
weeks or even couple months. We&#39;ve had a
little bit of a break from these
radiation storms, but we&#39;ve had a lot of
earthquake activity. So that&#39;s another
one of these trends that we are seeing.
We had that magnitude 8.8 mega quake on
July 29th and now just recently we had
that 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the
Drake Passage. Interesting note about
those two earthquakes is that they are
nearly each other&#39;s antipode. And so you
had that big mega quake in Kamaka. And
then nearly on the opposite side of the
earth, you have another big earthquake
just to the south of South America and
north of Antarctica where there was a
magnitude 7.4 earthquake in May earlier
this year. So there seems to be a bit of
a pingpong effect where you had this
magnitude 7.4 4 Drake passage and then a
couple months pass boom you get a
magnitude 8.8 kamaka and then less than
a month later boom you get a magnitude
7.5 back in the Drake passage and so
there seems to be this energy peeing
back and forth between the two and
because we are in solar maximum because
of all these energetic changes occurring
deeper within the earth which Kilawea
and other volcanoes in their eruptive
episodes are giving us a glimpse into.
It seems likely that we are going to
continue to see increased earthquake
activity across the globe for the
remainder of 2025 and into 2026. Now the
big disruptor to this entire system,
Earth, Sun, solar system, perhaps even
beyond cosically is three Atlas. This
unusual interstellar object which is
flying through our solar system at
incredible velocities. Right now it
velocity is about 58 km/s. When it has
its perihelion, its closest approach to
the sun, it will speed up as a result of
the increased gravitational forces, it
will go all the way up to 68 km/s. This
is very, very fast. So, not only is it
the largest interstellar object that we
have ever observed, it&#39;s only the third
one, of course. It&#39;s coma, it&#39;s plasma
dusty cloud that surrounds it is two
times the diameter of the Earth. It&#39;s
also moving through very quickly and it
is moving through the inner solar
system. has a super close flyby to Mars
around the end of September, beginning
of October. Then it has its perfect
planetary geometry with the Earth and
the other planets in the inner solar
system around October 21st, 22nd. Then
it has its perihelion just about a week
later. And then on its flyby out of the
solar system, it will have a very close
flyby to Jupiter. So it&#39;s very unique.
It&#39;s interacting with some of the
planets very directly and it already
seems to be increasing solar activity
because all these recent solar flares
and explosions and that mega explosion
that occurred just a few days ago all
happened effectively right in line with
Mars and three atlas and so as it gets
closer and closer and closer to
perihelion I personally expect there to
be increasing solar activity but we will
just have to wait and see but there is
quite a bit of evidence supportive of
that, namely the flyby of AmuA Mua in
2017. Not only did we see some big
ex-class flares right around its
perihelion, we also had a magnitude 8.2
earthquake in Mexico 1 day before its
perihelion, September 8th, 2017. And
then we had a double-digit X-class flare
on September 10th. And there was also a
very powerful X-class flare that
occurred just a few days before that.
So, will we see something similar with
three Atlas? We&#39;ll have to wait and see,
but we&#39;re already it looks like seeing
effects from this disruptions to the
overall electric circuit of our solar
system. One way that this works is that
you have this electric current that
flows along the ecliptic plane in a
spiral fashion inwards to the sun. And
so effectively, the sun is aware of
where all the planets are because it&#39;s
been working with the planets. They
revolve around the sun and it&#39;s been
doing this for millions of years,
billions of years. And so there are
flows and rhythms within the sun
connected to all the different planets,
but they are known forces and factors.
Sometimes they come together in a
planetary geometry that can enhance
solar activity, but in general it&#39;s an
accounted for thing. Now you have this
large plasified object flying through
the solar system. It effectively
shortcircuits the normal system because
it&#39;s bringing in this highly conductive
body closer in where typically there
isn&#39;t anything. So the electric circuit
has a short circuit like literally
shorter to the sun as a result enhances
the energy flow and well if you have any
sunspots these magnetic disturbances on
the sun and they have these double
layers that build up charge and energy
when that new enhanced flow of energy
flows through that double layer that can
cause these sort of explosions which we
call solar flares. And if there&#39;s a big
enough destabilization you get that
chronal mass ejection. And so as it gets
closer and closer and closer, its
shortcircuit destabilization effect I
would think is going to increase in
potency, especially as sunspot numbers
continue to rebound from their May lows.
So I think we have a lot of solar
activity ahead of us this fall. We have
some very powerful planetary resonances
that&#39;ll be following up immediately
after that. First, we have to get
through September, which is eclipse
season. Happy new moon. We just had our
new moon, everybody. The next moon will
be a lunar eclipse that is a full moon
and then after that we have a partial
solar eclipse. So we are firmly in
eclipse season and then that partial
solar eclipse occurs within 24 hours of
the equinox boom shakalaka. Then we were
in October on the 1st we have three
atlas conjunct Mars and heliocentrically
both of them conjunct Mercury and the
sun. And so that is also looking like
it&#39;s going to be a very dynamic time
going all the way through the perihelion
approach to the sun and then November
itself is likely to be very active as
three atlas zooms away from the sun if
it decides to do so. We can&#39;t really say
that is what&#39;s going to happen until it
happens. So we&#39;ll have to wait and see
what this rogue interstellar object
actually does as it moves through our
inner solar system. There is a lot of
uncertainty as to what it is. I think is
just most likely some sort of unique
object that we don&#39;t have a
classification on yet. It&#39;s not maybe
100% a comet. It&#39;s not 100% just a rocky
body like an asteroid. It&#39;s probably
something in between that has some
unique plasma dynamics. And I think as
it gets closer and closer to the sun,
it&#39;s going to increasingly plasmify, as
it heats up and these volatile gases and
water and other things get ionized, it&#39;s
going to become a stronger
electromagnetic potential effectively
and therefore a greater shortcircuit
disruptor. So that is your update for
