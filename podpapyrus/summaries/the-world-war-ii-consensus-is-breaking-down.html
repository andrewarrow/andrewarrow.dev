This is Jonathan Pedro. Welcome to the
symbolic world.
[Applause]
So several years ago I uh coined this
phr. And uh you know the purpose of
saying that I think I said that in 2017
maybe or maybe 2018 I&#39;m not sure. And so
when I started saying that, what I
wanted people to be able to do is to
watch the fool in especially in a world
that was top turvy and upside down
because this is a way that my my brother
Matu frames it is that when the world is
upside down, the fool is the one that in
ways can give you a sign of what is
coming. Can in some ways restore the
world, you know, restore the world right
side up. Now, when you say right side
up, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a question
of morals. It&#39;s a question of a return
to order, right? How in some ways the
the madness of the moment in the the
fool is kind of joking and turning and
at the end he becomes a he becomes a
victim of his own uh ploy and then he
kind of almost inadvertently restores
things uh in the right side up. Okay.
So, I started saying that a while ago in
2019 when I saw that I think it was 2018
or 2019 when when a certain Kanye West
put out an album called Jesus is King. I
kind of could tell and I&#39;ve been telling
people to watch this particular person
because he has a weird he&#39;s like a weird
um tuning fork. He&#39;s a he someone who
catches what is coming. He&#39;s a kind of
inadvertent mystic, you could say. He&#39;s
to I don&#39;t think he does it on purpose,
but he kind of is able to sense what is
happening and and sense what is coming
in the future and is manifesting it
usually in a rather contradictory way.
Uh but nonetheless, he this is how his
life seems to proceed. It&#39;s not, it
doesn&#39;t seem to always be good for his
own soul, but you know, if you watch
him, you can kind of see what&#39;s coming.
And so, you know, in 2018, 2019, uh, he
put out this album, Jesus is King, and
he kind of converted to, uh,
Christianity for a short time, I guess.
And, uh, and you could know by watching
that to see that there were some things
happening. And it kind of foretold or
showed us that there would be a
resurgence of Christianity which
happened during COVID and uh has been
happening ever since. And so we&#39;ve kind
of seen the growth of the traditional
churches especially orthodox church and
the Catholic church. I think it&#39;s
happening in kind of more traditional
Protestant churches as well. But you
know although the you could say the
general statistics is still of decline
of participation in the church there&#39;s a
counter move which is that young people
are coming back and young people are
coming into the church in droves right
my church is bursting at the seams uh
with new converts this is happening all
over America and so he despite himself
uh was able to kind of perceive that in
uh in his move. And so now he&#39;s gone in
a in a whole other direction for I think
a year now. I don&#39;t follow him that
closely anymore because it&#39;s a little
scary. He has uh man even more than a
year now. He&#39;s kind of started to
manifest a uh a kind of Nazi fetish
where he is bringing back all that
imagery, bringing back the swastika and
is, you know, and is bringing back Nazi
imagery. He&#39;s also is bringing back kind
of uh KKK imagery and this kind of weird
uh imagery. Um but as usual he&#39;s doing
it in a absolutely contradictory way. In
some ways I I keep thinking that Kanye
West is is 4chan&#39;s final form or maybe
like Pepe&#39;s final form because he is
doing it and people can&#39;t see the
contradiction which is kind of funny. uh
in the same way that people couldn&#39;t see
the contradiction in Pepe. They only see
the side that they want to see. They
only see the side that is kind of
salient to them and they can&#39;t see that
always proposed as a contradiction. Uh
his latest song which I won&#39;t even say
the words
because it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s like you
can look it up. It&#39;s a song that uh that
uh let&#39;s say calls upon a uh a uh a
certain German chancellor, but the song
in the song the the
the way the song goes is that he uses a
racial slur against black people like
calling black people to recognize the uh
the German
chancellor. And so everybody is saying,
&#34;Don&#39;t you see that Hitler would have
hated black people?&#34; And it&#39;s like, you
don&#39;t understand. You don&#39;t understand
the contradiction. You can&#39;t see that
everything about this manifested itself
in a contradiction. And like I said, not
to the benefit of his soul. It feels
like he&#39;s being ripped apart. Uh but if
you watch, you can kind of see that this
is happening. And it&#39;s happening in
conjunction with a whole lot of other
things that are showing us what is
coming that are showing us what is
happening to us. And uh you know I
didn&#39;t really want to make this video
but it feels like things are becoming so
confused. People are so confused to
watch what&#39;s going on that they are um
they&#39;re struggling to understand. And so
I guess we have to talk about
it. What is happening?
So this has been going on for a little
while in little doses but now things are
kind of getting bigger and bigger and
it&#39;s inevitable. You know all worlds are
based based on a kind of sacred origin.
Every world has a kind of foundation and
a foundation myth on which it is based.
That foundation myth what it does is it
casts the light on the world. It kind of
structures the world. It gives you a
frame. Tells you who the good guys are.
Tells you who the bad guys are. you
know, tells you what&#39;s important. Uh,
also frames space, right? Kind of
stabilizes space for for a while. Um,
you know, and our world is based on
World War II. And I think I don&#39;t have
to explain that. Everybody kind of knows
our geopolitical world is based on World
War II. The way that we understand
ourselves is based on World War II. The
hierarchy of values that we have is
based on World War II. All of this,
right? World War II is a kind of
foundation myth for our world today.
Now, it played an important role in kind
of holding us together. It had its
heroes. It had its uh you could say its
principalities. Um and it had its
enemies. It had its devils and uh it
held the world and created prosperity
for quite a long time. It kind of
stabilized things.
Now, the thing
about foundation myths, or you could say
small foundation myths, is that there&#39;s
always there&#39;s always a sin that&#39;s
hidden in the foundation myth. There&#39;s
always something. There&#39;s always
something because the the world these
small worlds that we participate in,
right? These small stories that we
participate in, they&#39;re not the full
thing. They&#39;re not the full world. They
they are they in order to be co
coherent, they can&#39;t be complete. And so
because of that, they have to push
things into the margins and they have to
push things outside, you could say. Uh
so that they become blind spots and they
become kind of monsters hiding in the
corners that we try to push back, we try
to ignore, we try to to fight. Uh but we
we nonetheless have to do that. And and
I want to be careful that you understand
that this is inevitable. Like this is
something that all worlds do. there&#39;s no
way around it. Um, and this is something
that we did at the end of World War II.
And so, World War II presents itself as
a kind of victory of good over evil, as
an establishing of a kind of world peace
that is going to last. Um, but it also
has a kind of secret. And if you think
about it, you know the secret. you know,
when you when you grew up, uh, you were
told, &#34;We won World War II. We beat the
bad guys.&#34; You know, it was a moment of
victory of good over evil. And, uh, and
that&#39;s that, right? And it established
it, established the world, it
established the world moving towards
democracy and moving towards a kind of
uh, you know, a global vision of peace
and all of that, right? It&#39;s in the wake
uh of World War II that we coined the
end of history idea that uh that now
history is over and that the tensions of
history are over. Of course, that&#39;s all
impossible.
There&#39;s we&#39;re not going to reach the end
of history, at least not because of
World War II. And World War II in order
to hold the stability of things together
had in it a kind of dark
secret, right? And the dark secret is
that who won World War II? Did the good
guys win World War II?
The reality of the war is that we in
order to beat a very very bad person and
a very very bad thing that was happening
in Germany and that was spreading across
the world and could have let&#39;s say
brought the world into a form of
tyranny. We had to ally ourselves with
a tyrant with a horrible person in order
to do that. And then what we did is we
handed half of Europe to that evil
person. And the the level of torture and
of uh you know people being imprisoned
either it&#39;s in Romania or in the Gulag
or uh you know in all of these communist
countries is horrible. The stories are
absolutely horrible. And
so, you know, we kind of in the general
parliament, we tend to hide that aspect
of the story
uh in in order to establish order. And
so, I want to be careful. I want to I
want to be careful. It does not say that
there&#39;s necessarily an it&#39;s necessarily
of ill intent that we hide that, but it
is almost necessary in order to
establish a kind of order. And so, you
have a good guy and a bad guy. And you
know, and for all intents and purposes,
the bad guy is Hitler and Hitler is a
devil. Like Hitler is the devil of our
world. It those two words are
interchangeable. You know, you you call
uh if you want to say that someone is
the worst thing in the world, that&#39;s
what you do. You call them Hitler.
That&#39;s how you characterize it. It&#39;s
even worse than calling someone the
devil. Actually, calling someone Hitler
is worse than calling them a devil.
That&#39;s how much Hitler has become the
devil for our current world.
Um and
um you know but there&#39;s an issue right
is is that you could say it this way is
that this story this myth it has an
expiration date right it can hold the
world together for a certain amount of
time but at some point it will stop
holding the world together. Now the
question is you know that expiration
date we don&#39;t know when it is but it the
the the countdown to that expiration
date started at the end of World War II
and there was there&#39;s no way for World
War II to hold the narrative of the
world together forever and you
understand that whether you whatever you
know whatever you think like you I hope
you can understand that it is impossible
for that story to kind of be the
narrative uh let&#39;s a the narrative
underlying pattern of reality forever.
And it is also impossible for Hitler to
remain the devil of the world forever
because although he is a horrible evil
person, you
know, he cannot be he is not worse than
the devil. He is much less worse than
the devil and he cannot play that role
of being worse than the devil and being
the devil forever. Uh and so there was a
time when that would expire. And so
anybody who knows how stories function
and anybody who knows how stories kind
of capture the worlds and run through
them, you know, knew or knows that at
some point that will
that structure is going to is going to
come apart and some new structure or a
new story will establish itself.
Um I have intuited this a very long time
ago. a very very long time ago and I
have said many times I might even have
said it on a video I&#39;ve said it in
private is that when the last people
that were alive during World War II die
uh the memory you could call it the
memory of that story will start to fade
and that will have major consequences on
our world because the the story holding
the world together is indistinguishable
from memory. That is if we remember the
story then that story has a hold on us.
But as we if we forget the story or the
reason for the story, you could say,
then at some point the story starts to
break down. And you could say that what
we&#39;re seeing happening now all over
around us is the breakdown of the World
War II consensus. It&#39;s the breakdown of
the hold that that story has upon us.
uh it&#39;s something which it&#39;s not a it&#39;s
not even a moral question folks. It&#39;s
just something that at some point was
going to happen. Uh the question is when
it was going to happen and we can see it
kind of happening now and it&#39;s happening
in all kinds of guises. It&#39;s happening
at all these different levels. It&#39;s
happening in terms of the way that we
view ourselves. It&#39;s it&#39;s happening in
the way that politics is playing out in
the geopolitical vision of the map even
and how and what are the axes that are
holding things together. What are the
alliances that are holding uh the world
together? All of these are shaking right
now and uh and people are kind of
playing through this breakdown.
There are of course people that are
going to try to save it, you know, but
the problem is that in trying to save
it, you can extend it for a little
while, but there is a time in which it&#39;s
going to it&#39;s going to fail you because
the story of World War II is not
sufficient to hold the world together
because all sacred stories have taboos.
They have sacred places. they have uh
know certain uh things that you&#39;re not
allowed to touch you know because if you
touch them you make everything shake um
and that is what&#39;s happening now right
entire the entire story of the whole
Douglas Murray and uh Joe Rogan
discussions the Daryl Cooper situation
the Tucker Carlson situation the crisis
king question everything is kind of
shaking that story, you know.
And one of the things that we notice,
and it&#39;s important to notice it to kind
of understand also why things are
shaking the way they they are is
because because of the taboo of the end
of the war. Because it created a taboo
and it created a a a kind of secret. You
could say that the secret, it&#39;s not a
secret, but the deal that we made with
Stalin in order to win World War
II created a a a pattern, created a form
that led the world. What do I mean by
that? Which is it means that, you know,
my friend, you&#39;ve heard my friend Jordan
Peterson, I&#39;ve heard him several times
when, you know, saying, why do
communists get a pass in the West? Why
is it that, you know, the fascists and
the Nazis are are the devil and and
absolute evil and you can&#39;t invoke any
of their imagery. And not only can you
not invoke any of their imagery, but if
anyone is able to link anything you say
through one, two, three, four steps, as
many steps as you need it to fascism or
to Nazi imagery, even if it&#39;s not
directly, even if it&#39;s like this person
met this person met this person,
therefore you can&#39;t this first person he
talked about, you can&#39;t mention them
because they knew someone who knew
someone who knew someone who was a Nazi.
It&#39;s like, why is it that strong? and
the communists get a total pass. Why is
it that the communists their their
intellectuals fill the universities? Why
is it that uh you know even in terms of
imagery? Think about the uh trucker
protest in Canada was a great example.
You know, in the actual trucker protest,
someone came to the protest and brought
a Nazi flag. And the person, it seems
like the person was actually some kind
of Fed, was actually a policeman or some
kind of infiltrator that was there to
bring that flag into the protest so that
the media could talk about it
nonstop every day until the end of the
protest. And even though the people in
protest like told him to leave, you
know, got angry with this person and and
and he finally had to leave because
people around the him were getting
aggressive about him holding that flag.
It doesn&#39;t matter. The simple touching
like the infection of being connected to
that imagery was enough so that the main
story that the media went with was
saying they&#39;re all Nazis, right? Uh but
in the counterprotest of the trucker
protest, they had communist flags all
around. They had literal communist flags
in the counterprotest. Even though the
communist killed way more people than
the Nazis killed that the gulag
slaughtered more people that the the
communists although whether it&#39;s if you
join them all together especially the
Chinese the Russians the Vietnamese the
the the you know the Cambodians like all
of in Romania in in all the the the the
countries if you bring it together their
um their level of sustained slaughter
was much worse than the Nazis. Now,
obviously, I&#39;m not defending the N not
saying the Nazis are not as bad or
whatever. That&#39;s not the point. The
point is to to see that why is it that
that side is completely available, but
the other side, if you even touch if
you&#39;re even touched by their imagery,
you are completely destroyed. Uh, and
that&#39;s because of the secret. It&#39;s
because the secret of World War II. It&#39;s
it&#39;s because we made a deal with Stalin
in order to beat the Nazis and because
that there&#39;s a kind of taboo and there&#39;s
a pass for the for our for our allies
and it just happens. It&#39;s not it&#39;s not
even anybody doing it on purpose. It
just happens through natural narrative
causes you could say.
Um and so we have this problem, right?
And everybody has kind of experienced
this problem. uh you know which is that
itself as the time went on identity
itself whether it&#39;s gender identity in
terms of normal gender identity whether
it&#39;s national identity whether it&#39;s
ethnic identity uh any kind of tribal
right is in danger of being
called the the the Nazi like that&#39;s
that&#39;s how bad it was and we&#39;ve seen a
kind of encroaching. Anybody who lives
in the south of the United States will
have seen this. One of the things that
happened is that, for example, every
image of the south of the United States
is now equivalent to racism. And so no
matter what it is, the the Confederate
flag, Confederate images, Confederate uh
characters, you know, all of these
characters because they are 1 2 3 4 5 6
seven steps removed from the from the
sin of World War II, like the the idea
of how in the end what happened in World
War II was an excess of tyranny and
identity in the in the Germans. And we
made a deal with the anti-identity. We
meant it we made a deal with the with
the the communists that are kind of
revolutionary identity. We made a deal
with them in order to beat the the
tyranny of identity. Now everything that
is associated with normal identity is
associated with power. Anything that&#39;s
associated with normal identity becomes
associated with tyranny uh and
ultimately can be associated with Nazi.
And so that&#39;s why there&#39;s this like
slide and everybody&#39;s experienced that.
And everybody is kind of seeing that.
Now that is not a balanced portrayal of
reality, right? That can&#39;t hold. Like
that that cannot happen because what you
end up with is a rainbow tyranny, right?
You end up with a kind of
imposition of openness, right? Think of
Justin Trudeau that says openness is our
only value, right? We postnational
nations where we don&#39;t actually have a
nation. We are just openness to the
outside and we need indefinite migration
and we need indefinite immigrants you
know because our identity is actually
bad. We actually want secretly even
knowingly or unknowingly we want to
destroy identities. We want the whole
world to just be a giant soup that
doesn&#39;t have identity. Right? because of
this, all of this because of the myth of
World War II at first kind of holding
the world together in the in in a
beautiful way, but then ultimately that
story running its course and you could
say the side effects of the story,
right, the negative aspects of the story
started to play themselves out more and
more, more and more, more and more. Now
we end up in this
problem. And now what we&#39;re going to see
and we&#39;re going to see
the the breakdown of those taboss and
the breakdown of those myths and it&#39;s
going to happen in all kinds of ways
that are going to seem contradictory at
the outset. But if you pay attention,
you&#39;ll notice that that is what is going
to happen non-stop. And so and even
people who will hate each other will end
up playing out the breakdown of the
World War II consensus. Here&#39;s a simple
example. you know, a simple example to
show you how it&#39;s not as simple as you
think. So, right, Donald Trump is
elected president. He decides that all
of these national identities uh all
these kind of borders that exist that
they don&#39;t seem to matter to him. Like
he just wants to seems to think that he
can redefine them however he wants and
it and has this kind of uh populist uh
you know stance. And so, and he&#39;s being
accused, of course, of being a Nazi.
Obviously, that&#39;s how you do it. You
know, he&#39;s the devil. If he&#39;s bad, he&#39;s
the devil. If he&#39;s the devil, then it&#39;s
better to say he&#39;s the Nazi, to say that
he&#39;s Hitler rather than say that he is
the devil. Um, but that&#39;s playing out in
a way that people don&#39;t expect, which is
that in the actions that he&#39;s doing and
in saying to Canada, well, if you&#39;re a
postnational nation and you don&#39;t have
identity, why are you opposed to just
joining us? Like, why are you opposed to
just being taken over? Because you keep
saying that you don&#39;t have an identity.
You&#39;ve been saying that for 10 years and
so let&#39;s just take you in. I mean, you
don&#39;t care, right? You&#39;re just about
openness. And then the Canadians react
and they&#39;re like, &#34;No, our nation, we
are proud Canadians. We are proud
nationalists.&#34; And it&#39;s like, &#34;Oh my
goodness.&#34; Like, can you see what&#39;s
happening? Like, can you see that it&#39;s
all playing out? That no matter what you
do that the breakdown is is playing out.
Uh, and so it&#39;s just important to kind
of notice that. And so, you know, and
this is, of course, what Mr. West is
manifesting in his own confusion, in the
own kind of breakdown of his of his
world and in some ways in his desire to
transgress every single boundary and
transgress every single taboo. in his
kind of clown
contradiction, he
is grasping to reassimilate the imagery
of the of the of the World War II taboo.
Uh, and it&#39;s happening in all kinds of
chaotic ways. It&#39;s not just him. It&#39;s
happening all over the place. And it&#39;s
and it&#39;s it is in some ways an extremely
dangerous dangerous time. Um because if
we&#39;re not careful, obviously, you know,
we become, you could say, we become
Satanist to our little story. That is
that we we naively embrace the opposite
of the narrative and we think, &#34;Oh, no.&#34;
And you see it happening, right? You see
all these morons that they&#39;re like,
&#34;It&#39;s actually the Nazis that were
right.&#34; And they everything about them
was right and everything about what they
were doing was right. And it&#39;s like it&#39;s
like oh my goodness it&#39;s so tedious and
embarrassing which is why I don&#39;t like
to talk about it. uh you know but that&#39;s
the danger of what&#39;s coming is that is
that there has to be a way to
reintegrate this story in a manner that
won&#39;t let all the demons out of hell
that won&#39;t let all the demons that are
resentful and angry that have come to
realize because they have no place in
the current story that the anti-story is
actually the completely right one that
the anti- version of the story is the
right one. They&#39;re they&#39;re for all
intents and purposes they&#39;re like uh
let&#39;s say World War II metal heads,
right? World War II Satanist in that
sense where it&#39;s like the upside down
story is the right one. Uh but that is
that is not the right way to go. There
has to be a kind of reintegration so
that we can come back to uh a type of
synthesis. Now I don&#39;t know how that
reintegration happens. I don&#39;t know the
way to do it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s also my
job to do that. Um, but I&#39;m just warning
everyone that it is going to happen. And
what I hope is that it happens in the
least insane way, in a way that doesn&#39;t
provoke just an anti-story. Uh, which is
something that is that is definitely
Um because there are some things like a
little example like uh this is actually
the one of the best examples to kind of
understand how at some point the story
has the the the myth has to kind of re
reintegrated more completely into a
bigger story which is a good example the
swastika. It&#39;s
like the swastika is the most ancient
image. It&#39;s the most universal image.
one of the most universal images that
exists. It is found in every single
culture. It is found it is one of the
oldest images. You find it in in in uh
all over the world in thousands and
thousands of years ago, you know, 4,000
5,000 years uh before uh before Christ.
It&#39;s everywhere, you know. You can find
it in India, in South America. You can
find it in you can find it in uh in in
European churches. you find it
everywhere, you know, and
so so the Nazis capture this image,
right? And they use it for their
diabolical purpose, you know, but then
what happens is because they use it for
their diabolical purposes, then it&#39;s
it&#39;s captured. And so now this is a
scary image for how long? Forever. Like
this image that is the moon of the most
powerful images in the world is captured
by by these these these devils that is
not possible you know just that image at
some point has to break out because it&#39;s
bigger than the Nazis and it&#39;s bigger
than them and and and the the swastika
is kind of like a little example of how
things get this problem of like capture
and infection you
know the idea that
everything, how can I say this? Like the
idea that something if it&#39;s tainted, you
know, with the Nazis is now verbot in
forever. And you saw that happening like
all over all of a sudden it&#39;s like you
can&#39;t say this, you can&#39;t do this, all
these things you can&#39;t do. And you, if
you remember, like all the 4chan trolls
were playing jokes on this narrative
like they were doing that in 2016, 2017.
And they would, you know, if you if you
followed that, it was kind of funny.
They they started saying just to just to
provoke people that the okay sign like
this sign that Trump was doing, he was
always kind of doing this okay sign that
that meant white supremacy. Then
immediately when they said that the left
said no you can&#39;t do the okay sign
anymore because it&#39;s white supremacy.
And then they started saying that
drinking milk was like white
supremacist. And so then the left
started saying you can&#39;t use milk
anymore. Like drinking milk is racist,
you know. And it&#39;s like they were kind
of playing with this problem which is
that you know the the this weird capture
of the story that has had become a kind
of parody and that&#39;s the issue. I
remember watching a video when I was a
teenager. It really struck me there
there was a kind of more conservative uh
writer in France that was writing uh was
writing had created like a conservative
group and he was using the image of a
kind of dramatic image of a knight on a
horse that had been developed in the
middle ages you know and then the their
critics what did they say well they said
Germanic knight on a horse
huh you know that some Nazi at some time
point in the World War II used that
image image or use an image that looks
like it. And so are you a are you a
Nazi? You know, because you&#39;re using
that image. And it&#39;s like the guy was
like, &#34;What? This is a medieval image.&#34;
And it&#39;s like, &#34;No, it doesn&#39;t matter.
Doesn&#39;t matter. You can&#39;t use it.&#34; And
so that is not possible. You can&#39;t hold
the world prisoner forever. And you
can&#39;t hold European identity prisoner
forever. And you can&#39;t hold the swastika
prisoner forever. Like it just some
point has to be reintegrated. And the
question is how do we do it? What is the
best way to do it? Um, you
know, I have some ideas about that. I
don&#39;t know. Uh, it&#39;s a very, like I
said, it is nonetheless a very dangerous
time. And so, I would say be very
careful. Uh please don&#39;t take this in as
a kind of please if you&#39;re watching this
and you have a temp a temptation for the
anti-story in you please understand that
the anti-story is not the way to go.
What we need is a proper kind of
integration so that we can elevate this
into a new more powerful and more
encompassing story you know and it&#39;s
happened before you know it&#39;s
like the generals in the in the wars in
past some of the things that happened if
you take Alexander the great you know
Alexander the Great is a horrible
horrible man you know he he he the way
that he destroyed destroyed those that
resisted him even a little and just
raised their city to the ground and
salted the earth and just killed
everybody, all the men, all the women,
all the children. Like he&#39;s a monster,
you know. Uh and we can still say that
and but he has been reintegrated into
the story in a way that
recognizes, you
know, the the the effect that he had on
the world. also seeing all the
monstrosity that he&#39;s done uh and that
in some ways ultimately that is what is
going to have to happen to to the World
War II story. It doesn&#39;t mean that it
has to happen fast. It can happen
slowly. It can happen over decades. It
can happen over generations. But there
this is the inevitable way in which it
moves. Because if we try to hold on to
the taboo
forever, at some point that taboo, all
the all the demons that it&#39;s held at the
bottom, like all of this repression that
it&#39;s done, and that repression is a
repressed story, but it finds body in
those that are repressed. It finds body
in those that are marginalized and those
that are held outside of the narrative.
And so, it&#39;s not just a story. It&#39;s
embodied in people. So the the the the
angry, the resentful, those that see
that they have no stake in the story are
tempted and you can understand why to
embody the counter story to become
Satanist for all intents and purposes
for this little this particular story.
Um and so we can&#39;t let that we can&#39;t let
the satanic moment win. Uh and so we
have to find a better a better solution.
So that&#39;s my little thought on that. I
hope it is useful. Um these are very
difficult subjects to talk
about. Uh but I hope that I brought you
a little further on this reflection. And
so uh wishing everybody all the best and
I&#39;ll talk to you very soon. Bye-bye.
