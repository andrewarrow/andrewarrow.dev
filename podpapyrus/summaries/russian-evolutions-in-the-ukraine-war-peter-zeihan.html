Hey everybody, Peter Z here coming to
you from a humid Colorado afternoon,
which almost never happens. Anyway, uh
today we&#39;re going to talk about the
Ukraine war and where we are at the
moment. Um we&#39;ve had a significant shift
in the approach to the conflict by the
Russians. Too soon to say it&#39;s going to
be successful, but it&#39;s different enough
that it is worth exploring. uh instead
of doing what they call mass meat
assaults where you basically have throw
wave after wave after wave of humans
into a mix not really carrying how many
people get injured or killed trying to
grab specific positions incrementally.
We now have a position where the
Russians are doing small-cale
infiltration, sometimes as few as two
people at a time, just moving forward a
few yards at a time, parking for an
hour, and then continuing doing this all
across the front line. While up above we
have a change in the air war where the
Russians will not launch just a bunch of
drones, dozens, maybe even a couple
hundred at the same time along with some
missiles to saturate the air defense of
an area and then strike local urban
centers specifically going for power
systems but really any sort of logistics
support. Uh it&#39;s a very different
approach. It is generating results
although very very very incremental. I
don&#39;t want to overplay it but what has
driven the change are a couple of
things. Number one, uh, the Trump
administration is now starting to at
least in increments provide more
military assistance. The European
defense industries have been spinning up
for the last 3 years. They&#39;re getting
more artillery shells in the Ukrainian
hands, which is preventing the meat
assaults from having any impact. Uh, but
third, and most importantly, we&#39;re
seeing the Russians dust off an
industrial strategy that we have not
seen out of the Russians since the
For those of you who remember your World
War II history, you will remember that
one of the turning points in the Second
World War was when the Russians
developed enough industrial plant out of
reach of the Luftwafa, the the German
strategic bombers, so they could build
up all the industrial infrastructure and
military capacity that they needed
without having to worry about it getting
blown up from the sky. Uh this was
called the Euro strategy. Basically, the
Russians under Stalin built a series of
industrial cities out east of the
Eurals, well out of range of German
aircraft and built their military
capacity there and then shipped it into
the front. Uh there were obviously other
things could come into play. Lend lease,
the uh the invasion of Normandy, the
invasion of Sicily and ultimately
mainland Italy. All of these combined to
defeat the Nazis, but on the Russian
front, it was the Russians getting the
ability to build their own equipment
that really made the difference. We&#39;re
seeing some version of that now. Uh in
the war to this point, most of the
drones that the Russians have used have
either come from Iran or from China. Uh
largely already assembled. Maybe the
Russians have plugged in a warhead in
the front, but really that was about it.
The Russians were relying on industrial
capacity on the other side of an
international border to keep the flow
coming. And so they were using primarily
their old Soviet stockpile of equipment
of jeeps, of tanks, of ABCs, of
artillery, and so on. Well, 3 years on,
the Russians are running out of their
old Soviet large. All of the stuff that
was easily deployed, things that were
built in, say, the late &#39;7s and &#39; 80s
were long ago destroyed. They never
built enough of the more advanced things
that have been built since 1992 to make
a strategic difference, and most of
that&#39;s been destroyed. And then they
started going back into their older
stocks, uh, weapon systems from, say,
the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s that
were just wildly out ofd, didn&#39;t even
have things like optics, but that meant
that putting optics in them was
relatively straightforward. So all of a
sudden, we saw these 1950s aeros tanks
coming out with like 1990s optics. All
those been destroyed. that has left them
with equipment that was built in the 70s
and early 80s that had optics, but it&#39;s
crappy Soviet optics and it all has to
be ripped out and then replaced. That
takes more time per tank and the end
result is just a trickle of equipment
that comes in and they&#39;re now burning
through that, too. Basically, 70 years
of Soviet stockpiling is almost gone.
And now they&#39;re reliant on equipment
that has either come in from elsewhere,
like say artillery shells from North
Korea, or this new stuff. The new stuff
is very different.
The Russian military is an artillery
force and now that they&#39;ve lost a lot of
their artillery, they&#39;re having to
reinvent on the fly. And what they&#39;re
doing is taking that old Euro strategy
of building industrial plant behind the
Eurals and marrying it to the drone
tech. So we now have multiple facilities
in Russia proper that are manufacturing
Iranian Shahed drones. Now Shahed drones
are pretty dumb. They&#39;re basically dumb,
slowmoving, low warhead cruise missiles.
And the original ones and the ones that
make up even today the bulk of the
Russian effort don&#39;t even have GPUs.
They&#39;re incapable of making decisions in
any meaningful way. You basically just
plug in where you want them to go. Maybe
you give them the route to get there and
then off they go. Uh which incidentally
means that anytime they strike a school,
it&#39;s automatically a war crime because
they had to program that in. Anyway, uh
we&#39;re now starting to see a second
generation starting to produced also get
produced in Russia, uh that has some
GPUs, uh Jetson chips from Nvidia
specifically that probably run $600 to
$900 a pop. So, these are larger drones
with bigger warheads, but they also have
some primitive decision-making
capability. These like 8 nanometer
chips, far from cutting edge, but an
order of magnitude better than what
they&#39;ve been using at this point. But
the bottom line is these things are not
being built in Iran and shipped into
Russia for use. They&#39;re being built in
Russia and that adds a step of
complication to anyone who wants to
interrupt the supply chain because it&#39;s
no longer foreign. The same thing is
happening with Chinese equipment. It
used to be that the Chinese would ship
in more or less fully assembled drones
and then the Russians might make a
couple modifications before deploying
them. Now the Chinese are shipping in
lots of components still, but the
Russians are doing most of the assembly
in Russia proper. again outside of the
reach of any sort of Ukrainian strike
capability.
And that means that the Russians are not
simply getting more autonomy in their
military-industrial complex, they&#39;re
also getting a bigger feed through
because they&#39;re still buying the Finnish
stuff from both China and Iran. So
instead of using a few drones a day or a
few dozen drones a day, there have been
a number of attacks where they&#39;re using
a few hundred drones a day. And one of
the things that they&#39;ve gotten really
good at is not even putting a warhead in
some of these things and not putting any
advanced chips in some of them. So maybe
maybe as many as 2/3 of the drones that
the Russians are firing at targets are
actually just decoys that are very very
very cheap. And so if Ukraine is using
their limited air defense to try to
clear the skies and they have to deal
with literally hundreds of spoofed
signals and false targets, more and more
of the real things will get through. And
the Russians are now starting to
coordinate the timing of these drone
assaults with their missile attacks. And
the result has been a lot more damage to
infrastructure
uh in Ukraine uh including civilian
infrastructure in urban zones. You
combine these with things like say glide
bombs which the Russians have no
shortage of and you&#39;re talking about the
Russians being able to completely
obliterate what we would traditionally
think of as a front line and just make
this mess of shifting no man&#39;s lands
where those incremental one and two guys
at a time can move 50 ft at a time and
from time to time find a soft spot and
get enough numbers forward that they can
actually more a more traditional
assault. It is way too soon to say that
this is going to work. And of course,
the Ukrainians will have to adapt to it
by making their own changes, but we have
seen a significant shift in the way that
the Russians are prosecuting the war.
And with the technologies involved
changing day by day, week by week, month
by month, that is absolutely worth
