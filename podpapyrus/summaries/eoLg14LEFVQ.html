Everying Gen Z and Gen Alpha kid in the
world in 24 months will see a video and
have noing clue if it&#39;s a person or an
AI influencer. Almost every person in
this room has already seen an AI
influencer that they have no clue as an
AI influencer. Of course, I know the
ones that are super obvious and like all
that you see on Instagram, you have seen
AI influencers that you do not realize
are not people. And like that&#39;s today&#39;s
tech. In 24 months, it&#39;s game over. I
hope that leads to you doing 5 hours of
homework. I believe you will see how
real what I just said is. And now that
allows you a 24-month window to decide
what you want to do with that
information. I believe over the last 70
years of marketing, working media
dollars have been used to disguise bad
And I believe that we are now living in
the era of working media dollars being
used to amplify good creative. And I do
not believe our industry is actually
doing that. And I want to talk about
that and compel people to understand how
real this is. Um it sits in a classic
marketing framework which is a lot of
people have been in the mindset of paid
owned earned and I believe we&#39;re
actually living in the owned earned paid
era. And so what that means if I put
into English for some of the
entrepreneurs here or salespeople,
very simply put,
very simply put, I believe any Fortune
5000 company that is not remarkably
overinvesting in organic social media
creative is making a fundamental
strategic mistake.
Because the way we sit today with these
seven social networks is that when you
put out creative, they are fully running
a model that is based on relevance. And
for the people that love the old school
marketing books, good news. I agree with
you. Relevance creates consideration.
Consideration leads to people buying.
The fact that we have at scale the
biggest tech companies in the world,
Google, Shorts, Meta, Facebook and
Instagram, Tik Tok, Bite Dance, Tik Tok,
the biggest marketing companies in the
world, the biggest tech infrastructures
in the world have algos when we post on
social that are desperate for that
content to reach an audience that&#39;s
actually interested in it so that you
all stay on the platform so they can
sell more ads is the greatest
opportunity for marketers ever.
For the first time in marketing history,
the creative creates reach. That&#39;s
insane. And it creates reach based on
relevance. For 70 years, we have been
guessing in boardrooms through our egos
and our politics on what the campaign or
commercial should be and then spend an
ungodly amount of money disguising that
it was probably a piece of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
And now we can post at scale with
content that is relevant, see that human
beings, not us in the industry, care
about it and have the ability to amplify
it or campaign on top of it. I believe a
paid owned earned model is broken. In
fact, every business that I own, the
ones that are on that screen or anything
that I&#39;m the chairman of the board of or
a very disproportionate investor in, has
in 2025 gone to a model where we do not
spend one dollar of working media until
it has been affirmed organically on
social. There is actually, if I may,
with all due respect, zero reason to
spend media dollars amplifying any piece
of creative that has not been affirmed
with organic reach in 2025. Yet, 99.9%
of the brands represented here and
agencies will do such.
I don&#39;t know what else to say. It&#39;s
black and white. the VC, the ecosystem
of entrepreneurs in here, the companies
that are going from zero to $50 million
a year in revenue are only living in a
social organic first framework.
And then there&#39;s us.
I beg our industry, I know the financial
reasons we&#39;re not doing this. I get it.
I get the agency stuff. I get the brand
stuff. I get the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] reports that
justify all our behavior in this
industry from the MM and the MMAs and
everything else. I get it.
But there is not one [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] person in
here that has a half a brain that
doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m 100% right. And it
is time we act as much because for my
fellow agency friends, how many people
here work at an agency? Raise your
hands. For my fellow friends, I do not
view us competing. I view us as an
industry in a crisis where if we do not
prove value, we will not exist.
There&#39;s a reason shit&#39;s going in-house.
It&#39;s cuz we [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] suck.
Thank you everybody. I&#39;ll see you later.
For the first, by the way, for the first
time ever, brands agency friends, we can
measure creative.
Creative does not get views in social if
it is not good. I don&#39;t care what your
opinion is or what color of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
fugia you like or what adjective makes
you get going or what&#39;s on brand from
something written a 100 years ago. If it
doesn&#39;t get views, it is not good.
Good is defined as views achieved
organically, nothing else. We are here.
I&#39;m sorry to tell you I am also mad. I
also desperately wish that this was the
Don Draper 1950s. I would drink tons of
alcohol in Midtown Manhattan. I&#39;m
charismatic as [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and I can sell my
ass off. I would have [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] crushed
But we&#39;re not here. And the level of
in creative that everybody is trying to
run away from is not going anywhere. So
either we learn the new craft, which is
knowing how to make creative that
actually gets views, not the production
value of an $800,000 video that nobody&#39;s
going to watch
or we will die. Both the agencies and
the brands. And that is where we&#39;re at.
And now I would like to open my Q&amp;amp;A.
Thank you.
[Applause]
you&#39;ve spoken about most recently, first
time I heard it was on a LinkedIn live
interview back in November about the
paradigm shift of social media is now
interest media
where content is not being pushed by
algorithms to people who are connected
to you, but it&#39;s being pushed to people
who have that interest that connects
with that piece of content. The to your
point Elliot, the entire rant that I
just went through, there is no doubt in
my mind that we are no longer in the
social media era. We are fully in the
interest media era. We are standing up
accounts that have no followers and
getting more views on our content than
the accounts that have a million
followers.
It&#39;s over. Go ahead.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m so happy that I was able to set that
up for you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, sir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My question is, what does the industry
do? What are you doing
to track it authentically, accurately?
Vanity metrics, it all can be
manipulated. Now that we&#39;re in going,
we&#39;re in a range of interest media where
you if someone&#39;s interested in it,
they&#39;re shoving the content to them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s a Let me jump in since we&#39;re
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Mirax,
a brand we work on, which normally gets
300 views on its creative before we
started working with it, had a video the
other day that got 36 million views.
Immediately,
in the next 72 hours, miraculously,
stunningly, its Amazon rank went from
four whatever some absurd number 437,000
to in the thousands. They sold an
obnoxious amount of product.
Elliot, the only thing Vayner Media has
been measuring for the 15 years we&#39;ve
been in this industry is sales.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, sales doesn&#39;t come immediately
sometimes, and you got to figure all
that out. And I&#39;m very empathetic that I
I will forever die on this hill.
Measuring brand is like measuring love
and God. It&#39;s not going to be a black
and white thing. But again, for the
people in this room that are paying
attention to the miraculous things that
have happened to Chili&#39;s restaurant or
Abocrabby and Fitch, there is a 100%
correlation to organically earned views
and business results.
Not posting a piece of crap on social
media and spending media dollars to
amplify it to give it a million views.
No, no, no. Organically earned views
lead to sales. And Elliot, the reason
everyone in this room will be on this
bandwagon is because the data is black
and white to the sales. And that will be
too compelling to ignore no matter how
much some in this room want to hold on
to yesterday.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Same thing with Ocean Spray. You&#39;ve
talked about the mango gummies. Crazy
moments. There&#39;s every day on social, on
Tik Tok and Instagram, there is a video
that is going viral that is creating
more financial impact on brands than
every TV commercial that that brand has
run in the last several years. It&#39;s just
real life. Again, we can continue to
live as if not. We continue to fight for
things we make more margin on or what
our company does for a living that does
not map to this. But it doesn&#39;t make it
any less true.
And I do believe the walls are closing
in on us. And that&#39;s it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then leading into the creator
economy, and I&#39;ll finish with this so I
can sit down and give other people a
chance, is super fans, right? Everyone
wants to know and identify who their
super fans are.
How do you see that growing that you can
be able to identify it, not to
manipulate it, but to quantify it and to
be able to do something with it
authentically?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean I think look people
will continue to build CRM. There&#39;s tons
of startups. There&#39;s, you know, new
startups like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and others that are
giving you the data instead of it being
owned by the social networks. The
blockchain is an incredibly important
technology that will continue to grow.
You know that that data I feel more
comfortable that this room has mapped or
has optionality. Um the question is how
many people understand that their heavy
users or their super fans are actually a
disproportionate impact on their
business. that gets a little blurry, but
the ability to identify and manage and
engage, those pipes are in place.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, brother.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, hey, Gary. Thanks so much for the
time. I really appreciate it. Um, what&#39;s
your name?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My name is Jacob Wallik. I run a a
social first uh consultancy called
Social for the Win.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m also a creator. Uh, I have about
500,000 followers on TikTok. I teach
Microsoft Excel in a fun, sassy way with
my character Excel Daddy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No need to call me daddy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m thrilled to call you daddy, Jacob.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely. I love it. Um, you know, I I
think what you&#39;re saying is incredibly
on on point. You know, relevancy,
relatability, organic first obviously
being such an important thing for a lot
of brands, but I feel like we look at
brands like Duolingo as as the, you
know, the case study to determine what&#39;s
successful in terms of organic. But if
you look at the spectrum of social, not
every brand can do outrageous and
ridiculous content and move at the speed
of sound like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I agree.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How do you see brands building more
evergreen organic creative strategy with
more tenpole creative moments that they
can then optimize on? Because I feel
like from my side, most brands are
really not focused on that. They don&#39;t
see the value. I I agree that there is a
ton of value, but how are you
positioning it as a way to drive
relevancy to stay in the game and build
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; by doing again, you know, it&#39;s fun to
now be so part of this industry because
I have years now, not just thesis by
doing what we&#39;ve always done. We&#39;ve
never told a client that virality is the
punchline. We believe that getting five
and 10,000 views every day, three, four,
five times a day on four different
platforms adds up. And the math supports
us again because we played outside the
matrix of reporting and have asked our
clients to judge us on the health of
their business at the end of our
relationship. We&#39;ve been willing to lose
and win on business results. Obviously,
that often times has led us to try to
get the media and the creative together
so we could be fully held accountable.
So, obviously, when we don&#39;t have one or
the other, it&#39;s a little bit harder for
us to fully play on that. But now just
on organic social creative, we&#39;re able
to prove our merit because of what we&#39;re
talking about here. So honestly, it&#39;s
just about truthtelling.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When we pitch a client, we&#39;re not like
Vayner is going to make you go viral.
We&#39;re like we are going to get more
views per day across the board. Here&#39;s
the big one for all the business people
here because we make such a high volume
of creative as a creative agency. We&#39;re
also a production company. We don&#39;t come
up with an idea and pay someone else to
make it. So for the same price that
they&#39;re accustomed to paying a creative
agency, they get creative and production
output daily. And because we&#39;re
producing so much creative, we&#39;re able
to win on relevance. When I look at the
crowd here that I can see in the front
rows, for me to sell Ocean Spray or or a
Excel course or these sneakers, I need a
lot of different content to get
everyone. I got different genders,
races, interest, income levels. I need
relevance at scale with as many
different consumers as possible to
actually grow my business. I love
marketing because it&#39;s offense for
business. This is business for me. I&#39;m
not trying to win some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] headline
in a magazine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so to me, we just tell them the
truth. This is what you&#39;re currently
doing. This is how you&#39;re wasting your
money. You&#39;re buying you&#39;re buying
potential reach, not actualized reach. I
believe in reach and frequency, too. But
you need the reach to be seen. This
industry is very good at buying fake
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah. And and I just said one other
quick thing. So, you know, if you look
at companies in the gaming space and in
the sports space, they have a ton of IP,
right? Even just like traditional media,
like look at Family Guy or South, there
are people who are literally just out
there clipping content on a continuous
basis, putting it on social, and it&#39;s
it&#39;s basically free views for brands,
right? Without them having to do
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, that&#39;s intellectual property is
the beast of the game, for sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely. But how do you look at
brands who don&#39;t necessarily have that
intellectual property like maybe within
the CPG space or you know within home
home and personal goods and give just
general creators the opportunity to put
out content for them. Like how do you
position that or how do you tell them
hey you need to create different types
of IP to then let your audience kind of
take control and push it out there for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Brother, I&#39;m just trying to get them to
give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about social.
Like yes, we have those conversations,
but the reality is is that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for example, if this is day one and if
this gentleman&#39;s the CEO or CMO of
Reebok, my opening or or Dr. Pepper, my
opening line is 20% of your entire
marketing budget of the entire marketing
budget, not the creative budget. 20% of
your entire marketing budget needs to be
allocated for social creative
production.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For a company like a Dr. Pepper that
spends I&#39;m going to make this up. I have
no clue. But if they&#39;re spending 100
million, I&#39;m asking for 20 million in
fee for social production and they&#39;re
spending 500,000 a year. We&#39;ve got a
long way to go for this ecosystem to
understand how much they&#39;re getting
outflanked by much smaller brands. Much
smaller brands than the Fortune 500
brands in here are spending 3 to 4x in
real money on social creative. They
don&#39;t even understand what&#39;s happening.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so before I get them to think about
IP or resurrecting the jolly green giant
or doing smart [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] or understanding
what [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is or all this stuff, I need
them to even understand they&#39;re not even
in the game financially. You have
multi-billion dollar companies getting
outspent in the most important channel
in marketing today 5 to1 by a brand that
didn&#39;t exist a year ago because they
want to spend $900,000 throwing a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] party at possible.
[Applause]
Thank you. Go Jets.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Go Jets.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey Gary, my name is Scott. Thanks for
all the pep talks over the years

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Like that. in house. We own Iowa
Chill and the Midwest verse everybody
social media brands and we focus on

virtual influencers and reaching Gen Z.
Uh Gen Z is notoriously hard to get to
trust. And I&#39;m curious if you know
anything about how they will perceive
virtual influencers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, they won&#39;t know the difference.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Won&#39;t know the difference. Every [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Gen Z and Gen Alpha kid in the world in
24 months will see a video and have no
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] clue if it&#39;s a person or an AI
influencer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s that&#39;s and and that based this is
why I&#39;m glad you asked the question
because what I get excited about is my
biggest belief, brother, and you&#39;re a
young entrepreneur is put yourself out
of business before someone else does it.
If you do your homework, don&#39;t take me
for an answer, but if you do your own
homework, it sounds like you have a
little context on me given the way you
started this conversation. If I&#39;ve got
any credibility with you, I hope that
leads to you doing 5 hours of homework
the way I&#39;ve done 50 hours of homework
on this subject matter. I believe you
will see how real what I just said is.
And now that allows you a 24-month
window to decide what you want to do
with that information. Do you want to
build your own AI infrastructure? Do you
not? Like, and that&#39;s why I want you to
know it. But I promise you right now,
almost every person in this room has
already seen an AI influencer that they
have no clue as an AI influencer. Of
course, I know the ones that are super
obvious and like all that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that you
see on Instagram, you have seen AI
influencers that you do not realize are
not people. And like that&#39;s today&#39;s
tech. In 24 months, it&#39;s game game over.
[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, Gary. Um, I&#39;m going to go to the
opposite side of the demographic. What&#39;s
your name? My name is April and I have a
startup agency called Openly Gray.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so we are working with the brands to
focus on the gray market 50 plus
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; love.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I realize that a lot of brands are
sleeping on them and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sleeping
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and uh you know there&#39;s the great wealth
transfer that&#39;s about to happen but
these people are still alive and
thriving and they are holding the purse
strings. So I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] 50.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
I I always laugh at this like people
live to 90. You know that, right,
everybody? Like they&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] 50,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Have you seen 50 year olds recently?
They all act like they&#39;re 27.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;re 50. They&#39;re definitely not gray.
They&#39;re all [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] coloring their hair.
What are we talking about here?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Keep going.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, I just wanted to know your
perspective on uh any advice for brands
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to stop being idiots. They have the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and we call openly gray.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I understand. Facebook blue.
Facebook right this second of the seven
social networks that I most obsess over
and their algorithms is
disproportionately the most interesting
one to market on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, absolutely.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is an ungodly amount of attention
at scale on Facebook blue from 45 to 70
and they buy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
What would I tell brands? Be a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
How would you like I&#39;m aware that we&#39;ve
become youth obsessed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I love a good Gen Alpha as much as the
next one,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but like when you&#39;re a big brand for how
many people here are working for a
Fortune 500 or are an agency that works
with Fortune 500? Just raise your hands.
Just hi if you don&#39;t mind. Thank you.
Like at that scale, we need to sell to
everyone. Of course, there&#39;s going to be
certain products that don&#39;t match. I
mean, if you&#39;re selling to elder, like
diapers for elderly people, like
20-year-olds might not necessarily, but
I just I what I love is that our
industry lacks a severe level of common
sense. What would I tell brands? If you
want somebody to buy your product that&#39;s
50 to 80, market to them with content
that they would like to see and maybe
buy your product in places they spend
their time. Oh, by the way, they [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
live on Facebook.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely. Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, I&#39;m Kit Huffman. I&#39;m building an
agency. We do content communications for
startup tech.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amazing. I my question is just I think
what is so inspiring about your career
and just the agency that you&#39;ve built is
that it it&#39;s compet you&#39;re you&#39;re up
playing with some of the biggest
marketing agencies and you are in just
like you said 15 years competing with
some of the biggest marketing agencies
and just me myself as a founder like me
having so much excitement and also like
anxiety about like I feel so excited
about what I am building
what point or if you could just maybe
walk us through like what were the
emotions that you were maybe feeling
when you were like first starting off or
what was like maybe there was a turning
point or a moment that you&#39;re like I&#39;m
not just building another marketing
agency I&#39;m going to build like one of
the biggest [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] marketing agencies.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um thank you and good luck. I would
here&#39;s what I would tell you based on
what I understand you&#39;re asking me. The
reason the things worked out the way
they did for us is
I built an internal culture that was
focused on one very important nuance
that this industry has done very poorly,
which is I as the founder and the owner
desperately cared more that the people
in my agency cared about each other than
the clients.
Advertising agencies are really bad at
over bending to keep the business and
doing [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] they don&#39;t believe in. I was
willing to be patient. I knew that what
we were focusing on was going to take
more and more market share and I was
willing to leave a lot of money on the
table and a lot of lumps on the table in
the first 5 to 10 years to get to a
place where I thought we were stronger
grounded on continuity. every how many
people work at agencies? Raise your
hand. So, this crew knows like the
average time someone spends at an agency
is non-existent. We have almost 100
people that have been at the company for
over 10 years of a 15 person 15 year
company. I really thought that if I
could keep continuity
with people that we would have speed and
trust and I just didn&#39;t compromise for
you to build what you want to build it&#39;s
going to be about you not compromising
to get the money in the short term and I
think agencies do a poor job with that
and they become you know they always say
agencies are always like I don&#39;t want to
be like a vendor I want to be a partner
to be a partner you have to speak your
truth and too many agencies bite their
tongue PS to keep the next check coming,
which ironically is why they lose the
client in the end.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can I ask one follow-up? How did you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; how did you find your truth? Especially
when you were starting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m a practitioner. I&#39;m not like these
I what we sell at Vayner Media, I do
today. I wrote the copy for the social
media post that you saw if you follow
me. My truth was very different. I was
selling something I already did and
continue to do to this day.
The skill in getting views in social
through your thumbnail, the first three
seconds, the copy and the overall piece
of creative, whether in picture, written
or video form is the most complicated
and most important skill in marketing
today. I do that every day for not only
Gary Vee, but for wine text, for V
friends. I am the practitioner CEO of my
company. I am not in one meeting in my
company where I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going
on better than everybody else in that
room. That is unheard of in this
industry. The CEOs I compete with live
in France and are bankers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My question is where does podcasting
come into play when it comes to both
agencies advising large brands and large
brands that are trying to figure it all
out? Because in our experience over the
past decade of helping people figure out
how to get into the world of podcasting
and where their role is with it, they&#39;re
they&#39;re just wildly confused and lost
and and a majority of them are we don&#39;t
need that. We&#39;re not really a media
company. I know you&#39;ve been preaching
the podcast gospel for quite some time
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have some good news for you. There&#39;s a
tipping point going on. I&#39;ve spoken to
more B2B companies in the last six
months about them finally doing their
own podcasts as a production day for the
social creative they need for LinkedIn
than I have in the last seven years.
That&#39;s where I would focus.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The future&#39;s bright.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The future&#39;s bright if you&#39;re able to
communicate to everyone in here that the
podcast is the added value. It&#39;s
actually a production day for creative.
I would argue that the people in this
room that are in experiential are in the
same place. I would argue today that
every experiential execution in
marketing is actually a production day
for social creative and when you mix
that together it becomes very ROI
positive. I would position it that way.
If you tell them we&#39;re not doing a
podcast, we&#39;re doing a a couple of
production days for creative and you
happen to get the podcast for free, I
feel like you&#39;re going to get a very big
audience. What does it look like for the
world of bisdev and sales though for
opening up doors when I&#39;m trying to get
a coffee with you that may not be
available but if I invite you to a
interview on Zoom
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know how I&#39;ve said this this has
been forever when you do when you host
the party you win when you start a
podcast and invite your clients that you
want on it. It always works. You&#39;ve
replicated something just now that I&#39;ve
been talking about for a decade. It
works. I&#39;ve watched it time and time
again. And for anybody in here, and
there&#39;s a lot of salespeople running
around Miami right now, for a lot of you
that will spend the money to come down
here and shoot your shots and make your
decks and try to bisdev and sponsor
stuff and cocktail hours, if that money
and energy went into a podcast around
the industry that you&#39;re in and you
invited these CMOs that you&#39;re so
desperate to meet downstairs
as guests, you would have them captive
for two hours.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, brother. Love you, man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
Hi Gary, great seeing you this year as
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pleasure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh so I&#39;m Russell Karim. Uh we built a
company, we built a AI powered company
to uh streamline the supply chain for
uniform and promotional product industry
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For what brother?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For so we built a AI powered uh
technology to streamline uniform and
promotional product industry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very cool. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um so I know you know just listening to
you all these years you talk about live
selling. I mean so much about the live
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you think like this geopolitical
influence on social platforms or even
the global supply chain? How does that
impact that future of live e-commerce?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Look politics. I mean I love what I
don&#39;t so I was a terrible student but I
was really good at history. I you know
I&#39;m fascinated by people who don&#39;t know
anything about history. I don&#39;t know if
you know this but there&#39;s always [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
going on between countries.
Like like we act like this trade war
between us and China is some like
unheard of phenomenon. You [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
ever hear about the cold war?
Do you know that your grandparents never
went to Eastern Europe for 70 years? You
couldn&#39;t go to Poland or the USSR? Like
this. Like what do I think? I think it&#39;s
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] life.
Like I I don&#39;t even think about that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Like if it&#39;s more expensive, you
either pass it on to the customer or you
take the hit. That&#39;s called business.
During COVID, we pass it on to the
customer. Right now, the prices with
inflation are too high. So, everybody
with supply chain is taking the hit. So,
they&#39;re cutting cost, firing people,
spending less on marketing. This is
business 101. Live shopping to me, maybe
why you&#39;re bringing it up is live
shopping happened in China 10 years ago.
It is a good dollar industry in China.
It will be the same in the Western
world. Tik Tok shop and whatnot and soon
to follow eBay and Facebook and
Instagram and everybody else. The
QVCification of social media is here. It
is a massive opportunity for the people
in this room who are like not in love
what they do for a living. Raise your
hand if you get your job real quick.
Just curious.
Yeah, I know your boss is here. Um
I was just trying to get you. Um,
for the half of you that actually hate
your job, even though none of you raised
your hand, if you&#39;re looking for an
opportunity that might be interesting to
you, I could not push you more to do
some homework on live social shopping.
There&#39;s some really fascinating human
dynamics in live social shopping. I
think there&#39;s a subculture subconscious,
excuse me, tipping mechanism. So, people
spend more because they&#39;re actually
being entertained. So, they end up
buying stuff almost like a tip. There&#39;s
been I&#39;ve been really studying it. I&#39;ve
been in it now for about a year very
deeply many many many many hours. I
believe live social shopping is one of
the most interesting things. But that is
a separate completely different thing
than supply chain like realities. That&#39;s
just that&#39;s always going to hap. There&#39;s
always going to be something bro, right?
Like Japan had a financial crisis in the
80s and it [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] it up because we were
all in on Japan. And [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] 2008 crisis
happened in 1987 in October the stock
market collapsed and the junk bonds and
in 197 people are like it&#39;s never been
worse. I&#39;m like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in 1979.
Gas stations had no gas.
Like I don&#39;t understand. Like you let me
just This is a per I know I&#39;m over time.
This is a perfect thing to I apologize
to everybody in line. Feel free to. My
phone number is right there if you want
to text me your question. I&#39;m flying to
Toronto tonight. I&#39;m happy to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
answer it. I&#39;m just going to leave you
with this.
We have it so good that we think it&#39;s
We complain about dumb [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Everyone&#39;s like, &#34;It&#39;s never been worse.
The black plague was worse.
That Holocaust thing was no [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Like World War II was messy.
We are just so fortunate that we&#39;re
around to complaining about dumb [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
People talk about like, &#34;I don&#39;t make 10
million a year. I&#39;m broke.&#34; We&#39;ve lost
our [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] way, friends.
In marketing for damn sure, but even in
life. So, I think we need to be more
grateful, more grounded, less
materialistic, more humble. The fact
that you&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] breathing is a win.
We need to calm the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] down. We got to
stop using Thank you.
[Applause]
We need to desperately,
desperately stop weaponizing words.
You&#39;re not anxious, you&#39;re
inconvenienced.
Like we have really [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] our [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up.
We&#39;ve created new words. I have imposter
syndrome. You&#39;re insecure.
We didn&#39;t need another word.
So, let&#39;s just be grateful and let&#39;s
bring common sense and gratitude back.
It&#39;ll be good for your life and it will
make all of you much better marketers
cuz our industry is full of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
You do not need to make TV commercials
that cost millions of dollars and then
spend millions of dollars to amplify it.
The world has moved on. I&#39;m sorry.
We bought buying the lowest cost
programmatic CPMs. I don&#39;t know if you
heard this. You get what you&#39;re paying
for. You get excited about $3 CPMs. It&#39;s
on [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] mommy.org
below the fold banner ad on the right.
It&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] garbage.
And don&#39;t get me started with principal
buying and all the other [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] we make up
to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] make margin that&#39;s good for
the agency and not for the brands. We
need a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] wakeup call as humans and
definitely as a advertising industry.
Otherwise, it&#39;s going to be much worse
than you think. So, I ask all of you to
have the courage to start telling the
truth and start getting educated on
what&#39;s really going out out there
because that will be good for everyone
and I thank you for your time and I wish
you the best possible ever. Thank you.
Thank you.
