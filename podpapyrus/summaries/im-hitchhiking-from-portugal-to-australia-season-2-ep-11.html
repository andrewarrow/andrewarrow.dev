I&#39;m hitchhiking from Portugal to
Australia.
I started hearing as some people go
around. Now, at the end, he was like
asking for a case and stuff, grabbing my
leg. I&#39;m going to pass this video to a
computer, delete everything from the
phone cuz they do a phone check.
I spent the first three weeks crossing
Europe, but now I was stepping into a
new continent. Today marks the beginning
of this new season, one with many ups
and downs, a lot of adventure, and a
completely new set of challenges to
So the past four days it&#39;s been like
visiting a bit in Sabul but to be honest
mostly resting and editing. Today I
don&#39;t have like an exact plan. I really
feel like I want to be alone for a bit.
So I will try to hit to a bit on the
west coast uh like whatever I can get
My plan for the next days was very
abstract. I had further to get to
Antalya where my sister would join me
for one week and a half. I wanted to go
to a few beaches, but I didn&#39;t really
have a routine in mind. I just wanted to
go with the flow and let the road lead
the adventure. Will you look at these? I
might have just found myself.
Looks good. The first step and most
difficult one was leaving. Hitchhiking
in big cities is always tricky, but I
didn&#39;t want to spend more money on
buses. So, I walked quite a lot and
dusted two different hitchhiking spots.
Yet, no one was picking me up. Okay. So,
I spent like quite a long time uh
waiting for a ride. Everyone was making
signs also that they were going to
another place. So, I ended up writing uh
OPET which is like the name of a gas
station. Like after I wrote OPET, a guy
stopped like after 5 minutes. I think
the gas station was only a few
kilometers further. But from here, I
knew I could talk to people and get a
ride more easily.
You want to sit behind or front?
I can put the bag behind and I sit in
the front.
You may have water.
Okay. Thank you.
You&#39;re welcome, please. This is European
sides. This is Anatolian sides. We don&#39;t
say Asian side. Anatolia is an English
word as well, but
kind of like belongs to you. Uh
traditional places something. But I
don&#39;t suggest you to take other stuff in
Turkey. Actually a lot of people say
it&#39;s a very good country too to be
it is it is but you know sometime you
may meet people they&#39;re not good too.
Yeah. Yeah.
So you know
yeah that&#39;s a bit
I don&#39;t know it is everywhere right?
Everywhere I go I am warned about bad
people and almost everyone associates
hitchhiking with something really
dangerous. However my experiences with
this lifestyle like the vast majority of
hitchhikers have shown me exactly the
opposite. Seeing so many people help and
sometimes go completely out of their way
for a complete stranger gives me a lot
of hope in this world. Ultimately,
hitchhiking has taught me that the world
is way safer than most people think. And
it has allowed me to see the world as my
home. So the guy that led me here,
Khalil, he told me the the two first
digits of the flight number of each car.
They say like where they are from. So
from 34, for Ismir it&#39;s 35, for Bura
it&#39;s 60. So yeah, now I&#39;m trying to look
into that. I started asking people if
they were going towards Bura or Ismir,
but almost everyone was going just to
the next village or in the direction of
I&#39;ve been asking around for almost I
don&#39;t know 40 minutes already. Not
having any luck.
I just going to have like what I cooked
in uh Yammon&#39;s house in orange. And
yeah, guys, this is how you travel tip.
You just cook for yourself and that&#39;s
I then went back to work and usually I
only show you the more straightforward
parts of me approaching people but the
truth is many of the interactions I have
I either don&#39;t understand or they are
kind of awkward you go there
okay thank you
are you perhaps going in the direction
you go
Ah, so I Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Hi. Are you okay?
Are you?
But thankfully, it only takes one car.
Got the right to second.
The driver didn&#39;t want to talk much and
I had a rest ride, which I actually
appreciated a lot. He also drove through
national roads instead of the highway.
So, it took a lot longer. And as it was
already getting a bit late, I asked him
to drop me off a bit before Bura to
So, yeah. Now, I I still need to walk
quite a bit till I get to the beach. But
I will just try to put my time out and
see if someone picks me up. But if it&#39;s
necessary, it&#39;s like one hour walk.
Soon after I started walking, two
aggressive dogs came out of nowhere and
I was lucky to quickly get a car.
They were like going uh to the cars.
And then they started looking at me and
I was a bit afraid.
These dogs attacked some people before.
Okay. Okay. Yeah. They didn&#39;t my
So now they dropped me off at the
village. I&#39;m near a beach, but like this
is not the beach where I want to stay.
This is like a very small beach.
My plan was to go to a small market to
buy some fruits and veggies, then go to
the beach and find a nice place to set
up camp. However, there were also two
mosques in the village. And I kind of
wanted to sleep at a mosque for some
time now. So that was my plan B. And so
I was going in the direction of the
market. Uh I started like 2 minutes
after a guy stopped asking where I
wanted to go. And so it took me like
nearby a market. People from the
villages are always so nice. I don&#39;t
know. And guys, this is like a super
super small village. And to be honest,
like it feels so good to finally not be
in the chaos cuz so far I&#39;ve always been
like either like on the road, gas
stations, or like in big cities. Yeah,
it feels really good to just be able to
listen to the wind, to the nature, see
the sun, the mountains. Like, it&#39;s so
good. I needed this so much. Contrary to
what most people might assume, the
biggest struggle during this trip is not
the hitchhiking itself. The rides are
generally quite easy to get, and I also
don&#39;t mind waiting a few hours cuz
that&#39;s part of the adventure. Biggest
struggle is by far managing my social
energy. I&#39;m an introvert, like
extremely. I need my alone time to be
well. And when you&#39;re hitchhiking and
couch surfing all the time, it can be
difficult to be alone. Many times during
this trip, all I wanted was to be alone
at the end of the day while not spending
money on accumulation, but at the same
time, I have a place to charge my
computer and edit. And that was the
tricky part cuz I could easily just game
four nights in a row, but my computer
will die on the first one. So, this will
be a recurrent struggle during this
series from now on. And finding a
solution for it will be one of my
biggest challenges. Not having to lie,
is not exactly what I was expecting. Uh,
I thought there would be like more uh
sand, let&#39;s say. I don&#39;t know how much
the tide comes up.
But yeah, I mean there I think it&#39;s
still it&#39;s still okay.
It was starting to get quite windy and
the idea of sleeping in a mosque
couldn&#39;t leave my mind. So I decided to
go and see whether or not I could sleep
there. If I couldn&#39;t, then I would just
come back to the beach. Found myself my
source of water. Good. When I need to
sleep outside, there&#39;s always like these
things where to sleep, where to have
water, where to buy food. That&#39;s all I
need. Once it&#39;s covered, it&#39;s like I win
the game. Like I really like to approach
life as if it&#39;s a game cuz it just makes
it more fun, you know? I have a lot of
fun here. Both the outside and inside
doors of the mosque were open, but there
was no one there. I had heard from some
friends that it is generally okay to
sleep inside mosques, but I also didn&#39;t
want to be disrespectful to the religion
in any way. So, I searched a little bit
online to gather more information and
waited until it was dark to see if
someone would come. Well, I thought that
by this time today, I would be 350
kilometers south and probably sleeping
at the beach. But now I&#39;m here in a
random village I didn&#39;t even know
existed. I&#39;m going to sleep at a mosque.
And yeah, life gets random sometimes,
but I like it.
No one passed by and it was getting
quite cold, so I eventually went inside.
There was a lot of echo and it was all
dark which felt a bit creepy in the
beginning but then I realized I could
turn the lights on and everything felt
super cozy. I edited for a few hours
before falling asleep and was really
grateful to be inside because there was
a little storm during the night.
Good night.
So yeah, guys, it has definitely been
raining during the night. Like you can
see the tables like they&#39;re kind of wet.
I&#39;m kind of happy I was not at the
beach. I think my tent would have flied
completely. And now I&#39;m starting to
think like whether or not I should stay
at the beach tonight. So I think I&#39;m
just going to try to hitchhike as
further as possible south. I asked the
driver to drop me off at some place
where I can walk to a little village and
stay at another mosque. Yes. Yeah, the
night was pretty good. Actually,
since it was still quite early and I had
butter types nearby, I decided to cook
in the morning to save time during the
rest of the day. And guys, it&#39;s super
cold. Like, my hands are turning a bit
Okay, we are officially leaving the
mosque. To be honest, I was just
chilling for a long time, like eating
super slow, then taking pictures for the
thumbnail of the video. Um, so yeah,
it&#39;s almost 11:00.
I don&#39;t know how far I&#39;m going to make
it today, but yeah, it&#39;s what I told
you. I have time. I think I have like
800 900 km to do in 3 days. So, it&#39;s
quite chill. I still walked quite a lot
to get to the main road in Sarah
hitchhiking. And since it&#39;s a small
village, there wasn&#39;t a lot of movement.
But after about 20 minutes, I got a ride
that left me close to the highway.
I&#39;m going in the direction of the gas
station. Yeah, I hope that from the gas
station, it&#39;s going to be easy to get a
I was told by two different people that
I couldn&#39;t get to the gas station by
foot, but one of them offered to drive
me there. are thirsty or hungry
something else.
No, no, it&#39;s okay. Thank you.
Everything is okay.
Yeah, thank you so much. It was so kind.
And yeah, now I&#39;m finally
at the gas station. There&#39;s like a lot
of trucks there and like just the normal
cars here as well. I&#39;ll try my luck
first with the trucks and for that I
will write away Ismir, but then like if
it doesn&#39;t work with the trucks, I will
write the city that is between where I
am and Ismir and try to go there. I went
to a lot of trucks but none of them were
going in my direction. So I headed to
the dining area and started approaching
other people. So guys, I got a ride and
like the guy was like is yeah I go we
can come but like they are already five
in the car so I&#39;m not sure how we are
going to fit.
They were a really cute family on a road
trip to Ismid.
Okay, he&#39;s going with mom.
the guitar.
So that family, they were super nice,
super cute, and then the kid like he
wanted to hug me and whatever. But yeah,
now I&#39;m like a bit before Isme. I asked
them to drop me in a gas station before
cuz I really don&#39;t want to go to a big
city right now.
Going to a big city will make everything
more difficult as it is quite hard to
find a ride out. So my goal was to find
a car that will go past Ismir to then
stay in a small village.
Are you perhaps going towards Ismir?
Okay, thank you.
We I will go to
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
You go to Ismir. After almost 1 hour, I
realized it would be extremely difficult
to find someone going past is. So, I
decided to go to the city and from there
I would see what I could do.
I mean, if I
not where I wanted to go, but uh I&#39;m
just going to end it.
So, I think this really wasn&#39;t a good
decision. I&#39;m right now in the middle of
a huge city. There&#39;s no good gas station
nearby. I&#39;m close to the entrance of a
highway, but doesn&#39;t look very promising
either. Also, guys, this part, it
doesn&#39;t feel very safe. Like, it feels
like a quite poor part of Ismir. Yeah, I
wouldn&#39;t like to sleep like whatever. I
tried to hitch for 3 or 4 minutes, but
my gut was telling me not to do it. I
just wanted to get out of this region as
fast as possible. So, I quickly went to
a supermarket and then started walking
to the metro. And that was when
something weird happened. This woman saw
my sign and started saying she could
help me with the metro. I followed her
and when we got to the station, she
started talking to the guards. They
asked for my passport and then for some
reason they let me take the metro for
free. So, what do you think guys? Does
this count as hitchhiking a metro?
So, somehow I got to the place where I
wanted to be. Um, and now to be honest,
like I&#39;m so like overwhelmed. I just
need to calm down a bit. Then I try to
go to the mosque. If it doesn&#39;t work, I
go to the cheapest hostel I can find cuz
today I&#39;m feeling really like
I just need like a a place to stay. I
don&#39;t know.
There was a shopping center just next to
the metro station and so I went there to
eat my oats while searching for the
cheapest hostel.
But like the host they are quite
expensive like €16 or even more.
I walked another half an hour to get to
the mosque but the way there was kind of
steep kind of dying.
It&#39;s 20 kilos plus the food.
It&#39;s okay, guys. But honestly, like
leaving the region I was at in Ismir was
I think really good decision cuz here it
feels much more safe. Like not as much
confusion, not as much poverty poverty
poverty. Yeah, not as much poverty.
So yeah, I mean just walking around the
streets I feel like super safe. And in
the other place, I was like,
it really wasn&#39;t a good place. I don&#39;t
Okay, guys. We got to the mosque.
Let&#39;s see. I really hope it&#39;s open.
Like, please, please, please.
Okay, so this gate is open. I think I
can cross. And now I think I&#39;m going to
write like on Google Translate something
like I was trying to hitch like to
Antalya or something. I was wondering if
I could sleep here. I had my hijab.
Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try.
Okay, so no one is answering and it&#39;s
closed. I think there&#39;s no one inside.
Now I had two options. Go to a host and
buy at least 16 or sleep at a park just
a few minutes from the mosque. Okay, I
think here is a good spot. Like over
there is the street because of these two
trees is quite hidden. It also protects
me a bit from the wind. I don&#39;t know
like if it&#39;s a good idea to put my tent
cuz also then I have to take it down and
it might take some time. But it&#39;s not so
So I think I might just put my mattress,
my sleeping bag, put all the clothes I
have and I think I&#39;ll be okay. And
tomorrow early morning I I leave. I then
put all my layers on and went to sleep.
If you need to sleep outside like
without a tent, without anything, always
put like your most valuable stuff inside
the sleeping bag like here I have like
everything like passport, my phone, my
wallet. It goes inside of bag to towards
my feet so that like if someone wants to
steal my stuff, I have them. Good night,
guys. See you tomorrow.
Today is being very difficult. I
shouldn&#39;t have come to Ismir. Of course,
you can&#39;t stay in a night in my house.
Oh god, so many bad decisions on the
last two days. I hope this is not
another one.
