Hello, Phil here from Wings of Pegasus
and welcome to another analysis video.
If you enjoyed this video, please give
it a thumbs up and subscribe. On the
agenda tonight, we are going to be
taking a look at Sting. And this is
going to be a performance from the 22nd
of May this year, 2025.
So, we will jump into it. As always, the
link to the original video is in the
description below if you guys want to
cross reference anything that I&#39;m doing
here or just watch this without me
interrupting it and analyzing things.
But I will just let it play and we&#39;ll
see what&#39;s going on.
There were refu
You think
we&#39;re sleeping?
I&#39;m just going to jump in here because
I mean this is great.
Sting has and always has had a really
accurate voice. When we&#39;re talking about
pitch accuracy and the way that he
sings, his style, it&#39;s almost like with
every singer that we look at, you can
start to get an appreciation of their
voice just through the lines that we&#39;re
looking at. Because Sting&#39;s voice, he
with this particular performance, you
can see an almost total lack of any
distinct vibatto. you know, we&#39;ve got
these little kind of jumps that are
seemingly, you know, random. And and the
reason for that is because Sting&#39;s voice
is all about the accuracy. It&#39;s not
about hitting a pitch and then having a
wide vat that, you know, encapsulates
lots of pitch. So, as long as you&#39;re in
the right kind of wheelhouse, then you
you&#39;ll get away with it here. And I&#39;m
going to let this play from the
beginning again.
And with singers that have great vocal
accuracy, C 4, you can see that we are
so on pitch. But importantly,
this performance is entirely live.
Another thing that I love about this,
I&#39;m going to get rid of the pitch
monitoring software. It&#39;s, if I move
this across, it is a genuine threepiece
here. So, in a world full of, you know,
backing tracks and, you know, timecoded
performances
and laptops playing back instruments
that aren&#39;t on stage, all that kind of
stuff, triggering sounds. Here, we&#39;ve
got a genuine three-piece performance
that is live, and there&#39;s nothing going
on that you can&#39;t hear. And and the
reason that I love this is because it is
genuinely old school. Like myself as a
musician, as a guitarist, when I first
started playing the guitar, I was
listening to Jimmyi Hendris and Jimmyi
Hendris live was a genuine three-piece.
And I just love something about that
sound and the way that playing the
guitar just was so clear and and it was
so about filling space as a guitarist as
Jimmyi Hendricks did playing rhythm and
lead at the same time and doing so much
with one instrument to fill in so much
space. So here with the bass, the guitar
and drums, it is so refreshing just to
hear, you know, this performance and
obviously just just performing it as it
is live. This is what a three-piece
sounds like. So it&#39;s great. But then
yeah, when we jump into the vocals
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; again, look at this pitch accuracy. And
because this is a totally live vocal,
not lip sync, not mind. And I know that
people are now coming to my channel to
find out about artists and bands before
they buy a ticket to go and watch them
live to know what their history is and
whether they are going to be paying for
a fully live performance or whether
there are going to be elements that are
lip-sync or mimed or whether the vocal
is going to be autotuned and people can
then prepare themselves for the sound
they&#39;re going to hear so that when they
turn up they&#39;re not then surprised to
see and hear that oh their voice came
out and they weren&#39;t moving. moving
their mouth or their vocal has been so
perfect throughout the whole performance
or more than likely you can hear the
vocal flip to the wrong note because
autotune is in use is being prepared for
that kind of thing and having that in
mind when thinking about buying tickets
because nowadays tickets cost a lot of
money so it is important to know exactly
what you&#39;re paying for but in this case
if you go and watch Sting live you&#39;re
going to absolutely get a live
performance and I think a lot of the
time Sting Sting does have a larger band
and that is all fully live as well. I&#39;ve
never really seen anything with Sting
going on that is um suspect in any way
with things not quite being as they
seem. I know that I have done a video on
Sting and Robert Downey Jr. where we
looked at crowdshot footage and then the
official release on YouTube was then
pitch corrected. So that is something
that happened but it didn&#39;t mean that
they weren&#39;t doing it live. The crowd
shot footage showed you that the pitch
was obviously a lot more off than the
pitch corrected vocals because pitch
correction is calibrating it to A440
where as you can see here we&#39;ve got
points where we&#39;re ever so slightly
below and a little bit below here. But
this is a totally live vocal and this is
really accurate. So for people that are
learning to sing and you&#39;re not on these
lines all the time, you you don&#39;t want
to be on the lines all the time. The
best voices of all time have never been
on these lines all the time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great example here, live vocal between
the G# 3 and the A3.
And this is something that I love about
Sting&#39;s vocal approach is that he
doesn&#39;t take any prisoners because his
vocal is so
straight. It&#39;s so upfront. It&#39;s so
unique. You just know his voice straight
away. And the reason that you know it
straight away is because of his
delivery. the way that listen to this
that that onset the vocal cord onset of
that note is instant. And we can see
here where we&#39;ve changed from the A3 to
the C sharp 4 how that happened in a
split second. So I&#39;m going to take that
back and just explain what I mean.
Every single d
day. He&#39;s not going every single day.
He&#39;s not blending his way into it with
air day
where you can It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re
giving yourself a safety net because you
can introduce your note softly. If
you&#39;re a little bit flat, you can go up
a bit. If you&#39;re sharp, you can come
down a bit.
So then what you&#39;re left with is a note
that&#39;s going to be a lot more accurate.
Here we&#39;ve got the opposite where it&#39;s
it&#39;s instant. There&#39;s no blending into
this. So, wherever this pitch is going
to fall, it&#39;s going to fall. You can&#39;t
edit it as you&#39;re going. And this is,
you know, this is where we are between
notes. But the reason that this is here
and it hasn&#39;t been more accurate is just
because of the style, the way that Sting
sings and and the reason that it&#39;s great
is because he will hit notes right
between the eyes with this fast onset
where he just nails it. And we are I
haven&#39;t watched this whole performance
because yeah, it&#39;s very long. I don&#39;t
know how long it is, but
I guarantee you that he will hit a note
right between the eyes with this fast
onset without blending in. Let&#39;s listen
Yeah, good example here. F sharp 4. And
listen to I mean, look at this. When I
said he&#39;s really accurate, have a look
at this. A3, bang on. C4, bang on. And
then we&#39;ve got the resets that always
happen. Oh, they always happen with
natural voices because we&#39;re not
calibrated. But great singers with great
pitch have the ability to hit these
lines, you know, once, twice, three
times in a row. As soon as you start
getting more than that, you know, five,
six, seven, eight times, that&#39;s
calibration. That&#39;s something that human
vocal cords can&#39;t and don&#39;t do. They
they can&#39;t calibrate themselves to a
graph like this, to a set of pitches, to
zero sense. But anyway, yeah, listen to
You see?
No. Can&#39;t you see
the way that he see?
Interestingly, you see this little
wobble down.
And when he&#39;s now connecting his vocal
cords more, this is exactly the opposite
of what I just said. That because he&#39;s
now part of a longer phrase that&#39;s all
connected, he&#39;s just guiding his voice
up to this place.
you belong.
And he&#39;s just straight in there
absolutely over the E4. But again,
technically, this is still you belong.
Still connected in that phrase, but
that&#39;s still that fast onset.
That note is just going to be where it
is. So, it is very much like Sting&#39;s
voice is is a leap of faith. He&#39;s always
just just leaping to the note and if he
hits it then he hits it but if he
doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t care. He because if
Sting cared then he would be having this
soft onset all the time because he
doesn&#39;t want to miss a note. But this is
what artistry is all about that you sing
how you sing and you don&#39;t care about
where it goes or what it does because
it&#39;s your voice. And I think, yeah, it&#39;s
a great lesson to learn from great
singers that they&#39;re not really thinking
about all of this when they&#39;re singing.
They&#39;re just doing it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; By the way, B4,
like top end of the male tenor range,
A4. And I&#39;m just going to go back here.
Another thing about Sting&#39;s voice is we
already heard him go up with a little
bit more of an airy sound, but he can
connect his vocal cords up this high
before that didn&#39;t sound like it it was
light or in a head voice place. It just
sounded really consistent with the rest
of his voice. And that&#39;s, you know,
that&#39;s the secret or should I say that&#39;s
what everyone&#39;s aiming for to that tonal
consistency throughout your range.
quick onset here. Perfectly on that C
sharp four.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, it&#39;s great. Look at all of these
resets that we&#39;re getting because it&#39;s
just a totally live vocal. I think this
is something that people appreciate when
they&#39;re going to watch a fully live show
or at least they think they&#39;re going to
see a fully live show. This is the kind
of vocal that is only going to happen on
this night at this time and it&#39;s been
captured on video for us to to watch and
enjoy again. But
it&#39;s great to know that when or at least
I think it&#39;s great to know when you&#39;re
watching an an artist perform live that
they are going to give you a unique
performance for that night that you&#39;ve
turned up. It&#39;s not going to be just a
copy and paste literally from another
to your
baby. I hear baby.
Yeah. No, we have I mean that&#39;s um that
I mean between the G sharp and the A4.
should have been an A4 there, but we
went to Sting went to a bit of a more of
a bit more of a head voice sound there.
But I want to take that back because
again, this chorus is crazy. I just said
a few minutes ago, top end of the male
tenner range is an A4. So here G4 and
listening we&#39;ll go back
and I mean this is great because I&#39;ve
spoken about this on the channel with um
great artists, great singers and um
vocal coaches as well about changing the
phrasing of a vocal. And I I really like
just that changing the phrasing, the
cadence from what it is originally
because it&#39;s something that artistically
is really cool. It&#39;s a different line.
And it&#39;s something that you&#39;re going to
hear live that you don&#39;t hear on the
original record, but it serves another
purpose of conserving energy and
conserving your voice because this this
chorus is crazy when we&#39;re talking about
these notes.
You know, it&#39;s all the way up there
and he kind of gets out of that phrase
quite quickly.
And now
So, we&#39;re still up there. G4,
see your face. And he&#39;s still in this
kind of He&#39;s not holding back. It&#39;s not
like he&#39;s, you know, going
and making it easier for himself
because, you know, he&#39;s just going to
give you his sound. And I I don&#39;t think
that he would ever change the way that
he sings this. He&#39;s he&#39;s just going to
phrase it slightly differently in order
to, you know, conserve as much of his
voice as he can.
No, vibra. We saw it. Pitch monitoring
software there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And even here
the way that he just ascended
and he&#39;s kind of finding his way here to
the A4,
but again, this is a natural voice. So
being kind of flat of the A4, he&#39;s
already just done loads of A4s. And when
you&#39;re spending so much time in this
area, like I said, a lot of it is about
kind of conserving, reserving your voice
so that you can keep on hitting these
Embrace, you know, that again, just
turning off
Yeah, this is great. And I think
everyone who&#39;s learning to sing, they
need to watch and just all artists in in
bands and singers, they need to watch
these kinds of performances because
you&#39;re talking about one of the greatest
artists of all time and he&#39;s hitting
between the lines here. is, you know,
he&#39;s really delving into these
microones. So, when you are singing
yourself and you might sing live and you
might hit a note like this and you
think, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m no good. I I&#39;m not as
accurate as, you know, my favorite
singer who happens to, by the way, be
pitch corrected or autotuned.&#34; And
people that might lose heart, you think,
well, no, great singers do this. And
this is what performing live is. When
you&#39;re watching an artist who has that
artistic integrity of doing everything
genuinely live for their audience,
you&#39;re going to see this and you&#39;re
going to hear this regularly.
There you go.
straight in there with the E4
and the A3. And it is that kind of W.
It is kind of making vowel sounds with
that that that fast onset,
you know, just O&#39;s. Yeah. Yeah. That
again, that&#39;s part of his sound. That&#39;s
what he does. Not just on O&#39;s, but it&#39;s
all kind of rolling this all into why
his voice is so unique
and the VA at the end there. And Oh, you
could say that that A3, yeah, was was
below the line. Actually, probably
closer to the G# 3, which we can&#39;t see
at the bottom of the screen, but it
didn&#39;t matter. You listening to it
there&#39;s no way that that
it didn&#39;t register as
there, even though it was closer to the
note below. It&#39;s amazing when you&#39;re
listening to things in context how
musically they make sense, but when you
look at it on a graph, you think, &#34;Oh,
well, that that wasn&#39;t where it should
have been, but live it&#39;s it worked.&#34; So,
why is that happening? It&#39;s because we
don&#39;t listen by looking at a graph. And
this is why calibrating vocals is so
crazy. And calibrating vocals as an
industry standard to this graph which is
now happening. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so stupid
because you&#39;re missing out on this kind
of thing. But if you are thinking of
going and watching Stling live, you&#39;re
going to get a fully live performance,
fully live vocal as well. And it&#39;s going
to be a unique vocal and performance for
that night that you have spent your
money on tickets to go and see. Anyway,
thank you guys for requesting this
particular video for me to take a look
at for tonight. And keep those requests
coming to requests wingsofpegasus.com.
As always, let me know what you guys
think in the comments section below, and
I&#39;ll catch you guys at the next one.
