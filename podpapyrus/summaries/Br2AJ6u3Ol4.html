the Joe Rogan experience.
You have this cartel now that is, you
know, you have Elmo Sambad is gone. El
Chapo&#39;s sons are cutting a deal. One of
them apparently has made an alliance
with the the head of the the the new
generation cartel, a man by Elno. Uh is
the nickname is Elmeno. Neio Sea Cvantes
is real name. Uh last time I was here,
there was like uh this almost 5 years
ago I was here. There were questions
about if he was even alive or not. You
know, people thought that he was like
being kept alive as a folk figure. Uh
because he&#39;s low-key
uh very low-key, not like he&#39;s not
flashy, everything&#39;s militarized. He&#39;s
very good at his uh trade craft. Um but
recently, you know, he&#39;s very much
alive. Um he&#39;s very much uh exposed
himself a few times. He was almost
arrested recently and the federal police
apparently tipped off his security about
the operation against him. It&#39;s the
second time he was almost arrested. Uh
he&#39;s the biggest target right now in
Mexico. Um
we recently learned through the media of
uh the the Trump&#39;s uh authorization of
utilizing military action in in me in
Latin America in general, you know, all
the way from Venezuela all the way up to
Mexico. And you know, you hear these
rumblings of like, how is this military
operation going to look like? Is this
going to be an invasion? You know, is
are we going to see like a column of US
Marines driving down to Tijuana? Um,
we&#39;re probably getting spend some time
in Tijuana for It&#39;s probably not a good
good idea. Uh, are we going to see like
people uh Delta Force guys showing up in
Tijuana in in Koulagon and and going on
a raid on on their own without
permission of the local authorities?
What&#39;s this going to look like? Um
I I don&#39;t see a direct trust between
Mexico and the Mexico and the United
States anymore. There&#39;s like there&#39;s
issues there. Um the US has realized
that politics are are compromised at
high level in Mexico
completely.
Uh with the example of the recent almost
arrest of Nessio Sega Gasvantes, you see
that the federal forces are compromised
as well. So, like, who do you trust as
an American force that is trying to um
cut the stem of drugs into this country
is as is kind of the excuse that they&#39;re
utilizing for this designation? And and
who who do you trust down there? Um
I I posted um I I&#39;m I&#39;m friends with a
bunch of dorks and they&#39;re all looking
at Flight Tracker and intelligence and
stuff like that. I&#39;m a dork, too. Um,
and one of them sent me this this uh
suspicious
drone, American drone flying over the
state of Mexico in circles. And I posted
it immediately. You know, I think I was
one of the first ones to post it online
and a press briefing happened almost
immediately and the head of public
safety in Mexico, Omar Gazaru, said
like, &#34;Oh yeah, this is we asked for
this drone to fly over this area.&#34;
Who did you ask? Uh, this is not a
military drone, but we asked for it to
fly over this area,
which I I don&#39;t think he knows what&#39;s
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] going on. I
don&#39;t know why. I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t
think he knows why there&#39;s a drone
flying over a very specific part of
Mexico. I don&#39;t know. It seemed like he
didn&#39;t or either he didn&#39;t want to
reveal the this this drone or but um
there there have been many times
recently of drones just flying close to
the close to the border or over over
Mexico. They&#39;re clearly drawing a map,
an intelligence map of targets in
Mexico. So, something is coming, I
Um, but what is it going to look like
though is the question that people are
asking. I I don&#39;t know. Um, speaking to
somebody like Gafe down in Mexico, he
was a former member of the special
operations. Uh, and I asked him like,
&#34;Hey, what is the military going to do
if the US says like we&#39;re going in
without your approval?
He said, &#34;Well, you if you start
fighting the cartels without approval of
the Mexican government, you will turn
criminal organizations into freedom
and they&#39;re already integrated into the
military in certain ways because some of
them are working for them and some of
them are working for us. So, you will
make the whole a cohesive force against
Oh, boy. Um, which is an interesting
theory, you know, if that happens. Um,
that seems likely.
It it does. I mean,
yeah, because there&#39;s like anti-US
sentiment already. And then also the the
closing of the borders and
it&#39;s a perfect storm. I mean,
Trump is
divisive and in Mexico, he has been
turned into this very
u clear uh like enemy like this is the
enemy, you know. uh specifically by
politicians down there. He&#39;s pretty easy
to just vilify like it&#39;s it&#39;s fault. You
know, why is Cena law on fire? Maybe
it&#39;s because you have a corrupt governor
there who was clearly in cartel ties and
stuff like that who&#39;s part of your
party, but you haven&#39;t figured out how
to get him out of office. Maybe it&#39;s
that or no, it&#39;s the US because they
abducted El Mayo. That&#39;s why that place
is on fire.
Charge someone with treason.
That&#39;s why they charge somebody with
high treason, which is unheard of, but
there you go. Um, so like who
who are you going to trust in that
realm? And so Mexico has pressed the
whole the US is is responsible for this
and they&#39;re kind of wiping their hands
from it. And the US is keeps pointing
their finger at the high level
government, which is something again
five years ago I I spoke about this on
this podcast and I got a lot of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] for
for it. I said there&#39;s no way of going
after cartels in Mexico without going
after the government.
because they&#39;re one and the same in a
lot of places. And that was back then
and now it&#39;s even more clear as how tied
they are. Um if nothing happens, if the
United States doesn&#39;t do anything, how
much bigger can the cartels get? This is
the question. It&#39;s like,
what is going to happen to just
this entire country? Th this
if you have a if you have and this is
what that&#39;s that&#39;s why you have a lot of
conflicts happening in routes that are
leading towards a border.
Um the Senon cartel operated in a very
old-fashioned way. You know they
wouldn&#39;t noas it was their politics.
Don&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] where you eat was their
politics for a long time. Um you you saw
a change in this when um
I the brutality aspect and how just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
changed in Mexico. Um, there was an
incident. members of Los Arianiano Felix
cartel, the Tijuana cartel, were in a
direct conflict with elements of O Chapo
Guzman&#39;s organization
and they had a assassin
they had an assassin basically
infiltrate the living circle of one of
El Chapo&#39;s main guys, Alo Palma,
and he seduced his wife,
killed her, and abducted his kids and
threw them off a bridge and sent that
video to Alto Palma.
And I think after I mean brutal [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] had
happened after that before that but I
think that set off this
at some point that
whole war that happened, you know, um
you start getting the element of the
Zetas coming in who were former special
operator guys who basically said like we
can start our own cartel which a lot of
them were Fort Bragg trained individuals
that went down to Yeah. Some of them,
some of them went through the Green
Beret course. Uh, foreign nationals go
through that course a lot. So, they went
to the Green Beret course and then they
go back to Mexico and then as soon as
they get back to Mexico like, &#34;Oh,
congratulations on your cool green beret
and all this training. Come train our
guys or come work for us.&#34; Um, so at
some point all of this started
militarizing the conflict in Mexico. It
went from gang against gang violence,
which is like very reminiscent of some
of the stuff that happened up here
during the gang uh era uh or some of the
alapone era, you know, uh shootouts
between people. Um
the Zetas changed the game. They started
bringing in guerilla warfare tactics
into into this realm. Um they started
doing all those torture videos and
cartel execution videos. That&#39;s that
that comes from them. They realize that,
you know, part of a guerrilla warfare
campaign is propaganda. And how can you
make propaganda of shooting a guy in a
right? Film it.
So, they changed that game. um they
started realizing that yeah, it&#39;s one
thing having a kid with like sneakers on
the back of a truck with an AK whose dad
was part of the organization and he
brought his kid in, but it&#39;s probably a
better idea to have militarized or
paramilitary groups working with us, you
know. So, they started getting these
evolutions of ideas of what a criminal
organization should be. Um
and all of that, you know, um the
members of the new generation cartel
that is now kind of like dominating
Mexico started off as a zeta hunting
force by the that the xenol cartel
formed in Halisco and they said like
well we can do this for ourselves now
too as well. So that&#39;s how they
originated in a lot of ways.
So this organization has taken the
textbook learning process of all these
other cartels and is now this cartel
with all this foundation, educational
foundation as far as how to set up an
organization, how to set up all these
transnational routes, how to operate on
both sides of the border, how to augment
their capabilities constantly through
technology. Um,
drone warfare was first seen I think in
Mexico. You start, you saw drones
dropping bombs and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like that in
Mexico before the Ukrainian conflict,
but they got really good at it. I mean,
the Ukrainians have [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] taken that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] to an art form. There are Mexican
nationals fighting for their foreign
services, their foreign uh brigades in
in the Ukraine, and some of them have
gone into that route, drone operators,
and some of them are coming back.
And you started seeing this sudden
sophistication. And it used to be
bomblelets dropped from these commercial
drones and the explosives in them were
probably mining level explosives. You
start seeing these u these uh bomits
made and they&#39;re more reminiscent of
Colombian explosives uh or IRA era
explosives and now you&#39;re seeing these
uh coordinated drone attacks on military
forces in Mexico. I think they recently
got a some high level army official.
They got him with a drone. Didn&#39;t kill
him, but almost they almost killed him.
Um, so we started seeing these drone now
being oper drones now being operated uh
as scouts. So you can&#39;t get close to
them because these drones are in the
sky. Um, so now you&#39;re seeing drone uh
cartels fighting against other cartel
drones. So now we&#39;re seeing cartel guys
with these futuristic drone anti- drone
guns in the field.
I&#39;ve seen those things. Yeah. They look
like space guns, but they but in the
hands of a cartel guy wearing like
sandals, which is what&#39;s go what the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] going on with these people. Uh,
so you start seeing all this
augmentation of capabilities.
This single cartel now has all of this
history behind it, all of these lessons
behind it, all this training behind it,
all this technology,
and it is poised to make punch a hole
right through its territory and go up
north into the United States. Right.
There are no segments of the border wall
currently that is that are actually
controlled and or or a city that is
controlled by the new generation cartel
that is on the border. That&#39;s not the
case now.
But there are places that are starting
to maybe look like they&#39;re going that
way. Um, Tijuana being one of them. Uh,
where I&#39;m from, you start seeing
uh the last remaining sons of Oapuzan
that are free. Uh, Archivaldo is the
strongest one. Um, and his faction of
those Chapito as what they call
themselves
this past year announced that they had
reached an alliance with this new
cartel, this the new generation cartel.
So it&#39;s now it&#39;s a cohesive force and
they had historical ties and and and and
and and a part of the border that they
owned already that they inherited from
their dad. So that nightmare scenario of
having this cartel now having a clear
doorway into United States is it&#39;s
pretty close if it&#39;s not there already.
And how wild would it be if the border
was still wide open
because they&#39;ve cut down on illegal
immigrants by some high 90%.
Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s way down. There&#39;s still
crossings going on, but Oh, yeah. It&#39;s
just It&#39;s really expensive. It&#39;s really
expensive.
You got to get that guy off TikTok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
There&#39;s a bunch of ways they do. Uh I
saw one where they were like, &#34;Hey,
they&#39;ll grab a a portfolio full of uh
copies of IDs and like, &#34;Oh, you look
like this dude.&#34; And then they&#39;ll give
you uh you know they like just get
really drunk before you cross and
they&#39;ll pretend you&#39;re asleep and
they&#39;ll give you paperwork that looks
like the dude that looks like you and
that&#39;s how they cross people and it&#39;s a
lot. It&#39;s very expensive. That&#39;s how
they cross you.
Fast boats, you know, there&#39;s a bunch of
videos online just boats just arriving
on the beach and just dudes jumping out.
It&#39;s a classic running and running.
There&#39;s like
once they&#39;re in, they&#39;re in.
There&#39;s a shortage of those wave
runners. There&#39;s a shortage of them in
Mexico because they just buy them just a
Well, a short trip. I mean, if you think
if you you get on one in Tijana and you
hop over to San Diego, it&#39;s not that
No. And and and they&#39;ll swarm it now.
They&#39;ll do many of those boats and and
if you were in TJ, you could see off the
coast. There&#39;s a bunch of Navy ships now
off the coast there. So, like which is a
cause for alarm for a lot of Mexicans.
the Mex when I say Mexicans view any
sort of intervention by the United
States with fear
although they are also fearful of what
happens if this is allowed to continue
in Mexico and they don&#39;t see any
solutions from the government so
it seems like the opposite seems like
it&#39;s going more and more towards the
cartel Yeah.
