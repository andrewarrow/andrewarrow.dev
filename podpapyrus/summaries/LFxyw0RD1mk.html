<li>The Gateway Experience is a set of meditation CDs from the 70s/80s that uses hemisync technology to access different states of consciousness</li>
<li>CIA documents reveal a technique called "patterning" - using consciousness in Focus 12 state to achieve desired objectives by visualizing as if already accomplished</li>
<li>In expanded awareness states, thought patterns create holograms that establish the basis for manifesting desired realities</li>
<li>Warning: Forcing the manifestation process too quickly can cause reality dislocation with drastic, undesired consequences</li>
<li>Reality Transurfing teaches that putting things on pedestals creates "increased importance" which generates resistance and blocks manifestation</li>
<li>Pendulums are thought structures that gain energy from collective focus - examples include political parties, sports teams, news media</li>
<li>Fighting pendulums feeds them energy; the way to defeat them is to ignore and withdraw your energy from them</li>
<li>99.9% of news content is negative to keep people in fear and contracted states, making them easier to control</li>
<li>Popular music is allegedly tuned to frequencies that keep people in dissonance rather than the heart frequency of 432 Hz</li>
<li>Group intention amplifies manifestation power - when multiple people focus on one outcome, the collective energy grows exponentially</li>
<li>Archetypes within collective consciousness can be accessed and embodied by tuning into specific qualities like courage or empowerment</li>
<li>Meditation is one of the most powerful ways to transform consciousness and access new versions of yourself</li>
<li>Beliefs create reality, but identity and worldview are even more fundamental in determining your experience</li>
<li>Reality operates like holograms - you shift to different reality potentials based on the energy frequency you embody</li>
<li>Resonant frequency tuning through sound (like group "om" activations) elevates vibration and creates heart-mind coherence</li>
<li>The key is feeling into the frequency of your desired reality as if it's happening now, rather than wanting or needing it</li>

what if there was hidden esoteric
information about how reality works that
was so powerful it was literally kept
from the average person&#39;s awareness
what if the CIA
actually had documents that were
forbidden or hidden documents that talk
about the exact topics I&#39;m going to be
sharing with you in this video
and what if if you understood these
Concepts it would completely transform
your world view about what reality is
and it would Empower you in a completely
new way
now what I&#39;m going to share with you is
something that I learned six years ago
and it comes from uh these right here
these called the gateway experience it&#39;s
a set of uh DVDs from the 70s and the
80s or not even DVDs but CDs that are
meditations
that actually these costs when I bought
this back in 2017 it cost five hundred
dollars and the reason I bought this is
because someone that I know that I&#39;ve
known my whole entire life shared with
me and said if you get these exact CDs
and you listen to these meditations it
will completely transform your
consciousness
it will expand your awareness this
person is someone that I knew my entire
and also once they saw me making YouTube
videos in 2017 and my YouTube channel
started to grow they saw that I was into
these kind of things and he very
blatantly told me get these CDs it will
transform your life and begin listening
to the meditations
so I went online I found that there I
thought it was going to be like 60 bucks
500 used were these DVD CDs right here
and basically what they are it&#39;s a
specific technology called hemisync that
you use that of headphones with that
puts your brainwave frequency into a
certain pattern that then allows you to
access different states of consciousness
with what I&#39;m going to share with you in
this video
it has to do with a very specific
technique that is called patterning
now patterning and in the CIA document
that I want to share with you it says
this technique involves the use of
Consciousness to achieve desired
objectives in the physical emotional or
intellectual sphere it involves
concentrations on the desired objective
while in a Focus 12 state
so a Focus 12 State there&#39;s a certain
DVD in here or a CD you keep saying DVD
and once you ex once you experience
Focus 12 it&#39;s a certain frequency a
certain brainwave state that you get
into where in a way your subconscious is
more influenced but also you have the
ability to just feel into different
states of emotion much easier
now basically what this document shows
the CIA document that was like you know
hidden for a long time there&#39;s a
specific and even the meditation in here
called patterning that&#39;s specifically
the one that I&#39;ve been listening to
that I was listening to especially in
um that was helping me get into a
certain state of consciousness
and then what I would do is I would
imagine myself as the version of me
that was already
in the reality that I preferred so I&#39;d
imagine how that version of me would
think feel act as if it already existed
and what I would do is I would stay in
that state in this meditation
this particular methodology is based on
the belief that the thought patterns
generated by our Consciousness in a
state of expanded awareness create
Holograms which represent the situation
we desire to bring about and in doing so
establish the basis for actual
realization of that goal
so let me kind of summarize that in
certain states of consciousness
in certain brainwave activities
that we can get into using the power of
meditation
when we feel in that state and we
visualize it what we end up doing is
creating a certain holographic energy
like literally our reality
is based on energy everything in our
reality is based on energy and
everything is vibrating at a certain
what the CIA document is mentioning what
these tapes kind of also are talking
is that when you get to a certain State
of Consciousness and you feel a specific
you then
are amplifying an energy that it
attracts to you more Holograms that are
in resonance with that energy you are
this also I believe if you look at the
work of Dr Joe dispenza
which it&#39;s all about meditation and
connecting to the quantum field and
feeling and creating a new sense of self
a new sense of connection to a New
Vision as if it&#39;s happening now
so many people experience miraculous
healings Transformations from this
it literally could be based in what this
is actually say the CIA document is
saying now here is something to be
mindful of this is a warning okay this
is not BS it actually says this
Monroe trainers so Robert Monroe was the
person that was studying out-of-body
experiences astral projection remote
viewing there was a government
organization that eventually in a way
they would test and they would get
people that would test these different
on and and to see what is reality and
what this document is is pretty much the
findings from doing these different type
of exercises
now Robert Monroe in the Monroe
Institute and the trainers caution
against attempting to force the pace of
this process because the individual
could succeed in dislocating his
existing reality with drastic
consequences
think about that basically what it&#39;s
saying is that if you get into this
state of consciousness and you feel as
if it&#39;s happening now but you try to
rush it what you could end up doing is
forcing a situation to happen
that is actually undesired but goes
against the forcing of what you were
trying to do for example I remember
reading this in the book and watching uh
when I became obsessed with this back in
2017 I was watching YouTube videos
there&#39;s a guy named Thomas Campbell who
was one of the like he&#39;s like a
scientist that talks about a lot about
what&#39;s called the the big toe the big
Theory of Everything which has to do
with our reality being a stimulation
kind of like a virtual reality that we
live in and this is the Avatar he was
someone that tested and that worked a
lot with the um kind of like the Monroe
technology back in the 70s in the 80s
but basically one thing that it
cautioned against is like for example I
want a hundred thousand dollars I want a
hundred thousand dollars I want a
hundred thousand dollars focusing on the
hundred thousand dollars you already
have the hundred thousand dollars but if
you try to force it
what it said could happen is maybe
something undesirable happens like
someone passes away and you inherit that
money you inherit money
so trying to force a specific situation
in the Hologram of reality May begin
bringing it to you but maybe in ways
that are unpleasant
maybe in ways that you don&#39;t actually
so with what I&#39;m sharing with you in
this video it&#39;s important to understand
there&#39;s a pace
there&#39;s a process to all of this
and what you want to do and what I
recommend and what I&#39;ve been doing and
the way I&#39;ve really manifested the
abundance in my life
is by visualizing myself being in the
frequency of what I want to experience
as if it&#39;s happening now
and feeling into that every single day
Neville Goddard separate from this whole
CIA document Gateway experience thing he
talked a lot about as you&#39;re going to
bed at night feel as if you are that
version of you now as you do so you are
influencing your own subconscious mind
and as you do that you literally begin
to reorganize your frequency reorganize
your energy
and you begin to believe more in this
new potential you begin to believe more
in this new version of you
now with what I&#39;m sharing
with all of this something else I
that is also Beyond just the identity
part of this something else I wanted to
share when it comes to Hidden esoteric
is something that comes from a book
called reality Tran surfing I have not
talked about this book in a very very
long time with good reason
because when I was it was just anyways I
haven&#39;t been talking about reality Tran
surfing very very long time even though
it&#39;s a very powerful book it&#39;s written
by a Quantum physicist named Vadim
Zealand in Russia it&#39;s been transcribed
to English back in 2017-18 I made a ton
of videos about this and then I stopped
um I think basically what happened is I
I started getting I started like I was
sending thousands and thousands of
people to buy this book called reality
Tran surfing but what happened is there
were people from certain organizations
that taught reality Tran surfing that
didn&#39;t like that I was getting so many
views about that
and basically those video it became this
whole BS I had to deal with where even
though I&#39;m selling even though I&#39;m
pretty much selling the book for them
and sending people to this idea
and to these to this uh these Concepts
it was like they I don&#39;t think they
liked the fact that I looked like a
reality Tran surfing expert when I
wasn&#39;t I was just sharing a book you
know but there&#39;s all these there&#39;s all
you know the legality
I don&#39;t think I wasn&#39;t even doing
anything illegal I was just sharing a
book and selling and pretty much sending
people to it anyways I didn&#39;t talk about
it for three years because it was a lot
of BS I think that BS is over so I&#39;m
going to share a concept from it there&#39;s
a concept from reality Tran surfing
which is all about understanding in a
way that What&#39;s called the space of
variations there are these there is this
Quantum possibilities that exist so what
reality Tran surfing talks a lot about
is it talks about gliding through what
is called the space of variation and one
of the main things that I&#39;ve gained
benefit from this is understanding a
concept that has to do with increased
and decreased importance anything we
make very important we put on a pedestal
and the universe then gives a reality
that is equal to that resistance so if
you put a job that you want on a
pedestal you are energetically severed
from it because it&#39;d be really really
cool if it would happen it&#39;s resistance
balance forces from the universe come
into place to make sure that that stays
balanced out which means you don&#39;t get
that which you want if you really really
want it
if you put someone else on a pedestal it
it then creates resistance around that
it creates increased importance on them
and then the energy is all messed up and
that person well I honestly kind of also
feel that desperate needy energy and
it&#39;s unattractive but in reality Tran
surfing terms this is all about
understanding that balance of energy so
one of the things I learned is you want
it to be natural for you to experience
what you want it&#39;s natural for you to be
abundant it is natural for you to be in
a loving relationship it is natural for
you to have that that role that you want
or the business that you want
when you let it be natural
it completely changes the energy dynamic
so that was one concept the other
concept I want to share is something
called pendulums
reality Tran surfing is a column step
called pendulums that has to do with
thought structures the idea is that even
though you can&#39;t see physically certain
thought structures the idea is that
because we&#39;re in a collective
Consciousness and we&#39;re all connected
what happens
is there&#39;s enter there&#39;s literally
thoughts that come around us that we
can&#39;t necessarily see and when we&#39;re
interacting with other people we&#39;re in a
way active activating different thought
forms I know this sounds esoteric but
just bear with me for a minute
now what pendulums the goal of a
pendulum is to gain more energy
pendulums are thought structures that
also exist within our reality and there
are very big thought structures because
there are billions of people thinking
similar thoughts
for example being Republican or Democrat
whichever one you are there are
pendulums around both
and when there are thought structures
around both there&#39;s like almost like a
rule rules of what it means to be a
Democrat or Republican
and these two pendulums fight each other
because they want to be right
there are pendulums around football
there are pendulums around Sports
there are pendulums around movies around
music there&#39;s a pendulum around my
YouTube channel
and the idea behind pendulums is
is it gains energy the more people that
focus on it
now what happens is when you start going
down and you start taking on certain
it can in a way dominate your thoughts
so some people start focusing on like
you see it happen a lot conspiracy
theory they go down a rabbit hole it
then takes up so much of their life and
their feel becomes very interesting like
kind of like
kind of like scattered or it&#39;s like
there&#39;s a lot of uh debris in it because
they&#39;re thinking of all these things
that honestly have a lot of resistance a
lot of times
but then they tuned more easily to more
of it the goal of pendulums is to gain
energy now the thing is is pendulums
will keep you from living in your
authentic truth
they will keep you from expressing your
true self
and pendulums are not always bad but in
general they have their own intention
they have their own goal
that&#39;s why it&#39;s very important to become
aware of what and when
pendulums may be taking
your your power from you pendulums
there&#39;s pendulums around the news
there&#39;s pendulums around Sports there&#39;s
pendulums around just about everything
so when people watch the news and they
think they&#39;re having their own thoughts
many times it&#39;s a pendulum that&#39;s
overtaken them then they get into fear
and that keeps them from being in their
true frequency keeps them treat from
creating their own reality
and harnessing their own energy
so pendulums of in a way are like
thought structures
that you may not visibly see
but may have a certain power if you put
all your energy in it and you&#39;re not
aware of it now what is the degree what
is the
process of defeating a pendulum you
you can&#39;t the more you fight a pendulum
the more it grows you see this happening
when people are running for president
one person basically Whoever has the
stronger pendulum as a president
normally wins
because even if you fight a pendulum
you&#39;re feeding it energy
it&#39;s like for example when you see Trump
running for president
he gets a lot of attention he has a lot
of people that are very fanatic about
him that very much like him and want him
to win and you have a lot of people that
really don&#39;t want him to win
that actually feeds his pendulum
uh the other people I think of it had
very strong pendulums
back in the day as if you talk about the
YouTube sphere Logan Paul David dobrik
they have very strong pendulums and I
remember especially back in the day it
would it would grow to such an extent
that they were at this very high like an
unattainable level of influence
but sometimes what happens with
pendulums is
once there&#39;s a certain especially if
there&#39;s a certain degree of like kind of
getting lost in it
it smacks it humbles it and that was
what happened with both Logan Paul and
David dobrik I found it very interesting
and the purpose of these pendulums and
that the power in it is observing them
and ignoring them if it&#39;s running your
life in a negative way
the news like ignored that ignore the
news you don&#39;t fight the news you just
don&#39;t watch it you don&#39;t tune to it
become aware of that energy so pendulums
in a way are thought structures and it&#39;s
this weird kind of hidden esoteric
concept but once I started becoming
aware of it I started to become more
aware of even the music I listen to
because you want to know something
interesting
there&#39;s certain frequencies most popular
music is tuned to that keeps people in a
certain frequency
I&#39;ve heard I don&#39;t know if this is true
but I&#39;ve heard that certain frequency of
432 Hertz which is like the frequency of
the heart frequency of love
I&#39;ve heard music in general is not
allowed to really be at that frequency I
don&#39;t know how true this is but
I do know that a lot of a lot of music
is tuned to just a little bit above or
below that that kind of like keeps
people in dissonance
I also think of this sometimes when I
talk about
I talked to Bashar about this as well I
will say that like Bashar a big fan of
been watching this content for like 10
15 years since I&#39;ve been on my Awakening
I actually talked about reality Tran
surfing and pendulums when I was asking
him questions once and basically he said
that within our Collective Consciousness
there are certain archetypes
and these archetypes we can begin to
take on
by tuning to it and embodying it
there are archetypes for the king the
lover basically if you look at the tarot
there&#39;s a lot of different
like archetypes you can connect to
there&#39;s even people within our own
Collective consciousness
I remember talking to a buddy of mine
back in the day I was actually an old
assistant of mine and uh he was telling
me that he was he loved Conor McGregor
so he would like walk like Conor
McGregor he would work out like Conor
McGregor and he said that literally he
felt like his because Conor McGregor has
a very big back he&#39;s like very good back
um like muscles and stuff and he&#39;s like
his back became bigger and he felt like
he was becoming it
and I always thought that was kind of
interesting
but there are these archetypes within
our Collective Consciousness that we can
begin to become aware of and that&#39;s kind
of what Bashar hinted at there are these
these uh archetypes within our reality
that we can tune to
and if we want to
reap the benefits of certain qualities
we want to embody more of Courage
vulnerability these are all different
like empowerment
and we can begin to then tune to these
now one other thing I want to talk about
that I believe that is very much kept
within a certain
that has kept people within a certain
energy is that of group intention
and when a lot of people are in fear I
believe that they&#39;re also easier to
so that&#39;s why I think 99.9 of everything
you see on the news is negative
keeps people contracted keep people in
fear it&#39;s a pendulum
and when you withdraw your energy from
it you can then put it towards your
goals you can put it towards what you&#39;re
passionate about you can grow more
energy there
and that&#39;s why one thing that I like to
do at my Live Events and we do in
general these group ohm activations
which funny enough by the way we do
these alms where we all own like
hundreds of us if not thousands of us
will own at a certain frequency activate
the energy in our hearts and connect to
everyone on the planet that&#39;s doing it
at the same time
and that as we do that
it like amplifies our heart energy
creates more mind heart coherence and it
TAPS in a group intention group
intention is also like from the book
Think and Grow Rich
where it talks about that of The
Mastermind Principle when one person&#39;s
focused on something there&#39;s a certain
energy when two people focus on
something that energy grows when three
or more people are focused on one
outcome it&#39;s like you have more people&#39;s
thought energy growing that vision
it&#39;s very powerful
that&#39;s why masterminds are so big
they&#39;re people that are focused on a
similar outcome and you benefit from the
collective energy of it
so what happens is that is in a way by
doing and having people that are focused
on opening their hearts doing these own
activations what I was going to say is
there&#39;s this thing called resonant
tuning where in these meditations some
kind sometimes it&#39;d be kind of freaky
listening to these meditations because
at a certain point you&#39;re supposed to go
do this like thing while you&#39;re in
meditation and it sounds kind of scary
you&#39;re listening to you&#39;re listening to
other people like a course like a choir
doing this ah it feels like kind of I
remember the first time I listened to I
was like this is kind of weird maybe
I&#39;ll turn my lights on a little bit
but in general it&#39;s resonant frequency
tuning for elevating your frequency and
tuning your your the cells in your body
now when many people get together with
one unified intention and activate their
heart energy with a specific outcome it
is very powerful
now enter uh something else that I find
very interesting is I have these
meditations on YouTube and I have met so
many people that have shared with me
crazy things about what&#39;s happened from
listening to them I&#39;m like why is this
happening for example I met someone in
Costa Rica recently that was at a
retreat that said that that they
listened to that of
the meditation how to you know raise
your dominant vibration permanently by
listening to this meditation it has
almost like two million views on YouTube
they said that they listen to this
meditation on 420
and remember the date and they said that
they simply believed that they were
going to shift and raise their dominant
vibration permanently and this person
was depressed
said they were depressed they couldn&#39;t
break that those that like energy of
depression
felt confused she did this meditation
and literally said she was never
depressed again years later I see her at
this Retreat and she said she was never
depressed again her dominant vibration
did raise
and it was a simple it was a meditation
for raising your dominant vibration
permanently and I thought to myself why
these meditations so powerful
and then I thought about I was like did
you read the comments to this meditation
and she said yes she&#39;s like it you see
thousands of comments from this
meditation of people saying their lives
changed their vibration raised and their
genuine comments from people I think
what happens is people then see that it
increases the belief it can happen for
them and then in the meditation there&#39;s
certainty that you&#39;re going to shift and
then you do
so in a way it&#39;s like there&#39;s belief
here like our beliefs create our reality
even Beyond beliefs it&#39;s who are you
what is your identity but your world
view begins to change when you realize
that reality is like Holograms it&#39;s
literally you are shifting based on your
energy to different reality potentials
based on the energy you are embodying
so meditations are one of the most
powerful way of transforming your life
to feel and to tap into the possibility
of a new version of you
so when I&#39;m talking about this I&#39;m
talking about the Gateway experience
these you know 500 that I spent on these
back in 2017 basically the one that has
had the most powerful impact on me is
called patterning or re-patterning
and repatterning is connecting to the
frequency of this new you
it&#39;s visualizing it if it&#39;s as if it&#39;s
here now being it and understanding that
reality is just different everything&#39;s
vibrate in a different frequency as you
change your energy you change your life
realize there are thought structures
there are thought forms there&#39;s a reason
the news is negative there&#39;s I believe
that I&#39;m not trying to be conspiracy
theory like put fear into you I&#39;m just
saying be aware of where you put your
be aware of the pendulums you&#39;re buying
into I know when I watch Breaking Bad
that&#39;s a pendulum I&#39;m buying into but
the show&#39;s so damn good I don&#39;t even
same with Game of Thrones same with
stranger things
I&#39;ll just list off all the shows I&#39;ve
ever watched
but in general become aware of how that
might be influencing your consciousness
awareness really is the key here
but also be aware of the other side of
this don&#39;t try to force it
yeah cause it&#39;s called he engages in
this resonant tuning as it&#39;s called by
humming along with the core a course of
such sounds that are contained in the
Gateway tape following this the
participant is exposed to the Gateway of
affirmation and is encouraged to repeat
it to himself as he hears it repeated on
the tape there&#39;s these there&#39;s these
phrases you say like I deeply want to
expand my Consciousness and there&#39;s like
these affirmations that you say
in general though
what we can learn from all these these
CIA documents all this hidden esoteric
information is that I believe there are
people on the planet that know and if
you keep people within a certain level
of Consciousness you keep them kind of
disempowered feeding the pendulums of
the things that you want however you
gain your power back as you become aware
of it as you stop feeding it as you
ignore it as you put it into your ideal
reality understand that meditation may
be the missing key to you really
transforming your life and experiencing
the reality you want if you want a
