          <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
            <div class="text-blue-50 whitespace-pre-wrap">Based on the text provided, here&#39;s a concise summary:

The speaker claims Ghislaine Maxwell has significant leverage over Donald Trump and is being given preferential treatment in prison. Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas where she allegedly influences prisoner transfers. When an inmate criticized Maxwell for being a sex trafficker, that inmate was moved to maximum security the next day.

The Trump administration released Maxwell&#39;s testimony where she portrays both Trump and Epstein favorably, claiming Trump was &#34;cordial&#34; and that Epstein wasn&#39;t &#34;creepy&#34; but just liked younger women for their &#34;musical taste.&#34; Maxwell received immunity for this testimony.

The speaker argues this contradicts extensive evidence of Trump&#39;s connections to Epstein, including documented parties at Mar-a-Lago, flight records, and witness testimonies. They view Maxwell&#39;s testimony as an attempt to whitewash Trump&#39;s relationship with Epstein while the administration avoids releasing the full Epstein files.

The speaker concludes that having a convicted sex trafficker vouch for Trump&#39;s innocence represents a moral failure by the DOJ.

          <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
            
              <p class="mb-4">Gilain Maxwell has essentially checkmated Donald Trump into submission. She's got the goods on him. She's used the goods on him. She's cornered him like a rat.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">She's basically running the prison right now, the minimum security facility that she was transferred in uh in Camp Bryan, Texas. If any of the prisoners say negative things about her, Gileain Maxwell basically has them moved to the maximum security facilities. And so, the Daily Mail got this crazy exclusive where a woman who was in the minimum security facility, said that she didn't like child sex traffickers like Elaine Maxwell, who don't belong in that facility to be there. And then boom, the next day she's moved to a maximum security facility where sex traffickers are because you can't say mean things about Gileain Maxwell who got a waiver because she's not allowed to be in that facility in Brian, Texas, but she was moved there.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So you have Gileain Maxwell now running that prison system and basically running the Trump regime at this point, right. What was the big thing that the Trump regime put out on Friday in order to distract from the fact that they're not turning over the Epstein files that have Donald Trump's name all over it. They release Gilain Maxwell's audio and written transcript with Donald Trump's former criminal defense attorney, Todd Blanch, where Gileain Maxwell sits with him for two hour for two days over 10 hours. Um, she gets immunity from the Trump regime and she's like, "Oh, as far as I've always known, Donald Trump is quite the gentleman.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Quite the gentleman. I've always thought he was a very good guy." And really, I don't even know him that well. My It was my father who knew him. I'm not really sure how we all met each other in the first place, but that's about the extent of it.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">How about Gileain that you literally sex trafficked children. Okay. and you found children at the Mara Lago spa like Virginia Juy and then you and Epstein sex traffic them. Oh, by the way, with respect to Jeffrey Epstein um sexually assaulting underage girls and sex traffic underage girls, you want to know what Gileain Maxwell said in that uh transcript.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">She said, "Well, you know, I I it wasn't really a sexual thing so much as he he just he he liked to be with those girls because they taught him music. They taught him music and they taught him musical compositions and he he's not a creepy guy. Epstein's not a creepy guy. And I'm watching all of this and and hearing this and I'm like, our DOJ, this sickot Trump DOJ is literally in bed with a child sex trafficker who they moved to this Camp Brian facility who now is telling other prisoners what they can and can say.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And now Gilain Maxwell's like a moral authority in the Trump regime to try to vouch for the fact that Donald Trump allegedly did not have a strong relationship with Epstein when we have seen all of the facts. We've seen Donald Trump partying with Epstein licking his lips like looking at girls and licking his lips. We know that Donald Trump and Epstein threw parties together at Mara Lago where they said that VIP modeling agencies would be there, but it was just Trump and Epstein and like 30 girls of indeterminate age who were brought there. What do you think they were doing with them.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">You think they were doing hopscotch over there at Mara Lago. You think that's what was taking place. There's audio of Donald Trump's or or there's there's quotes of Donald Trump saying that Epstein's a great guy who likes beautiful women on the younger side. Donald Trump's on Epstein's plane over seven times.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Mara Lago was a location where Epstein and Gilane would use to sex traffic girls. Epstein would bring sex traffic girls to Trump's casinos. We know that because we've seen those deposition transcripts. Epstein and Gilain brought a 14-year-old victim of Gilain who testified against Gileain to Mara Lago.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And then according to the 14-year-old girl, Jane Doe, uh Epstein said to Donald, "Hey, you like this one. You like this one. We know from Marie and Annie Farmer, sisters who were victims of Epstein, that uh Donald Trump would show up to Epstein's victim. Marie Farmer was right there and then uh Donald Trump would look at her up and down and then Epstein would say, "Oh, no.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">That one's not for you. Just go go into the other room." Or or words to those effect. We know that Donald Trump would go into his beauty pageant locker rooms of girls of indeterminant age and he would inspect them. He said that he was an inspector and he was the owner of the pageant.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So, you get to inspect these women or girls naked. You just get to look at them naked, he says. And so, you know what. What was the headline from Politico yesterday.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">He's clean. MAGA welcomes Maxwell testimony. He's clean. As though Gilain Maxwell's now the authority on like we don't fall for this crap.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Here's the exclusive from the Daily Mail. Inmate at Gileain Maxwell's Cushy New Prison is booted to grim lockup after slamming her in interview. An inmate at Gileain Maxwell's Cushy New Prison has been abruptly transferred to a higher security facility after publicly criticizing the convicted sex trafficker. The Daily Mail can reveal Julie Howell, who is serving a one-year sentence for theft, was removed from federal prison camp Brian in Texas after blasting Maxwell as disgusting in an interview with a British newspaper earlier this month.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">According to Howell's lawyer, Patrick Mlan, prison warden, Dr. Tanisha Hall, called the 44year-old Texas native into her office and informed her she was being moved immediately. Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail, Mlan said, "Haul told how you've ruined my weekend and complained about her phone blowing up over the controversy because she criticized Elaine Maxwell for being a sex trafficker in the facility where she doesn't belong." Howell then was then booted out by Brian so fast, she didn't even have time to collect her medication or her glasses. She's now being held at the Grim Federal Detention Center in Houston, where inmates are more violent and the conditions are far worse.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">In another twist, Howell only decided to speak up because one of her family members was a victim of sex trafficking, the crime for which Maxwell received a 20-year sentence. So, a woman who actually belonged in the woman's minimum security facility was upset that a sex trafficker who didn't belong there was brought in there. This woman who belonged in there had a family member who was a victim of sex trafficking and spoke to a British newspaper saying, "We shouldn't have sex traffickers here in our facility." And that was now deemed offensive to the Trump regime. So then she gets moved to a maximum security facility that actually has these sex traffickers.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">It's the world turned upside down right now and it is utterly utterly despicable. And as I mentioned, one of the things that Gileain Maxwell said, um, her bizarre defense was she challenged the idea that Epstein, you know, would use these young girls just for sex, saying that Epstein preferred them, provided they were of legal age, because they were invigorating and would turn him on to new music. If he had been creepy, I don't think the woman would have been there, Maxwell claimed. So, Gilain Maxwell says that she thinks that Jeffrey Epstein was not creepy.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">He was creepy is not the right word. He was a sex trafficker of children. He was a pedto. So, are you gain.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">You're a convicted sex trafficker. What are we even doing here. And the DOJ is giving her immunity. They gave Guileain Maxwell immunity.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">As our editor Ron Philipsky writes, Maxwell now says she's innocent. Maxwell says Trump is innocent. Maxwell says Epstein just liked uh women who were not underage, just younger women for their musical their musical taste. Maxwell says all the victims are liars.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">This is what you have to believe to accept her as credible. All of it. But here's the thing. We should unfortunately expect a convicted sex trafficker who's basically sentenced to serve their rest of their life in prison to be a liar.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">That's that's what they have. Low character, no character, sex trafficking character. They're bad people. Of course, they're going to lie.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">But the fact that our DOJ lowered itself to put Gilain above them, that is the is a moral outrage. what's taking place in plain view. Now, we don't have what's in the Epstein files cuz Trump hasn't released that stuff and we know that his name has been redacted anyway. But what just happened in public with Gain Maxwell giving her immunity, queen for a day treatment, moving her to this facility, allowing her to kick out people she doesn't like from the minimum security facility.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">What the hell is happening here, people. Here's how they desri here's what uh here's how they described it on CNN first. play this &gt;&gt; Maxwell notably denies that any wrongdoing took place on her behalf. Uh something that contradicts what we've heard from victims and clearly what she was convicted of.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&gt;&gt; Here's what Gileain Maxwell said about Donald Trump. As far as I'm concerned, President Trump was always very cordial. Cordial man. Oh, you cordial.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Very cordial with you, sex trafficker. Gain very cordial with you. Here, play this clip. What's what did you observe as far as President Trump and his relationship with you or Mr.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Epstein. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to say for my relationship with President Trump, relationship's a big word, but I just want to say that I met him or I believe I may have because of my father in the '90s. And as far as I'm concerned, um, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find I I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now and I like him and I've always liked him.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So that is the summon substance of my entire relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Um and then Todd Blanch just look at the way these questions are loaded. We talked a few minutes ago about the birthday book that Donald Trump allegedly wrote a letter to Epstein saying, you know, Enigma, you know, it's our little secret. You know, all this creepy actual creepy stuff.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And Gileain's like, I do not remember. I do not remember anything. I do not recall. Here, play this clip.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">We talked a few minutes ago about this birthday book that there's been press about. I understand you don't remember anything with President Trump or a lot about the book anyway. Um, do you remember asking President Trump to submit a letter for &gt;&gt; I do not. &gt;&gt; And then she goes, "The president was never inappropriate here playing this &gt;&gt; I don't recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody in the times that I was with him. He was a gentleman in all respects.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">&gt;&gt; What about a list or a black book. Uh Donald Trump's name, Donald Trump's do 174. You ever see a black book. No.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Never seen such a list. Never seen anything. Here, play this clip. During the time that you were with Mr.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Epstein and even in the 2000s when you were around less frequently, you never observed or you never saw any sort of list or black book or a list of individuals who um you know linked to certain massuses or anything like that. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. No, &gt;&gt; there is no list. So that's what she said while she was in the Tallahassee maximum facility where she belong.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">She was then moved to the minimum security facility. Now she has a say over who remains in the minimum security facility. Again, let me give you the receipts and let me give you the facts. Gilain Maxwell was like best friends with Donald Trump.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">like best bestie bestie best friends from the late 80s 90s to about 2003 2004 right around the time where she broke up with Epstein. Epstein remade friends with Donald Trump for about 2 or 3 years after that. He ended up having a falling out with Donald Trump over a real estate deal where Epstein wanted to buy a property for like $34 million cash. Donald Trump scooped him, bought it for $40 million in cash.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Trump turned around two years later, sold it to a Russian oligarch for two times what Trump uh purchased it for. To which Epstein thought, could this be money laundering. Could this have been some scam with this Russian oligarch. Epstein starts threatening Trump.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Epstein believes Trump is the one who tips off the Miami police and the state police about Epstein sex trafficking. Epstein thought that Trump could have been the mole. they have a falling out and then the rest is history. But but that's something that's interesting too.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Maybe Alex Acasta, who was the United States attorney at the time who gave the nonprosecution agreement, knows a few things like that. But for Gileain to act like, "Oh, I barely knew him. He's just such a the president. I don't know him.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I don't recall. We just see him at social gatherings." It is so utterly unfathomably But there you have it. Hit subscribe. Let's get to 6 million.</p>
