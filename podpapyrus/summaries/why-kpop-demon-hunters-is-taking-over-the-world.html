Oh, Anyong. So, Netflix made a movie
called K-pop Demon Hunters, and as a
half Korean myself, I&#39;m taken aback by
all of this hype. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re
in this boat, but I recently watched
K-pop Demon Hunters for the second time.
My wife won&#39;t stop talking about it, and
she wants to see it for a third time,
and it&#39;s only been a couple of days
since she last saw it. I hear the
soundtrack all the time echoing through
my house, and my son keeps singing,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#34;You&#39;re my soda pop. My little soda pop.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s only three. Are any of you at home
experiencing this K-pop demon hunters
phenomenon? Or are you like me a couple
of weeks ago and you hadn&#39;t even heard
of this Netflix juggernaut? Let me know
in the comments. I just had to talk
about this because when was the last
time a movie made people go into a
frenzy like this? Especially one that
wasn&#39;t heavily marketed. For those of
you who haven&#39;t watched the movie yet,
K-pop Demon Hunters is a movie about a
K-pop girl band called Huntress, led by
lead vocalist Roomie, dancer Meera, and
rapper Zoey. They use their secret
identities as demon hunters to protect
their fans from the demon world spilling
over into the human realm. But they have
to face their biggest enemy yet, an
irresistible rival boy band of demons in
disguise. I was introduced to this movie
by my sister and when I heard the plot
of it, I got to admit that I was
skeptical. And I&#39;m at my parents house
in the basement working out and stuff.
She&#39;s like, &#34;Look, I have a proposal. I
think you should watch this. Okay. How
about how would you feel if we watched
this tonight?&#34; And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I think you should talk about on the
podcast because this is and she talked
about how it was number one and it&#39;s a
cultural phenomenon, too. And she didn&#39;t
have to do too much convincing. I did
want to see what all of this was about.
Based on the trailer, it seemed more
girly and it seemed I didn&#39;t really know
what to expect. I just thought it might
be for more juvenile like a juvenile
audience. I didn&#39;t expect it to be as
good as it was.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And actually, right after we saw it,
Gina was like, I got to see it again cuz
uh you know, like it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those
movies you do you don&#39;t mind seeing it.
My sister was in town and she saw it
three times.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Your dad saw it twice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Johnny, her husband, saw it three times.
He didn&#39;t complain. You know, if someone
doesn&#39;t want to watch it, they wouldn&#39;t
watch it. But what movie today do you
want want to see three times after you
just saw it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not many.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it&#39;s rare. I just appreciate the
originality. I appreciate the animation
was amazing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The animation was great. Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it had that Sony Spider-Man
vibe to it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But it was also a little different
and it was just it was just really well
done. Everything creative.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, I&#39;m not the target demographic for
this movie, I don&#39;t think. What is the
target demographic for this movie? The
primary target audience for K-pop demon
hunters is young adults, particularly
those interested in K-pop and Korean
culture. So, like young adults. But
here&#39;s the funny thing. My sister and
her husband are in their early 40s. Gina
and I are in our mid30s. My son is
three. My dad is 70. We all watched it
multiple times. It&#39;s quite a wide range
of ages there. Something&#39;s going on with
this film. It feels like a conspiracy.
Like this movie was designed in a secret
Netflix lab, launched without warning,
and then engineered to dominate your
feed. It reminds me of Josie and the
Pussycats. In that movie, an evil record
company working with government forces
secretly embed subliminal messages into
the band&#39;s music, manipulating teens to
buy products, love specific brands, you
know, brainwashing stuff. The finale
involves a concert using branded
headphones that amplify these secret
messages across the audience. The
pussycats uncover the scheme, shatter
the Megaound 8000 device, and reveal
that the industry has been using music
as a puppet string for consumer
behavior. So, what if Netflix and Sony
animation studios found a way to
brainwash everyone into loving this
movie through subliminal messages
embedded into the movie&#39;s visuals and
music that&#39;s making everyone addicted to
it? But also, it just comes down to when
you make a good story, you make a good
product, people want to watch it. It was
well done.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the reaction to immediately wanting
to watch it again cuz I I can&#39;t wait to
watch it again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know you&#39;ve been talking about it
after the last few days. And my sister,
she&#39;s like, I woke up the next day after
watching it. I listened to all their
songs for an hour. Then I went,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; she downloaded, then she watched it a
second time, but when I watched it, I
was like, this is way better than I I
ever thought it would be.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And worth the hype. That&#39;s another
thing. And thank goodness it&#39;s worth the
hype. Today, I want to figure out how
this phenomenon happened. Who made this?
Why did it take off? And are we
absolutely sure it wasn&#39;t the Mega Sound
K-pop Demon Hunters became Netflix&#39;s
most watched original animation ever.
Racking up over 130 million views since
late July 2025. And that number&#39;s only
gone up since then. All without big
marketing campaigns or tie-ins. It was a
stealth release that blew up thanks to
fanfueled verality, not corporate hype.
It&#39;s hot in here. You guys must be
hot, too. All right, so I&#39;m on this
Reddit thread right here, and it says,
&#34;What makes K-pop Demon Hunters so
addicting? I haven&#39;t been so taken by
the replay value of a movie since I was
a kid watching Frozen or something. So
much so that I wish it had a theatrical
release in my country so I can
experience on the big screen. I feel
like that movie is inherently a big
screen movie. This felt better than a
Netflix movie. It felt like something
that should be experienced in a movie
theater with a good sound system.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It deserves I think a theatrical run.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think it does too because it actually
I would be interested interested in
hearing it with a great sound system,
big screen because it it it warrants
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it to it totally does.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s so weird because the the band is
called Hunrix by the way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And I thought at first I thought
that this was a real band and they just
made a movie about them. But no, it&#39;s
all fictional. All this is original.
Fictional boy band dethrons BTS as
highest charting K-pop group in the US.
That&#39;s huge. That is huge. Despite being
fictional, the Saja Boys have achieved
real world success. As of July 3rd,
2025, they have officially become the
highest charting K-pop band in US
Spotify history. A fake band. Saja Boys
is so popular they beat out BTS on US
Spotify charts. Number one, Golden by
Hunrix. Number five, Your Idol.
Remember, this is in July. We&#39;re now in
August, but and then Sodapop. Number
seven, How It&#39;s Done by Hunrix. So, the
top 10 was infected with this movie&#39;s
soundtrack. Oh, wow. There&#39;s more.
Number 15, What It Sounds Like. Takedown
was 17. Free was 18. Holy crap. Pixar,
once the undisputed king of heartfelt
animation, is now wrestling with box
office failures, creative missteps. Why
is that? First off, Pixar&#39;s 2025
release, LEO, delivered its worst ever
opening weekend, pulling in just around
$21 million domestically and 35 million
globally against a production budget
north of $150 million. That&#39;s the lowest
opening in the studios history. Compare
that huge budget to K-pop Demon Hunter&#39;s
budget of $70 million, and you&#39;ll start
to see why more money does not equal
more creativity. Also, Pixar&#39;s risk
tolerance seems to be shrinking. Recent
films like Lightyear, Elemental, and
Strange World have underwhelmed at the
box office, prompting executives to lean
heavily into sequel announcements like
Toy Story 5 and Incredibles 3. It feels
too corporate these days, and that&#39;s a
shame. Get your together, Pixar.
So, let&#39;s look into this. How was K-pop
Demon Hunters made? Directors Maggie
King and Chris Appalons originally
pitched it as a Korean demon hunter
story and then later on layered in K-pop
elements along the way during its
development. Combining Korean demonology
and K-pop together is one of the things
I think is making this this story so in
intriguing. It&#39;s because those two
things really shouldn&#39;t fit together.
You know, those two different tones
should clash, but for some reason it
makes the story better. Maggie Kang
wanted relatable girl heroes. Ones who
burp, eat too much, argue, and crush
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait, what the mother has betrayed us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, and they did all these things with
the emoji face. Like they did these
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; anime faces where like when they when
they had a crush on one of the guys,
their their eyes would like turn into
popcorn and it would like come out of
their eyes and stuff
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then she&#39;d eat the popcorn.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And it was really great. Another
thing I liked about the Huntress band is
they&#39;re always hungry. They&#39;re always
eating a lot of food. You said you love
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The animation team mixed anime Kdrama
lighting and combined the sensibilities
of 2D animation into a 3D animation
style. It&#39;s visually chaotic in the best
way. The visuals combined with the
hypnotic music is one of the reasons
everyone is giving this movie repeat
What makes K-pop Demon Hunter so
addicting? And people are saying things
like the songs. Definitely the songs. I
don&#39;t listen to K-pop. This person
watched it like 10 times. Wow. Remember
back in the day when Titanic came out
and people were watching it like a
hundred times? This is a little like
that. This person is saying, &#34;Whoever
wrote this is no stranger to the K-pop
world as opposed to some Hollywood
writers winging it and trying to
synthesize what they think the audience
wants. As for it being addicting, I feel
that&#39;s a core characteristic of the
K-pop genre. While some of it may be
lacking in artistic merit, its main goal
is to be viral. The music an earworm.
The looks and dancing memorable. Someone
here says, &#34;If I may, I think the pace
of the film is what makes it fire. The
timing of the jokes, cute or cringe. The
songs at the correct timing. The flow of
the story line. Like this one&#39;s pretty
spot-on. The pacing is amazing. And the
music, it never feels like there&#39;s too
much. Even though the music is
throughout the movie, it the pacing is
perfect. And I heard that they deleted a
bunch of scenes in this. They deleted a
kiss scene. There was more fighting.
There was more uh there was just way
more. There was more backstory. But they
kept taking scenes out that didn&#39;t help
the story propel forward. This movie
felt really tight and in all the best
ways. It felt like it never stopped or
got boring or got bogged down. It was
the perfect amount where you wanted
more, which is a way better place to be
than wishing that the movie was over.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we also have to shout out this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cat tiger.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; spirit animal.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. And the bird.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And the bird. Those are interesting.
Really funny. This cat was funny cuz
when he appears, he&#39;s kind of
intimidating a little bit.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And he knocks over this plant and he
can&#39;t get over the fact that he knocked
it over and he keeps trying to pick it
up and it keeps falling over. picks up,
of falls over, and he just every time he
sort of gets distracted by that pot, he
really wants to put it back up. He&#39;s got
like OCD almost. We were laughing out
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The top K-pop producers from Black Label
were brought in and members from the
girl group Twice even performed the
final song Takeown, which plays
throughout the movie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, so the members of Twice sang
Takeown in the end credits of the movie,
but then the actual singers sang the
tracks throughout the movie. So we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What singers that throughout the movie?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The singers from the movie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gotcha.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t like musicals. Okay. Personally,
that&#39;s just me. I don&#39;t like musicals,
but I really like this movie. And it
doesn&#39;t it it&#39;s cuz it doesn&#39;t feel
like, you know, people are just eating
their lunch and all of a sudden they
break out into a choreographed dance
about their lunch. I love lunch. It&#39;s
half the way to dinner.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s like really catchy music that
propels the story. AC does not reach my
office. All right, you&#39;re going to have
to excuse me. When the movie premiered
on June 20th, it just quietly dropped
onto Netflix without any huge marketing
very little press. And uh in its first
weekend, it earned around 9 million
views, which is a solid start, but far
from viral. Then the momentum flipped.
In week two, it added roughly 24 million
views. Week three, another 22 million.
Week four, approximately 25 million. And
in week five, it peaked at 26.3 million
views. The first Netflix title ever to
hit its viewership peak in the fifth
week of release. So, it just kept
getting bigger and bigger, which it
usually trails downward. This trend is
going upward, which is huge for
viewership. That means word of mouth was
gigantic on this movie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s August 7th when I&#39;m recording this,
and it&#39;s number one on Netflix again.
Wow. It wasn&#39;t just popular, it was
inescapable. Okay. And take it from a
guy who doesn&#39;t even like K-pop. All
right. It&#39;s like this movie and the
music inside of it and all the colors
and visuals. It&#39;s like it had MSG. Okay.
An hour later after eating it,
you want to eat it again.
You&#39;re my soda pop. You&#39;re my soda pop.
Fans didn&#39;t just like the film. They
treated Hunrix and the Saga Boys like
real idols. Tik Toks, fan art, fanfic,
freaking AI extensions of the weirdest
variety. All of it spread awareness of
the film organically. K-pop demon
hunters, but AI ruins everything.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Powers to hunt.
[Laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What is wrong with you? What is wrong
with Why? What&#39;s with all the kissing?
[Laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, there was this music video for Your
Idol. It was a recreation done by a guy
named Danny Phantom. Uh, let&#39;s just take
a look at it. That&#39;s Stephen Haye. Or is
it Stephen He? It&#39;s that guy who does
emotional damage. Emotional damage. He
wants some therapy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. A lot of effort was put into this
thing. What I really think is
interesting here is, well, first of all,
that Steven, he is singing and dancing
here. It&#39;s just so weird because this
guy&#39;s really funny. Uh, it&#39;s just so
weird to see him as a Saja boy. Very
well done. Good production quality. But
the big thing here is that the fan
fervor here that someone decided to
remake this music video very faithfully.
Here, let&#39;s take a look at something
here. It&#39;s got 1.9 million views. It was
released four freaking days ago. The pin
comment here is, &#34;Guys, if this video
gets over a million views, we will do
Soda Pop.&#34; Well, I guess they&#39;re doing
that now. Oh, by the way, this is this
guy&#39;s biggest video, too. All right. So,
because of the mega verality of this
movie, Netflix has announced two more
sequels. K-pop Demon Hunters to get
sequels, expanded universe to include
musical, and a liveaction remake. Now,
I&#39;m most excited to see this play out as
an animated trilogy, cuz that&#39;s that&#39;s
where this movie&#39;s strong suit is. The
animation, the music, and what we got so
far. I want to see that continue. I&#39;m
less interested in the musical, the live
musical, the liveaction remake of it.
Like, why do why do we need that
Hollywood? They can&#39;t help but turn
everything into an interconnected
universe. Look, here&#39;s the thing. As a
half Korean, it&#39;s nice to see Korean
culture leaking into the mainstream in a
bigger way. And not because it&#39;s like
forced diversity. It just seems like
there&#39;s cool ideas coming from places
like Korea, okay? You got movies like
Train to Busousan, Parasite, Squid Game,
and now K-pop Demon Hunters, which was a
complete surprise to everyone. I think
the one thing that all these films have
in common is that they&#39;re all original
stories done right. And that&#39;s what we
need. Who says original movies aren&#39;t
being made anymore? Actually, I&#39;ve said
that many times, but I&#39;m thankful to be
proven wrong here. We&#39;re all starving
for it. It&#39;s true. I mean, like, that&#39;s
what we want. We want original
storylines that don&#39;t feel like
corporate poop houses. If you enjoyed
this video, take a sword to the butt.
