Let&#39;s just go go ahead and move on to
Bill Maher and then we can talk more
about this. Um, but in any case, he had
a take on his show over the weekend
which in my opinion is interesting for a
variety of reasons. Um, let&#39;s go ahead
and take a listen to that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know if I was the first one to
use the phrase slowmoving coup. I know I
was using it before he was
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
I know I was using it before he was
president the first time. So maybe
somebody got to it first. I don&#39;t know.
Uh, and people were laughing at it. I
mean, whenever I said he was never going
to concede power, they would say, &#34;Oh,
you smoke too much pot.&#34; Well, turned
out I smoked just the right amount of
pot. He does this magic trick. You know,
he&#39;s passing out pizza and it&#39;s all
about big balls and we&#39;re all laughing
at what&#39;s going on in DC.
Yeah, he&#39;s passing out pizza to the
troops. If there was a slowmoving coup,
let me just describe some of the steps
and you tell me if I&#39;m being paranoid.
Uh, first, create a masked police force.
Get people look used to looking at that.
Uh, normalize snatching people off the
street, get them used to that. Uh,
normalize seeing the car, the National
Guard and the military on the street.
Then start talking about crime in the
capital, which is basically, you know,
has always been a fairly crimeridden
city. This is our nation&#39;s capital where
elections are decided. And then have
because the crime is so bad, have other
states start sending their troops, not
just the National Guard there in DC, but
now at least six other states are
sending their troops, which then Trump
can then federalize.
So you&#39;re having many states troops on
the ground there and now they&#39;re under
federal control. So you have in the
capital a sort of permanent police
Um, so when an election dispute might
come up, just hypothetically,
I mean, I don&#39;t want to be a big
pessimist and I I&#39;m going to pretend for
the rest of the adoration that the
Democrats do have a chance of winning
and they might win the next election. I
just don&#39;t think they&#39;re ever going to
take power because this is what&#39;s going
to happen because I think this coup is
going to go off a lot smoother than the
last one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what do you make of that, Saga? Uh,
well, it just makes a lot of sense that
if you believe that to go uh to the
White House and to have dinner with that
person. That&#39;s why I&#39;m like, Bill, come
on here, man. I mean, look, you can he
can&#39;t have it both ways. You&#39;re either
literally a fascist who&#39;s trying to take
over the country, which I don&#39;t think is
going to happen. Um, or uh you&#39;re have
we&#39;re all having dinner together and why
wouldn&#39;t I go and have dinner? I mean,
you know, it&#39;s like, look, Bill, if you
believe that, you know, would you really
quote have dinner with anybody? I don&#39;t
believe that for a second. That&#39;s why,
you know, a lot of it just really seems
to be centered around him like
personally and like his own ego. So,
he&#39;s happy to talk about soft coups or
whatever on his show. Uh but if Trump
were to invite him to the White House
tomorrow, he would probably go and then
he would, you know, say that there&#39;s a
reason why. It&#39;s cuz we all need to have
conversations and it&#39;s like which what
are we doing here, man? Um and it&#39;s
funny cuz for me to be saying this, but
I&#39;m just I I for me I hate
inconsistency. I hate people who are
obviously just so wrapped up in their
own ego and blowing with the wind. I
mean, Bill Maher is probably, you know,
the most like the best example of
blowing, you know, whichever way the
tide turns. He&#39;s trying to return to
some more of his original like more
liberal roots and appear heterodox, but
he was basically like a right-winger for
a year, right? The right was the
election. Yeah. which is humiliating for
them because they&#39;ll take one one guy
says something like, &#34;Oh my god, he&#39;s
making so much sense.&#34; Bill Mah. Anyway,
that&#39;s my own personal pet peeve. But
yes, that&#39;s my Bill Mah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, and it wasn&#39;t just any dinner.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He was That&#39;s right. What was it? Kid
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He did and he did Dana White was there,
but then afterwards he did a whole
monologue about how charming Trump was
and how funny he was and how why can&#39;t
this guy be like the public guy, you
know? I mean it was very fawning and um
so and the other thing is to your point
about the self-importance.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean these people act like they&#39;re
like diplomats on some sort of a
sensitive government mission. It was the
same thing with Joe Amika. The way they
phrased when they did their little trip
to Mara
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to Maraago.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He acts like this, you know, comedian
with a once a week show going and
meeting with Trump at Mara Lago is like
the Camp David Accords. I mean it&#39;s just
it&#39;s so silly. It&#39;s so preposterous. But
then, yeah, if you do that and then you
turn around and say, which by the way, I
agree with what he&#39;s saying here, you
know, his language of it&#39;s a soft coup,
a slowmoving coup. I think that
everything he said is reasonable
considering what we experienced and saw
on January 6th and you know the fact
that there&#39;s a concerted plan now to
roll out National Guard troops in blue
cities and blue states across the
country but you don&#39;t have a lot of
credibility on that when you&#39;re doing
the like you know the nicy nice with him
as well. So, I just want to say this
again comes to the the difficulty that I
have in trying to accurately assess the
threat posed by the Trump administration
because on the one hand, like we&#39;re here
in DC, the National Guard deployment is
buffoonish. Like, it&#39;s silly. It&#39;s
ridiculous. They&#39;re, you know, they&#39;re
at MRAPs at Union Station and apparently
on the National Mall and like roaming
around Georgetown Cupcake. I&#39;m seeing
videos of them just like going up and
down escalators. It&#39;s ridiculous. On the
other hand, um they are going to be
armed apparently starting this week. You
know, it&#39;s not hard to imagine some sort
of disaster, disastrous conflration
which creates way more chaos, way more,
you know, violence or way more backlash
or whatever it is. And part of you has
to wonder if that&#39;s not part of the
point, right? if that&#39;s not part of the
desire is trying to stoke this sort of
animosity and chaos in the streets. And
then you do all he makes the point
specifically about elections and I think
it&#39;s that one is a fair one too like are
we going to have this armed force in
blue cities when it comes to election
day to try to intimidate Democratic
voters from going to the polls. I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s preposterous to suggest,
especially as right now we see the
president manifesting concern about the
midterms, saying he wants them to try to
get a hundred new Republican seats,
already casting doubt on mailin ballots,
which by the way, he did excellent with
mail and ballots. He would have lost the
election because of boomers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He would have lost the election without
mail and ballots last time around. But
in any case, this is all about stoking
concern and being able to say after the
fact that it was rigged. We see him
going to red states and saying, &#34;You
need to create new maps so we can get
more Republican seats.&#34; So all of that
is to say he&#39;s clearly concerned about
the midterms. You now have this, you
know, armed militarized force being
deployed in cities across the country.
It isn&#39;t crazy to say, well, what is
this all aiming towards? And um you know
you have the the buffoonery and the like
idiocy on the one hand and on the other
hand you have a record of genuinely like
nefarious plots executed you know by
this uh administration and Trump being
much more sort of uh unleashed this time
around than the first time around. So I
do I do give credence to what Bill is
saying there even as I acknowledge he&#39;s
not the best messenger at this point. I
would say it is incorrect to rule a lot
of that stuff out considering a lot of
the ways the administration has acted in
its first n months. I think the greatest
danger is actually some sort of
spontaneous incident and like that&#39;s the
one which look fair. I mean you talked
about the mask thing. If you come to my
door, I mean, especially after more
recently that attack, whoever that
weirdo was, the pro-life guy who uh
dressed as a police officer with a mask,
right? And who went to those politicians
door? I mean, look, even if you&#39;re, you
know, have that on and I I&#39;m looking at
the camera, I&#39;m be like, look, name,
badge number, like who are you? You
know, like there needs to be some
serious uh vetting before you open your
door for anybody. And I would advise
that for everybody out there, especially
after that type of incident. And the
same with some sort of mass incident,
right? So exactly in that scenario, it&#39;s
dangerous and there were protocols all
over there for a reason that is setting
up the you know the ground for something
that could go very very wrong. That&#39;s
part of the reason why people look at
Ken State you know for example as you
know kind of a horror in modern American
history and it&#39;s like nobody was going
there to kill them. It&#39;s just that it
erupted in a bad in chaos and people
ended up dead. That&#39;s the issue. And you
know, like it&#39;s not like there wasn&#39;t
like genuine violence or whatever, but
the point is is that people looked at
that and said, &#34;Hey, we should not try
to normalize this.&#34; And that&#39;s exactly
what I think the danger is is that the
longer that you have, let&#39;s say, a
deployment or armed deployment or
something like this in a 90% blue city,
it does seem like it&#39;s only a matter of
time until somebody, you know, somebody
it&#39;s a private and then, you know, same
if from there and then from there, who
knows what&#39;s going to happen, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s not excusing somebody&#39;s going to
attack them or whatever. I&#39;m just, you
know, it&#39;s obvious it could happen,
right? And so that I think that&#39;s
probably the thing I would be the most
afraid. I I am most afraid of especially
for the deployment here because you just
don&#39;t know like you know things crazy
stuff can happen and has happened many
times and you have people out there you
just have no idea. I mean you had the
whole weather I was I&#39;ve been thinking a
lot about how America really reminds me
today of the 1970s and the more that we
like cling to that framework it&#39;s really
important. I mean, the weather
underground like tried to blow up the
capital, right? Like crazy. A group of
just 20 people can cause can do some
crazy and can actually cause like
some widespread social panic and chaos.
That&#39;s very possible. And then from
there, it&#39;s not just a civil liberties
question. It&#39;s really more about how and
what how are we going to deal with this
going forward? And then with the
administration, you can see like they&#39;re
not afraid of picking a fight where they
think they can come out politically on
top. From from my conversation with
them, they think this is the best thing
that they&#39;ve done so far.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They used big balls getting beaten up as
like a Reich fire to deploy the National
Guard. They did. And that&#39;s not to say
that it was like a setup. I&#39;m just
saying they used that provocation be
like, &#34;We&#39;re sending in the National
Guard.&#34; Now imagine
that that homeowner who shot the two,
you know, people who were pretending to
be law enforcement. Let&#39;s say they
actually were law. Let&#39;s say it was ICE
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; who refused to identify who came
knocking at the door and the homeowner
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or an illegal killer. We&#39;re off to the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, and the homeowner thought
genuinely these were home intruders and
you know, killed them. Imagine what this
administration would do given any sort
of a pretext for some sort of massive
crackdown. Like, we know that they&#39;ll do
it. They&#39;re already doing it based on
like, you know, a few protests with some
with a couple cars uh set on fire and
some Mexican flags and big balls getting
beat up. So, they&#39;ll use anything, you
know, I mean, we just had a situation
where one of these uh wasn&#39;t it one of
the M wraps that like t-boned a car here
in the city. Thankfully, those um the
people in the car were injured. They
were taken to the hospital, but I think
they survived are going to be okay,
which is like a miracle given what
unfolded. But again, you can imagine
like an angry crowd forming. You It&#39;s
not hard to envision the way this could
all go off the rails and the way this
administration could use that sort of
provocation for an even larger scale
crackdown. So, I think we all have to be
concerned about those possibilities
because and and concerned that that is
actively the plan. Like that&#39;s what
they&#39;re actually hoping for because
Trump loves to create the pretext of a
national emergency to grab more and more
and more power.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t think, look, I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s that far-fetched. I do think it is
dangerous just broad actually society
for that type of stuff to happen and if
it is seen by the people as that then
you&#39;re political even just politically
like you&#39;re going to suffer a lot
because that is really the question that
anyway that&#39;s just like the question I&#39;m
grappling with the most because it&#39;s
like you said too I mean here&#39;s here is
the the truth that is uncomfortable a
lot of people will choose safety over
security and we&#39;ve seen that over and
over and over and over again then
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; safety overw safety over uh freedom. The
question is about safety itself and like
what that even means. I do think there
is a deep strain especially for a lot of
America especially a lot of American
Republicans who are still furious about
BLM which I understand is to punish the
people who were responsible for that.
But you know one of the things that they
also need to grapple with is three and a
half years ain&#39;t that long of a time.
Okay. Because whatever&#39;s what&#39;s been
unleashed it&#39;s coming for you too. Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean I&#39;m from Texas. I don&#39;t know if
you remember when Obama like there was
this whole Jade Helm exercise and the
Texas National Guard was mobilized
out like I my neighbors and other people
were were like they&#39;re going to come and
invade us and like that&#39;s equally I can
see you know that strain having lived
through that of what that could look
like. You know there&#39;s no reason why a
liberal city or whatever can&#39;t do the
same thing. That&#39;s kind of a scary place
to be. That&#39;s just what I would Yeah, I
agree. Another pandemic. You ready for
Governor Gavin Newsome to send the
National Guard into your cities and
force everybody, you know, close the
churches and lock down? I don&#39;t think
Republicans are going to be excited
about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is that is the point though that
the right-wingers always point out is
like, hey, you guys are happy to use a
National Guard to close down the beach
or uh you know, to enforce all I think
they did that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I in uh in California there was law
maybe not National Guard, but there
definitely was. I think there was some
National Guard deployment for CO 19. I
forget exactly what it was for I think
it was operation warp speed but anyway
uh law enforcement closing down the
beach a lot of the stupid policies
restaurants etc. So it&#39;s like it&#39;s not
exactly as if they&#39;re like you know uh
against like a lot of authoritarian
tactics when they want it to be. That
was by the way another reason why I
think it&#39;s important to say like there
was no mass revolution in America or
anywhere in the entire west against
draconian co policies. people actually
should sit with that especially in
retrospect of how ridiculous they were
and wonder if we would all do it again.
I personally will not go along with it
again. I don&#39;t know how many people
would not go would go along with it
again and I do think that is that is an
important societal like social question
for what it means. This is interesting.
Just aside, I don&#39;t know that this is
the only deployment, but one of the
deployments of the National Guard during
COVID was red state Ohio to assist
hospitals like to assist hospitals when
you had
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he was the what&#39;s
Mike Dwine. And then obviously at the
same time you had National Guard
deployed to deal with the um George
Floyd the riots in the context of the um
of Black Lives Matter. So in any case,
