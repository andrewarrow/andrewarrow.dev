I saw her on a TV show and I had never
seen her before and I said that&#39;s it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For decades, Robert Redford seemed like
the embodiment of calm in chaos, the
gentleman of new Hollywood. While others
exploded into scandal, faded from the
spotlight or burned out under the weight
of fame, Redford stayed grounded,
golden, and above the fray, he didn&#39;t
chase headlines. He didn&#39;t trade in
gossip, and he certainly never aired
dirty laundry. But at 88, the
Oscar-winning icon has finally said what
those closest to him have quietly known
for years. There were actors who made
the work unbearable. Men he clashed with
behind closed doors, legends he simply
could not stand. And while the
performances were iconic, the
experiences behind them were anything
but. These aren&#39;t rumors. These are
names. And by the time you reach the
final one, you may never watch some of
Hollywood&#39;s most beloved classics the
same way again. One of the earliest and
most surprising names is Gene Hackman.
They first worked together on Downhill
Racer. And while their styles could not
have been more different, there was
mutual respect, at least at first.
Hackman was a powerhouse of raw
intensity, a performer who approached
each role like a battlefield. He didn&#39;t
just act, he dominated. He was known to
explode in rehearsals, challenge
directors, and disregard subtlety in
favor of brute emotional force. Redford,
whose style was quiet, deliberate, and
controlled, found Hackman&#39;s volatility
exhausting, &#34;He&#39;s one of the greats.&#34;
Redford once admitted to a colleague,
but he never cared who he steamrolled to
get there. What began as mutual
admiration in the early 70s turned into
guarded distance. Their differences
reached a breaking point during a
pivotal scene when Hackman refused to
leave his trailer over what he felt was
unflattering lighting. After nearly an
hour of delays, Redford walked over,
opened the door, and told him in front
of the crew, &#34;This isn&#39;t your movie,
Jean. It&#39;s a team effort.&#34; &#34;Show up or
step aside.&#34; Hackman did the scene, but
the two never spoke off camera again.
Privately, Redford referred to Hackman
as a sledgehammer in a violin shop. He
admired the talent, but found the
temperament unbearable. In later years,
he even vetoed Hackman&#39;s name on casting
lists, writing bluntly, &#34;Brilliant
actor, Impossible Human.&#34; Their careers
ran parallel, but they never worked
together again. When asked years later
if he regretted not teaming up more,
often with Hagman, Redford&#39;s diplomatic
reply was telling. Some pairings only
need to happen once. Another name on
Redford&#39;s list is James Woods. Unlike
Hagman, Woods and Redford never actually
made a film together, but they did cross
paths multiple times. Woods auditioned
for supporting roles in Redford&#39;s
projects more than once, and every time
the result was the same rejection.
Redford later admitted that he found
Woods deeply unsettling and almost
impossible to be around. Their political
and personal philosophies were worlds
apart, and their first meeting ended in
disaster. During an audition for a
courtroom drama, Woods challenged
Redford Midre on his views about the
Vietnam War. What should have been a
creative session devolved into a heated
debate. He brought chaos to places that
needed quiet. Redford recalled, &#34;It
wasn&#39;t just politics. It was about
energy.&#34; &#34;I wasn&#39;t interested in
managing that. Woods was brilliant, no
doubt, but his confrontational style
exhausted Redford.&#34; At one point, Woods
launched into a lecture on Cold War
policy. In the middle of a scene,
Redford reportedly closed his script and
walked out of the room. Afterward, his
casting notes next to Woods&#39;s name
contained just to words. Never ever.
Even years later, Woods occasionally
took veiled shots at Redford in
interviews, referencing Hollywood
hypocrites who preach peace but run
studios like Generals. Redford never
responded publicly, but the silent
blacklist was complete. Then there&#39;s
Dustin Hoffman. Two movie goers Hoffman
and Redford were a dream team. the
perfect pairing to bring all the
president&#39;s men to life. Together, they
immortalized the story of Woodward and
Bernstein and crafted one of cinema&#39;s
most iconic duos. But behind the scenes,
it was a grinding clash of styles.
Hoffman thrived on improvisation. He
often changed his lines, altered his
blocking, and threw in unscripted
moments to keep scenes alive. Redford,
ever the meticulous craftsman, found the
unpredictability maddening. Crew members
described the atmosphere as quietly
tense, not explosive, but uneasy.
Hoffman would rehearse a scene one way,
then shoot it completely differently,
sometimes even repositioning himself to
dominate the camera&#39;s light. One
infamous phone call sequence reportedly
took seven takes, each with a different
tone and pacing. Redford who had to
react in real time to the shifting
performances was seething by the end.
We&#39;re trying to tell a story not chased
to director Alan J. Pakula. Hoffman
never intended to frustrate his co-star.
It was simply his process but for
Redford it was enough. They were never
hostile but they also never were
together again. When asked why,
Redford&#39;s answer was simple and telling.
Once was enough. Not all of Redford&#39;s
clashes came from artistic differences.
Some came from pure philosophical
incompatibility.
When he directed Lines for Lambs in
2007, he finally worked with Tom Cruz.
The pairing seemed ideal. Redford, the
elder statesman of thoughtful American
cinema, and Cruz, the biggest box office
draw of his generation. But the
experience was a disaster. From the
start, Redford envisioned and
understated political drama about
institutional failure. Cruz approached
it like a corporate brand campaign. He
reportedly arrived at production
meetings with publicists and image
consultants, talking about market
positioning and viewer perception rather
than character and emotion. Every scene
became a negotiation over optics.
Redford was stunned to find Cruz
requesting stylists during rehearsals to
make sure his silhouette conveyed
discipline. &#34;I wanted vulnerability,&#34;
Redford later said. He wanted symmetry.
The tension boiled over during
production when crews repeatedly stopped
mid-cene to request lighting adjustments
or new line readings. By the end of the
shoot, Redford had grown openly
frustrated. One assistant remembered him
leaning over to Cruz during a take and
quietly asking, &#34;Are we acting or
selling a campaign ad, the film flopped
at the box office, and Redford walked
away calling it one of the most
frustrating experiences of his career.&#34;
He never spoke to Cruz again. Even some
of Redford&#39;s most successful films
carried behindthe-scenes tensions. Take
Three Days of The Condor, where he
starred opposite Fate Dunaway. The film
was a critical hit, but off camera the
chemistry was non-existent. Dunaway was
known for her demanding perfectionism,
deep mistress of directors and co-stars
alike. She frequently requested script
rewrites, demanded lighting changes, and
asked to review dailies. Redford, who
preferred collaboration and momentum,
found the process exhausting. He
reportedly referred to Dunaway as a
storm in heels. One day during a tense
private meeting with director Sydney
Pock, Redford finally snapped when
Dunaway questioned her character&#39;s
emotional logic. It&#39;s espionage fa not
check off. He said the room went silent.
Though the movie turned out beautifully,
the working relationship never
recovered. There were no reunions, no
nostalgic interviews, and no second
collaborations. A similar pattern
emerged with Robert Dval on The Natural.
Their approaches to acting were like oil
and water. Redford treated the film like
a symphony every moment rehearsed,
timed, emotionally calibrated. Duval
played jazz unpredictable and
improvisational. At first, Redford
admired the rawness, but as filming
progressed, Duval&#39;s adlibs and constant
emotional shifts threw off the carefully
constructed arc that Redford and
director Barry Levenson had envisioned.
Their differences finally erupted into a
shouting match during a pivotal
confrontation scene. Redford wanted
precision. Duval wanted freedom. It&#39;s
not your movie. Redford snapped. It&#39;s
not anyone&#39;s until it&#39;s real. Duval shot
back. They finished the film, but the
damage was done. Neither man ever worked
with the other again. Dot. And then
there&#39;s the name no one expected, Paul
Newman. To audiences, Newman and Redford
were one of cinema&#39;s most iconic duos.
The perfect pairing in Butch Cassidy and
The Sundance Kid and The Sting. Their
chemistry seemed effortless, their
friendship legendary. But according to
Redford, the reality was more
complicated. He admired Newman deeply,
but their relationship was never as
close as fans believed. Newman always
kept a certain distance and in Redford&#39;s
view sometimes played dumb to get away.
With more than he should have, there was
no dramatic fallout, just the slow
erosion of trust. During the sting,
Newman began exerting more producer
control, arriving to meetings with
studio executives and notes on casting,
scripts, even camera placement. Redford
felt pushed aside. He stopped being my
co-star and started being my
competition. He once confided the
dynamic never fully recovered. Though
they remained cordial and shared the
occasional public tribute, they never
made another film together. Redford
admitted years later that it wasn&#39;t
about timing or lack of opportunity. It
was about trust. Paul was the face.
Redford once said, &#34;I was the footnote.&#34;
Some of these names will surprise you.
Others may feel inevitable, but together
they reveal a truth about Robert Redford
few have ever seen. For all his poise
and restraint, he carried the scars of
collaboration like anyone else. Behind
the sunshine and iconic performances,
Redford&#39;s Hollywood had shadows, too.
And perhaps that&#39;s what makes his career
all the more remarkable. He navigated
those storms quietly, without scandal,
without spectacle. But he never forgot
the lessons.
