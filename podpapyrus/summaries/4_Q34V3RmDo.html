guys this is heavy man and this is what
they wear on their neck all true yes
when I was young I Y is about how
foreign ships used to come down to the
coast of Nigeria and take a lot of us
away as slaves like in millions to go
and work for them overseas under very
inhumane conditions off the coast of
Lagos is a place called badagri and this
place holds a significant history in the
slave trade era so I want you guys to
come along with me and uh let&#39;s see what
happens in
badagri I have long
legs but is a place where many slaves
were kept and there also a place that
tells the story of how the slave trade
started it was one of the major roots
for the transatlantic SLI trade I don&#39;t
really know a lot about the SLE trade so
I decided to go down here I meet up with
somebody whose Grandparents were alive
during the era of the SLI trade to tell
me the story about how SLI tra started
in Nigeria how far now how are you doing
I&#39;m yeah right
yeah the compound that we have is known
Brazilian baracon and baracon is a
Portuguese word Min slave cell or
Storehouse where where the slave we have
been store and the compound right now we
have to about 40 rooms in this compound
okay so this is where they kept slaves
yes in the olden days and that say each
room contain 40 40 SL this is called C
shell as you see so those are the kind
of currency our for used then this is
what they used to use as means of
exchange but when they came them say
they can do business with our for with
this kind of money right on the wall
this are some of European products that
we used in a CH for the SL when they
arrive like if European give you one
umbrella you give them 40 human being as
slave okay is this one of the rooms that
40 people yes 40 people inside here yeah
and we have 40 rooms in the company wow
this one is called cing Yol they use it
to Jo to sleep together they put this at
the ankle okay to join two slaves
together by the leg now look at that
small window Tire can you see that small
window there
and that&#39;s what we provided the
ventilation imagine 40 in for to 4
month imagine the odor the heat imagine
how many human being c will have died
here that&#39;s why people com you not here
to cash one but to feel the pain the
people the p and those are the item that
are sh on the wall each go for 10 are 50
human being look at your back there this
bottle if you look closely at the body
you see 1873 be customized on the B
human being standing guys can you
imagine the conditions that the slaves
had to live in 40 people in a room a
room that is not even enough for one
person 40 people have to stay inside
that room I can&#39;t even begin to imagine
how most of them would have fa so these
are the cannon okay 100 100 that&#39;s 200
slaves for this cannon here give you the
long one give 100 another 100 wow this
the chains they use for the slaves you
can see that&#39;s why I say you can
see put yeah yeah let me try it okay so
just tell the people how you feeling wow
this is heavy man [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] this is heavy
ouch he even drawing you guys this is
heavy man and this is what they wear on
their neck all true yes they be should
be single fire you know in the straight
this another neck another neck it could
have be like 100 of wow man guys this is
very heavy and they wear this all day
every time yeah while they&#39;re taking it
away and it&#39;s even this thing at the
back is so not comfortable yeah
and that&#39;s their drinking po here oh
this is where they drink from they don&#39;t
allow them to use cup but almost they TI
hand water wow everybody everybody go
imagine why the water get below why
struggling the can see injur the
wow just putting the chain on my neck
those chains were so heavy and it it was
hting my neck as you can see in the
video and these people had to go through
all of this and they had no choice
separated from their family separated
from everybody that they knew and sold
you can imagine how these people were
treated so now we&#39;re going to the point
of no return and for us to do that we
have to cross over this Lagoon here and
get to the other side that&#39;s where we
see the point of no return point of no
return is a point where when slaves get
to they can&#39;t come back
anymore you know bag was founded around
1425 okay by a man called ag ag ag yeah
and AG means blacks meet in euras the SL
ship which is called ship okay will be
awaiting the slave on the other side on
the other side of the that&#39;s at the
Atlantic Ocean oce yeah they will come
in get to the town get the the number of
slave that they want okay after getting
the slaves they now walk them in a
single fight down to the beach beach
they&#39;ll be in a straight troll wow and
that heavy chain will be on their necks
you know most times when they talk about
the slave trade okay it&#39;s always looking
like okay it&#39;s just only the Europeans
that were selling slaves but it kind of
seems like we Nigerians were also
selling ourselves as slaves very very
correct like me that I&#39;m standing with
you yeah my forefathers were not slave
Traer but we own slaves are you serious
yes wow okay you understand how we owns
our slave if you have a money then yeah
you can move down to the market yeah and
buy your sleeves in the market you buy
sleeves from wow so they used to sell
sleeves like like like food something
like going to Mr Big you see this is
what really happened you see it&#39;s of two
sides of it okay in some part of Congo
even part of Nigeria there&#39;s some places
that they invaded okay and they took the
people away forcefully as a slave okay
but in some part of it there&#39;s some part
where by the Africans locers or the
Chiefs the warrior they also their
facilitator they sell their own people
because when they came okay they you
know we fought what then okay you know
man want to you want to dominate your
domain your kingdom okay you understand
that is within us so like now if your
village and my Village had a fight event
if you wanton the fight you take you
take the people away as a slave to your
own town to your own town just like
understand like they do in war victim of
War you understand so they will be
working for you
yeah but when European
came they met the trade on ground oh
they met the slave trade so the slave
trade was already happening before they
arrive yeah wow they met the trade on
ground okay we been enslaving ourself
before they arrive Africa we betrayed
ourself H which is still happening up
today up to today yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s
that&#39;s where I&#39;m going to this so if you
check record go and check record or quot
me yeah most of the slave F later their
children children were the on see ruling
in Africa up today hm yeah so we see the
same system going out up till dat the
blames are on both sides sides the
European and the African afans
facilitators you understand yeah as a
child when I was growing up the story My
Own forefather my grandfather my father
used to tell me then about when we are
on the surface of I I we are very very
powerful we can disappear you can tell
the ground to open I to open how afans
yes how comes the European comes around
and force for us to do what we didn&#39;t
want to do yeah now realize that we sold
ourselves into slavery they know they to
they know that we are very very powerful
they know who we are you understand but
it seems we don&#39;t know we are we don&#39;t
know the power that we have we know that
we are very powerful out of 12 disciple
there always be a Judas Judas you
understand somebody must betray one
person you understand slave Spirit at to
Nation well well let say the water to B
stress now who do this well that&#39;s the
question this well was D by the African
sheeps H why do they have to do the
world good now the movement of Africans
to America through that it&#39;s not that
middle per they call it middle p and the
name of the slave ship is called Caro
ship which could take like 600 700 you
know it was the Portuguese that the
trade yeah most of the slave move from
Africa then the stent to Lisbon okay
this is a very big sleep Market in
Portugal then yeah where everybody get
to get their sleep then later along that
the English join and the name of the
first leip is being Jesus of Lubec or
good ship Jesus owned by King of England
then but later Queen Elizabeth rent it
out to one of s called John Hawkins and
they said taking Africans away as a
slave to walk for them and most of the
town in America even the White House was
built by black people black people now
on the SL we could have like
673 200 it depend the size of the SL and
the crew they were taking the slave away
they are no more than probably 25 to 30
they were taking like 600 or 300 SL away
so most
often why taking it away if the slave
spotted the land mhm and it aggravate
them you understand or they have any
opportunity they kill all the cre on
board they will not add the Sailor to
sell down to any available land they
will not occupy the only person they
will not K is the they ask to S back to
any AV I think that&#39;s what happen in gu
and some most of the
Caribbean all places yeah so now the
ships came up with idea what can they do
so that the SL will be less aggressive
that&#39;s where they have to do all the
world H and on the SL work in a single
without heavy chain the stop will be
here they give them the water to drink
when they consume the water we are told
that they will lose their memory wow it
wipe their memory but it&#39;s not for life
for 3 to four months it will weaken them
not that you wipe WIP their memory why
taking they can&#39;t do anything so it weak
them for 3 to four month but then they
will have sail down to Europe or America
they not regain their strength Memories
call call memory L but ironically some
say the water is still effective some
say it&#39;s not effective so if I drink if
I drink this water now I&#39;ll I&#39;ll forget
my I I&#39;ll forget my memory for the next
I don&#39;t know how four months so four
month four month but some the there some
effective not effective but we don&#39;t
know how trth this see because we never
see a single s okay let me let me try it
and see I&#39;m going Al time you see some T
say they will take it but when we get
here you the water is dir
disc so that&#39;s the way after giving the
water they now move them to the point of
return but this this well was dug by
Africans shs yeah the ships even
imp they also have one too their own in
their own is a tree like this we call it
tree of memory loss the women will go
around the tree seven time the men night
time and we told that they will lose
their M they lose their memory wow this
is the point of no return that I was
telling you guys about by the time the
slaves get here this is where the board
the ships that take them all the way to
Europe and all those other countries
where they have been sold the monument
that used to be here is this two
straight po here
this there used to be an object on top
them okay that the object symbol human
being and there&#39;s a chain thatn we call
it Ark of the parure AR of the pure pure
so when they move them they pass under
the AR of the parure this is bottom the
SL yeah one slave head here the next we
follow leg leg the reason want of
communication within there that&#39;s why so
another deck another deck the state
government came up with beautiful idea I
used to call it beautiful idea that they
should build another monument in
conjunction with the AR of the parure
and that&#39;s why they have to constru this
tunnel when tourist comes here you go in
probably there&#39;s going to be some
artwork pictures you go in as if you&#39;re
going to America you come back to Africa
oh of return no more point of return
return but this project that we seeing
here is getting more than more probably
getting to 10 years now 10 years livly
so we don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going to
complete it w it&#39;s very troubling to
listen to and see all of the things
people have been through and when you
get to this place it&#39;s not been
preserved this part of Nigeria&#39;s history
is not being preserved as it should be
the memory lost well of that the African
Chiefs built is also not been preserved
the monument at the point of no return
is practically falling apart it has been
under construction for over 10 years
that&#39;s a very long time I believe that
history plays a very important role in
the development of a country if you
don&#39;t know where you&#39;re coming from how
do you know where you&#39;re going if you
make mistakes and you don&#39;t learn from
them how do we know how to move forward
into the future how do we know how to
build the future if we&#39;re not keeping
records of all the things that have
happened in the past I believe that
within a couple years if these places
are not being preserved properly we
would have no history one of the reasons
I&#39;m doing this video is to shine a light
on the story of the slave trade in
Nigeria secondly is to Showcase BAGI as
one of the most important parts in
Nigeria&#39;s slave history I believe BAGI
should be preserved not just for
ourselves but also for the people who
are coming after us they also need to
know about where they&#39;re coming from
they also need to know their history it
was very mindblowing going back in time
to learn about how slave trade was
started in Nigeria that&#39;s all I have to
share with you if you like this video

and I&#39;ll definitely see you guys on the
next one peace
