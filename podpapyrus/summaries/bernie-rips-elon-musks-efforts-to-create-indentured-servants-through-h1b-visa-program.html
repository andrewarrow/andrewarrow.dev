Today I want to focus on one more reason
as to why the working class of this
country is struggling and that has to do
with the H1B
guest worker program.
Madame President, Elon Musk, the
wealthiest
man in the world with a net worth of
nearly $430 billion
and other multi-billionaires in the
high-tech industry claim that the H1B
federal guest worker program is vital to
our economy because of the scarcity of
highly skilled engineers and other
technology. ology workers in the United
States. In other words, what they say is
they are trying desperately to find just
highly skilled American workers to do
their jobs just can&#39;t find them. Just
not there.
And in my view, Musk and the other
billionaires who are strongly supporting
the H1B program are dead wrong. American
workers are there. They are just not
looking for them.
In my view, the main function of the H1B
program is not to hire the best and the
brightest. That&#39;s the theory. We got to
bring in the best and the brightest to
help our companies function and grow
wealth in America. Uh that&#39;s the theory.
But in truth, the reality of what the
H-1B program is is to replace good
paying American jobs with hundreds of
thousands of lower paid guest workers
from abroad who are often treated as
indentured servants.
The cheaper it is to hire guest workers,
the more money the multi-billionaire
owners of large corporations make. In
other words, this program is not only
grossly unfair to American workers, many
ways unfair to foreign workers as well.
We need an economy that works for all,
not just the few. And one small but very
important way forward in that direction
is to bring about major reforms to the
H1B program in order to benefit American
workers. And that is why I have filed an
amendment to the Lake and Riley bill
that we are debating this week that will
do just that. And I hope very much that
the leaders agree on allowing that
amendment to be debated and voted upon.
Uh, Madame President, as we go forward
in this new session of Congress,
I would hope very much that there will
be a serious focus on the crisis facing
the working families of our country.
Madame President, we are the wealthiest
nation on earth. In fact, we are the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world. And yet today, while we have more
income and wealth inequality
than we have ever had, 60% of our people
live paycheck to paycheck. The life
expectancy of working people is far
below that in other wealthy countries.
85 million Americans are uninsured or
underinsured.
Some 800,000 Americans are homeless.
25% of seniors are trying to survive on
a year or less. And we have the highest
rate of childhood poverty of almost any
major nation on earth.
Further, we remain shamefully
the only wealthy country not to
guarantee health care to all people as a
human right.
Meanwhile, Madame President, while
working families struggle to put food on
the table
and pay their bills, the wealthiest
people in our country have never ever
had it so good.
And we are now in the absurd situation,
the grossly unjust situation where the
three wealthiest people on top own more
wealth than the bottom half of American
some 170 million people. Three people on
top, more wealth than 170 million on the
Madame President, that is not what
America is supposed to be about.
And in truth, there are a number of
reasons why we are living in a nation
today where the wealth of the
billionaire class is exploding
while the working class of our country
to keep their heads above water.
There are many causes as to why despite
a huge increase in worker productivity,
real weekly wages for the average
American worker are less today than they
were 50 years ago. Real weekly wages
less than they were 50 years ago.
and why during that period that was a
$50 trillion transfer of wealth from the
bottom 90%
to the top 1%.
Now, a lot of the reasons as to why the
very rich are becoming richer and
workingclass families are struggling has
to do with disastrous trade policies
which have resulted in the loss of
millions of good paying jobs.
The failure of Congress to raise the
minimum wage to a living wage living
wage is another reason why millions and
millions of workers today are forced to
try to survive on starvation wages.
And furthermore, we are seeing and have
seen aggressive and often illegal union
busting activities on the part of major
employers.
All of those reasons and more
are issues that we have got to deal
with. According to the Economic Policy
Institute, between 2022 and 2023,
the top 30 companies using the H1B
program laid off 85,000
American workers while simultaneously
bringing in over 34,000
guest workers from abroad.
In 2019 and 2020, 85%
of H1B visas were awarded to entrylevel
and junior guest workers who are paid
between 20 to 40% less than American
workers in similar occupations. So
number one,
it is simply not true that the H1B
program focuses on the very rare and
highly skilled workers that American
companies cannot find.
uh 85% to repeat of H-1B visas were
awarded to entrylevel and junior guest
workers and they are paid 20 to 40% less
than American workers in similar
occupations. And let me just give you a
few examples as to how unfair
uh the H1B program is in Dallas, Texas.
H1B software developers are making
less than American workers doing the
exact same job. This is from uh
information from the US Department of
Labor in Houston, Texas. H1B
accountants. I did not know, to be
honest with you, that we had a scarcity
in accountants. But be that as it may,
our H-1B accountants are paid nearly
$40,000 less than American accountants
doing the exact same work. In Santa
Barbara, California,
H1B workers who are hired as computer
system engineers make just $45,000
a year. Uh, does that sound like the
kind of salary that would bring forth
some extremely highly skilled people uh
for jobs that American workers cannot
Uh, Madame President, uh, you tell me,
why would a corporation hire an American
computer systems engineer at a salary of
$110,000 a year when it is $65,000
cheaper to hire an H1B worker for that
sa same exact position? That&#39;s basically
what this whole debate is about and that
is that large corporations are paying
foreign workers substantially
lower salaries than they are paying
American workers.
Madame President, if you want to know uh
why multi-billionaire owners of
high-tech companies love the H1B program
so much, that is the reason why they are
using this program to substantially
undercut the wages of American workers.
Moreover, Madame President, there are
that as many as 33%
of all new information technology jobs
in America are being filled by guest
workers. And according to the Census
Bureau data, there are millions of
Americans with advanced degrees in
science, technology, engineering, and
math who are not currently employed in
those professions. In other words, we
tell kids go out
uh get involved in STEM work, become a
scientist, become an engineer,
uh become a mathematician, whatever. And
then we bring in people from abroad to
fill the jobs that they were educated to
Adding insult to injury,
half of the top 30 H1B employers are
companies whose major function in life
is to outsource jobs, known in the
industry as body shops. In other words,
the same companies that are involved
with supplying American companies with
cheap foreign labor at home are the same
exact companies that provide even
cheaper labor to corporations when they
move abroad.
They are two sides of the same coin.
Madame President, if there is truly a
major shortage of skilled tech workers
in this country, as Elon Musk and others
have argued, why did Tesla lay off over
7,500 American workers last year,
including many software developers and
engineers at its factory in Austin,
Texas, while at the same time applying
to hire thousands of H1B be guest
workers. If these jobs are only going to
the best and the brightest,
why has Tesla employed H1B guest workers
as associate accountants
for as little as 58,000 a year,
associate mechanical engineers for as
little as 70,000 a year, and associate
material planners for as little as
80,000 a year.
Now, Madame President, I will admit I am
not a rocket scientist, but to my mind,
those occupations don&#39;t sound like
highly specialized jobs that are
primarily for the top onetenth of 1%
as Mr. Musk claimed last month.
Madame President, if this program is
really supposed to be about importing
workers with highly advanced degrees in
science and technology,
why are H-1B guest workers being
employed as fashion models,
lawyers, dog trainers, massage
therapists, cooks, and English teachers?
One might think that in the United
States of America uh we could find
English teachers and not need to bring
in people from abroad.
And further uh does anyone really
believe uh that in America we do not
have enough lawyers and need to bring in
more attorneys from a board? Uh, Madame
President, at a time of massive income
and wealth inequality,
uh, we need fundamental changes in our
economic policies. Let me very briefly
describe what this amendment does in
terms of reforming the H-1B program.
First, this amendment would double the
major H-1B fee that corporations pay
before they can hire guest workers from
abroad. This provision would generate
over $370 million in revenue each year.
And what would we use that revenue for?
Well, it would be used to provide nearly
scholarships each and every year for
American student students pursuing
advanced degrees in science, technology,
engineering, math, and other fields
vital to the competitiveness of our
If the members of this body truly
believe we need H1B, H-1B visas in order
to compensate for a shortage of skilled
American professionals. This amendment
will attract tens of thousands of
America&#39;s best and brightest young
people into those fields.
Second, this amendment requires
corporations to substantially increase
wages for the jobs they need before they
would be allowed to hire H1B guest
workers. Specifically, this amendment
would raise the prevailing wage for the
H-1B program to at least the median
local wage. In other words, if the H-1B
program is truly meant for the best and
the brightest, it should not be used as
a tool to undercut the wages of highly
skilled American workers. And that is
what this amendment would prevent.
Third, this amendment would prohibit
corporations from replacing laidoff
American workers with H1B guest workers
from overseas.
Corporations that are engaged in mass
layoffs should not be allowed to replace
American workers with guest workers.
Finally, this amendment would prevent
corporations from treating H-1B guest
workers as for all intent and purposes
indentured servants. Under current law,
H-1B guest workers are often locked into
lower paying jobs and can have their
visas taken away from them by their
corporate bosses if they complain about
dangerous, unfair or illegal working
conditions. That is unacceptable and
that has got to change. This amendment
would make
H1B visas portable and give guest
workers the ability to easily change
Madame President, uh Mr. Musk and Mr.
Ramaswami and others have argued that we
need a highly skilled and welleducated
workforce. I agree.
But the answer is not to bring in cheap
labor from abroad through the H-1B
program. The answer is to hire qualified
American workers first and to make
certain that we have an education system
that produces the kind of workforce that
our country needs for the jobs of the
future. Bottom line, it must never be
cheaper for a corporation to hire a
guest worker from overseas than an
American worker at home. And that is
what this amendment is all about.
Madame President, let&#39;s be clear. 30
years ago, the leaders of corporate
America, the political establishment in
both major parties and the editorial
boards of the most influential papers in
our country told us not to worry about
the loss of millions of bluecollar
manufacturing jobs that would come as a
result of unfeted free trade agreements
like NAFTA and permanent normal trade
relations with China. Don&#39;t worry about
the loss of those jobs.
And the reason they told us not to worry
is that that job loss would be more than
offset by the many good paying white
collar information technology jobs that
would be created in the United States.
Yes, they said you&#39;ll lose blue collar
manufacturing jobs, but not to worry. we
will create zillions of goodpaying white
collar information technology jobs. I
personally was a member of Congress at
that time never believed that and I
helped lead the effort against NAFTA and
PNTR with China. Unfortunately, I and
the many others who opposed those trade
agreements were proven correct.
NAFTA and PNTR cost us millions of good
paying manufacturing jobs as large
corporations shut down here in America
and fled to China, Mexico, and other
low-wage countries in search of cheap
labor. And what about all of those great
high-tech jobs
that supposedly were going to be
created? Well,
that didn&#39;t quite happen either.
As a result of the H-1B guest worker
program and other guest worker programs,
major corporations are now importing
hundreds of thousands of lower paid
guest workers from abroad to fill the
white collar technology jobs that are
currently available. In other words,
heads billionaires win, tails, American
workers lose.
In my view, we can and must change that
reality. And a good place to start would
be be would be to pass this amendment
and put American workers first.
Multi-billionaires in big tech should
not be allowed to hire guest workers to
fill entry level and midlevel
information technology jobs. Those jobs
should be going to American workers who
have, among other things, the
constitutional right to form unions and
collectively bargain for better wages,
benefits, and working conditions.
Madame President, I will be asking for a
roll call vote on this amendment. And I
hope very much we can get it to the
floor. In my view, the time has come for
the American people to know which side
their senators stand on this issue. In
order to accomplish that goal, I very
much appreciated the statement the
majority leader Thun gave on the floor
of the Senate last November about the
need for more amendment votes in the
Senate. And here is what the majority
leader said on November 14th with
respect to the amendment process. Quote,
&#34;All members of the Senate and not just
the members of a particular committee
should have a voice in final legislation
through amendments on the floor. Members
should assume that amendment votes will
be the norm. That will mean tough votes
at times, but that is part of our jobs.&#34;
End of quote. And I would very much
agree with Majority Leader Thoon. The
truth is that in the past, whether it&#39;s
been Republican leaders or Democratic
leaders, no one debates that the
amendment process has been thwarted. And
I hope we will see a new opening here
where people will be allowed to offer
amendments, take tough votes. That&#39;s
what we were elected to do. Madam
President, on that note, I thank you and
I yield the floor.
