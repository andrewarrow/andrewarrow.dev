-He is way too cool.
I love that shirt.
By the way, that&#39;s the logo he
designed, his glasses and
his hat.
[ Cheers and applause ]
You know it&#39;s going to get
loud on the sidelines.
These Iowa ninjas are known
for their rowdy energy.
They&#39;ve really built a strong
ninja community there,
led by Jason&#39;s dad, Scott, who
runs the gym Ninja U.
Yeah, it&#39;s one of the premier
ninja gyms in Iowa.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-Big strides!
-With his size, he needs big
strides on Log Runner.
Right through it!
That felt so easy.
It didn&#39;t look strenuous at all.
-Well, apparently it wasn&#39;t,
because he&#39;s going right into
-Crank It Up!
-4&#39;11, 95 pounds,
And Akbar, you talk about
not carrying a lot of weight
through the course
but the kid&#39;s got a big heart.
-Oh it says it on the back
of his shirt.
I told him that back
on &#34;Ninja Junior&#34; --
you&#39;re small,
but you play big.
And that&#39;s always been
a part of his game.
And I&#39;m glad to see that
he&#39;s carrying it on to
the big course.
Well, I will say, sometimes
his moves hypnotize me.
[ Cheers and applause ]
And you see his brother Ben
there losing his mind.
-Well, let&#39;s see what
Biggie Smalls does here.
-You just can&#39;t help
but to root for him.
Oh! Look at him!
-Ooh, okay!
He&#39;s looking even stronger
than he did in qualifying
a few weeks ago.
-Uh-oh. That&#39;s a big drop.
-That&#39;s a big drop.
He&#39;s doing the 1-3-4 combo.
Got it.
Matt, He&#39;s not even huffing
and puffing.
It&#39;s like, &#34;Ha-ha-ha!&#34;
-And look at this!
[ Cheers and applause ]
His sister&#39;s already
on the verge of tears.
Biggie Smalls once again
at the Warped Wall.
15 years old, 95 pounds,
and no problem.
His sideline comes hustling
to keep up,
there&#39;s screaming
in the stands.
And they&#39;re going nuts
back in Iowa!
As you said,
you can&#39;t help but root for him.
How far can he go on
the back half?
-We love you, J, you got it!
-He should have no problem
on the Salmon Ladder.
This is easy.
He can do this one in his sleep.
Nice. Wow!
-All right, now on to Corkscrew.
-Go big! Go big!
-Big lache up.
-He knows how to take off.
-540 degrees of rotation.
-And here we go!
At 4&#39;11, Jason Behrends,
a big throw here on Corkscrew.
-All right, it&#39;s a big -- oh!
-And look at that hand
placement, Akbar!
Alright, now, Matt, he&#39;s got to
lache five feet across,
which is taller than him.
And then he&#39;s got to go
three feet up.
Oh! Yes! Yes!
And those hands were
perfectly at nine and three!
Jason Behrends!
-Oh, man!
-But at his size, the Dungeon&#39;s
gonna be a big ask.
-Let&#39;s go!
-C&#39;mon, Jason!
Let&#39;s get into it!
-I don&#39;t even know
if he weighs enough
to move this big board.
-If Jason Behrends is David,
the Dungeon is Goliath,
and we know how that story went.
All right, here we go.
Get all the way to the top
and dead weight it, right --
As you can see,
it&#39;s barely moving.
He&#39;s 95 pounds!
It&#39;s just not adding up.
-This bar,
it weighs more than him!
-Oh my goodness!
You see that?
-Oh, yes!
[ Cheers and applause ]
-Yes! Come on!
-Jason Behrends, what power!
-Oh, man!
-That was straight physics.
I&#39;m not even sure that
should be possible.
I don&#39;t know, he&#39;s
not even ready for physics yet.
He&#39;s only 15 years old.
I think he&#39;s got to take that
in senior year.
-Well, now he&#39;s got to transfer
to this next board.
-Throw yourself into it.
-Come on.
Come on!
-Rotating it.
This is it!
And that board weighs about
60 pounds.
Locks it in place.
Jason Behrends!
-Oh, boy.
-Man, look at this.
Tears on the sideline.
35ft away from being the
smallest, lightest athlete ever
to complete an
extended obstacle course.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Don&#39;t let anyone ever write
your story.
All night, Jason Behrends has
been in control of his story.
-Oh, my!
-If he hits this buzzer,
I don&#39;t care what anybody says.
At 4&#39;11, 95 pounds,
he is the big man on campus.
-Biggie Smalls turning in
another huge performance.
-Matt, it was all a dream.
And now he&#39;s about to do it.
It&#39;s about to become a reality.
-Oh, look at this!
Play big now.
Even his big papa
can&#39;t believe it.
Look at this!
That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about!
15 years of age,
Biggie Smalls is our
first finisher tonight!
