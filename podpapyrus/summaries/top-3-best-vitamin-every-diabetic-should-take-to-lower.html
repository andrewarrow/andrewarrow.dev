Doctors often advise reducing sugar in
meals or sticking to medications to
stabilize blood sugar. But there&#39;s an
important truth that&#39;s rarely mentioned.
The crucial role of essential nutrients
in managing diabetes. When the body
lacks vitamins and minerals, insulin
cannot function properly. Nerves become
weakened and dangerous complications may
appear faster than you expect. What&#39;s
concerning is that the majority of
people with diabetes are experiencing
these deficiencies without even
realizing it. Have you ever struggled
with constant fatigue, bodyaches, or
unstable blood sugar despite your best
efforts? The root cause may not only be
your diet or medication. It could be
that your body is missing a vital piece
of the puzzle. Correctly. Replenishing
these missing nutrients can make a
dramatic difference, helping you feel
stronger, sharper, and more in control
of your condition. In today&#39;s video,
we&#39;ll explore which nutrients are most
essential for people with diabetes and
how to ensure you get enough of them
every single day. Make sure to watch
until the very end because this
information may be the key to improving
your health and enhancing your quality
of life. Before we dive deeper, please
share with me where are you watching
this video from, leave a few words in
the comments so I know I&#39;m accompanying
you from all corners of the country. And
if you enjoy heartfelt and helpful
content like this, please don&#39;t forget
to like and subscribe to the channel so
you won&#39;t miss any of our upcoming
valuable videos. Number one, vitamin B6.
As we move into middle and older age,
most people focus on blood sugar or
blood pressure, but few pay attention to
vitamin B6. For those with diabetes or
at risk of complications, B6 acts like a
small gear in a large machine. Without
it, many systems fall out of sync. High
blood sugar pushes B6 out through the
kidneys faster, leaving you deficient,
even if your diet seems adequate.
inflammation, oxidative stress, and
common medications such as metformin
only increase this drain. The challenge
is that deficiency often hides in plain
sight. Some feel unexplained fatigue,
brain fog, or irritability. Others
develop tingling in the hands and feet.
Muscle weakness or balance problems
clear warnings from the nervous system
since B6 is essential for nerve
protection and repair. Skin and immunity
are also affected. Dry skin, mouth
sores, or frequent infections are red
flags. In severe cases, anemia may
develop causing dizziness, pale skin,
and shortness of breath. B6 also plays a
central role in hormonal balance. In
men, low levels can reduce testosterone
and sperm quality. In women, it may
disrupt cycles and worsen menopausal
symptoms. Think of B6 as a conductor for
dopamine and serotonin. Without it,
mood, energy, and even motivation may
collapse. Beyond hormones, B6 safeguards
organs vulnerable in diabetes. It
protects tiny blood vessels in the eyes,
slowing retinopathy. In the heart, low
B6 raises homocyine, a harmful amino
acid that stiffens vessels, raising the
risk of hypertension, heart attack, and
stroke for the kidneys. deficiency
weakens defenses against inflammation,
increasing diabetic complications. At
the cellular level, B6 is crucial for
glucose metabolism. It helps break down
glycogen to maintain steady energy,
reducing blood sugar swings, and
supporting insulin sensitivity. A
shortage worsens insulin resistance and
is often linked with anxiety,
depression, and insomnia since B6 is
vital for neurotransmitter production.
Finally, B6 is required for hemoglobin,
the protein that carries oxygen. Without
it, cells are starved, leaving you
exhausted, slowing wound healing and
weakening immunity. The safest way to
restore B6 is through food. Just one cup
of cooked chickpeas supplies over half
the daily need. Beef liver, wild caught
salmon, turkey, and sunflower seeds are
also excellent sources for older adults.
Replenishing B6 isn&#39;t only about meeting
vitamin requirements. It&#39;s about
protecting nerves, heart, eyes, and
immunity, the very pillars of health in
later life. If you enjoy refined meals,
you may be surprised that many gourmet
dishes are rich in vitamin B6. A serving
of grilled salmon with miso sauce and
half a cup of chickpeas provides over
90% of the daily requirement, plus
omega-3 fatty acids to support heart
health. Beef liver pate with garlic
potatoes. Just 100 grams of liver and
one medium potato delivers about 85% of
B6 along with iron and B12 to boost red
blood cell production. Mediterranean
lamb stew with chickpeas and saffron
supplies nearly 80% of the daily B6
requirement while strengthening muscles
and immunity. These examples show that
fine dining can also nurture long-term
health. Still diet alone may not provide
enough B6. In such cases, supplements
become important. The most bioactive
form is P5P purodoxal 5 phosphate which
the body uses directly. Trusted brands
like Thorn Research P5P 33 mg or pure
encapsulations 50 mgram are widely
respected for quality and absorption.
For people with diabetes, 2550 mg daily
is often sufficient. Though higher doses
should only be taken under medical
guidance, but supplementation is only
part of the picture. Certain habits can
quietly drain B6. Refined grains such as
white bread or pasta lose most of their
natural B6, while excess sugar increases
the body&#39;s demand for it. Alcohol
interferes with absorption and speeds up
B6 breakdown in the liver. Common
medications from birth control and
metformin to blood pressure drugs also
reduce B6 over time. Recognizing these
drains is as important as replenishing
the vitamin itself. B the sixth of may
not be the most eye-catching nutrient,
but for people with diabetes, it is a
true gamecher. If insulin is the key
that unlocks glucose into cells, B6 is
the steady hand that keeps that key from
rusting. It helps insulin work
efficiently, protects nerves, supports
the heart, maintains energy, and
stabilizes mood. With such wide-reaching
benefits, paying attention to B6 is not
just nutrition. It is a cornerstone of
healthy aging. If you find this sharing
helpful, kindly comment with the number
one below. That&#39;s a simple way for me to
know that you are still interested and
accompanying me on this journey toward
living healthier and improving your
quality of life each day. Number two,
vitamin A. Vitamin E works like an
invisible shield that protects your
cells, nerves, and blood vessels from
the daily damage of oxidative stress.
For people with diabetes, this shield is
consumed much faster. High blood sugar
produces more free radicals and
neutralizing them requires greater
amounts of vitamin E, making deficiency
a common problem. Because vitamin E is
fat soluble, it needs healthy fats for
proper absorption. Yet with age and
diabetes, fat metabolism often weakens,
making it harder to maintain stable
vitamin E levels even with a decent
diet. The danger is that deficiency
develops quietly. Early signs include
muscle weakness, poor coordination,
tingling or numbness in the hands and
feet, indicators of impaired nerve
signaling. For those with diabetic
neuropathy, low vitamin E only worsens
the condition. Other warning signs
should not be ignored. Dry or easily
irritated skin, wounds that heal slowly,
and vision problems such as night
blindness or eye strain may reflect
vitamin E deficiency since it protects
tiny blood vessels in the retina.
Frequent infections can also occur
because vitamin E is vital for immune
defense. The impact extends further. In
men, low vitamin E may reduce sperm
quality while in women, it can disrupt
hormone balance and menstrual health.
Sexual function can also decline since
vitamin E supports blood circulation.
From a neurological standpoint, lack of
this vitamin accelerates nerve damage,
already a major concern in diabetes. The
kidneys are equally vulnerable as
oxidative stress contributes to diabetic
kidney disease. Vitamin E also protects
the heart and circulation by keeping
arteries flexible, lowering inflammation
and preventing cholesterol oxidation. It
helps reduce the risk of atherosclerosis
and heart disease. At the cellular
level, it acts like armor for membranes,
ensuring proper signaling, nutrient
transport, and energy exchange. It also
improves insulin sensitivity, helping
glucose enter cells more effectively.
Another unique role of vitamin E is its
ability to recharge. Other antioxidants
like vitamin C, boosting overall defense
against oxidative damage. Without it,
cells age faster, inflammation rises,
and diabetic complications worsen. For
anyone managing diabetes, maintaining
optimal vitamin E levels is not just
about nutrition. It is a vital step in
protecting nerves, vision, heart health,
and long-term quality of life. The good
news is that you can boost vitamin E
naturally through food. Sunflower seeds
are the richest source. Just 1 ounce
provides about 66% of the daily need.
Almonds supply nearly 48%, hazelnuts
about 28% while cooked spinach gives 20%
per cup. Avocados are another excellent
option rich in both vitamin E and
healthy fats that improve absorption.
Enjoying meals that combine nutrition
and pleasure is also possible. A
Mediterranean dinner of grilled sea bass
with almonds provides over 70% of daily
vitamin E plus omega-3 for heart health.
Roasted duck with hazelnuts delivers
around 65% while an avocado tartar with
sunflower seeds supplies about 60%.
These dishes prove that healthy eating
can also bring joy. Still, diet alone
may not always be enough. In such cases,
supplements become useful. Natural
vitamin E, especially Dalphapherol,
is better absorbed than synthetic forms.
Trusted options include pure
encapsulations. vitamin E 400 IU and now
foods vitamin E which combines different
tocopherols for stronger antioxidant
support. For most people with diabetes,
a safe dosage ranges between 200 400 IU
daily, but it&#39;s important not to overdo
it. Excess vitamin E can thin the blood,
especially risky for older adults.
Certain habits and foods may also worsen
deficiency. Refined oils like corn and
soybean oil increase oxidative stress
and deplete vitamin E. Too much sugar
and refined starch fuels inflammation
while alcohol damages the liver&#39;s
ability to store vitamin E. A strict
low-fat diet also interferes with
absorption since this vitamin requires
healthy fats. Even cooking matters.
Overcooking vegetables destroys much of
their vitamin E. While light steaming or
eating fresh preserves it. Vitamin E is
more than just a vitamin. It is a silent
protector for people with diabetes. It
improves insulin efficiency, supports
the nervous system, protects blood
vessels, and reduces inflammation. If
your blood sugar is harder to control,
if nerve pain worsens, or if your skin
becomes dry and rough, these may be
signals of deficiency, replenishing
vitamin E can improve circulation,
strengthen immunity, and slow diabetic
complications. True health often comes
not from complicated solutions, but from
daily choices, nourishing the body with
wisdom and balance. To let me know
you&#39;re part of this caring community,
leave the number two in the comments
right now. Number three, vitamin C. When
it comes to nutrition, many people
immediately think of calcium for bones
or protein for muscles. But few realize
that vitamin C is the silent link that
determines overall health, especially
for those living with diabetes. The
truth is, your body uses vitamin C more
quickly than normal because high blood
sugar directly competes with vitamin C
along the same pathway into the cells.
When glucose floods the system, vitamin
C cannot enter properly, leading to a
silent deficiency. On top of that,
people with diabetes are constantly
under greater oxidative stress than
healthy individuals, which increases the
body&#39;s demand for vitamin C. Since this
is a water- soluble vitamin, frequent
urination, a common issue in diabetes,
causes it to be flushed out rapidly. As
a result, the body easily falls into
deficiency, often without you even
realizing it. What&#39;s important to note
is that this deficiency usually doesn&#39;t
show dramatic symptoms at first. You
might feel persistent fatigue without
knowing why, when, in fact, your cells
no longer have enough vitamin C to
produce energy. Slow healing bruises and
wounds are signs that collagen, the
biological glue that keeps skin, blood
vessels, and joints strong, isn&#39;t being
synthesized properly. Gums that bleed
easily, dry, rough skin, or recurring
colds and infections are all warning
bells that your body is lacking this
vital nutrient. Even joint pain and
stiffness can worsen due to insufficient
vitamin C, which normally acts like
protective armor for the cartilage. In
severe deficiencies, the consequences
become obvious. Iron deficiency anemia,
since vitamin C supports iron
absorption, can lead to pale skin,
weakness, dizziness, and lowered
immunity. But vitamin C&#39;s influence
doesn&#39;t stop there. It also affects
fertility and sexual health, areas many
older adults might not expect. In men,
vitamin C supports healthy sperm
motility. In women, it promotes
ovulation and helps stabilize hormone.
When vitamin C levels are low, both
fertility and sexual desire decline.
Because blood circulation, the critical
factor for sexual function becomes
impaired. The nervous system also
suffers. People with diabetes already
face a high risk of nerve damage. And
without vitamin C, this can worsen
leading to numbness, burning pain or
loss of sensation in the hands and feet.
The kidneys already burdened by high
blood sugar become more prone to
inflammation and decline without the
protective role of vitamin C. Even your
eyes depend on it to keep the tiny blood
vessels in the retina intact. When
vitamin C drops, vision loss
accelerates, raising the risk of
diabetic eye complications. Perhaps most
importantly, vitamin C safeguards the
heart and blood vessels. It is the key
to keeping artery walls soft and
flexible, reducing inflammation and
limiting plaque buildup. Without it,
blood vessels stiffen, blood pressure
rises, and the risk of heart attack or
stroke sores. Each cell in your body
also suffers damage without this
powerful antioxidant shield, speeding up
both aging and diabetes complications.
The good news is that replenishing
vitamin C through food is completely
achievable and simple. Some of the
richest sources include cockadoo plums
just 100 grams far exceeds daily needs
or acerola cherries which contain dozens
of times more vitamin C than oranges.
More accessible everyday options include
red bell peppers, kiwis, and
strawberries. Red bell peppers provide a
generous supply along with
anti-inflammatory compounds. Kiwis are
rich in fiber to help stabilize blood
sugar, and strawberries are both
delicious and immunity boosting. The key
is not just to get enough, but to supply
vitamin C consistently and steadily,
nourishing each cell and laying the
foundation for long-term health. And if
you are still watching up to this point,
I would like to invite you to leave the
number three in the comments. This will
let me know that you have received
valuable insights and found them
helpful. If you enjoy refined meals,
there are still plenty of options that
deliver lasting health benefits. Many
fruits and vitamin C rich dishes not
only provide a refreshing taste, but
also deeply nourish the body. A tropical
ceviche made with fresh fruits, salmon,
and colorful vegetables can supply
vitamin C levels far beyond the daily
requirement while also supporting the
immune system. Similarly, a tuna tartar
paired with kiwi and yuzu lemon offers a
refreshing tang with natural umami
delivering abundant vitamin C along with
beneficial bioactive compounds. Even a
dessert of acerola sorbet with dark
chocolate can satisfy a sweet craving
while still supporting cardiovascular
health. When we look at meals like
these, they are not only about culinary
enjoyment but also about caring for the
body through mindful daily choices. If
daily foods are not enough, you may also
consider dietary supplements. However,
the key point is that not all types are
absorbed effectively, recent studies
show that liposomal vitamin C can enter
the bloodstream more quickly and
efficiently compared to regular forms.
For example, a 1,000 mgram tube of
liposomaal vitamin C may support optimal
absorption. In addition, certain capsule
products containing pure ascorbic acid
also provide real benefits, especially
when taken at 500 to 1,000 mg per day.
During periods of stress, inflammation,
or illness, the body&#39;s need for vitamin
C may increase, and in such cases, a
higher dose can be particularly
effective. The most important thing is
to choose highquality products, avoid
overuse, and always combine
supplementation with a balanced diet.
There are also habits and types of foods
that can make it harder for your body to
maintain adequate vitamin C levels.
First, consuming too much sugar or
refined starches can block vitamin C
from entering cells, reducing its
antioxidant effects. Second, alcohol not
only damages the liver, but also
depletes vitamin C stores, stripping
away the body&#39;s natural defense. Third,
cooking vegetables at excessively high
temperatures can destroy much of their
vitamin C, whereas light steaming or
eating them fresh preserves more of
their value. And fourth, smoking is
among the most harmful factors as it
rapidly reduces vitamin C levels,
accelerating aging and cellular damage.
Taken together, these factors show that
maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not
just about eating well, but also about
avoiding habits that drain your
vitality. Vitamin C truly plays a vital
role in protecting the health of older
adults. It not only strengthens the
immune system, but also improves insulin
sensitivity, keeps blood vessels
flexible, and lowers the risk of
diabetes related complications. You can
think of vitamin C as a protective
shield against free radicals, helping
prevent neuropathy, safeguard kidney
function, and maintain clearer vision.
For those striving to manage blood sugar
and preserve quality of life, ensuring
adequate vitamin C intake, whether
through nutrient-rich fresh foods or
reliable supplements, is one of the most
practical and wise steps to safeguard
long-term Health.
