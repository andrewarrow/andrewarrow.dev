up the River Nile to a realm that&#39;s
existed since the dawn of time
Place ruled by pharaohs
Black Pharaohs
Egyptian art at the time depicted Nubian
nobility with darker skin than their own
bedazzled in large earrings and draped
in roads made of exotic animal skins
making them very distinct from the
average Egyptian the Nubia was a region
rich in Gold veins semi-precious stones
ebony wood incense and ivory this is a
forgotten African civilization which
like the Egyptians to the north built
temples and pyramids that would last 5
000 years
nuvia was known as cush for 2000 years
it was home to some of Africa&#39;s earliest
kingdoms and one of the earliest
civilizations of ancient Northeastern
Africa pie is the most well-known
kushite King who conquered Egypt and
became a pharaoh but other rulers have
also left a mark on History although the
early list of kush rulers is incomplete
from the currently excavated
archaeological findings there are plenty
of monarchs of the kushite Kingdom many
of which managed to become feared Rivals
of Egypt today we will talk about some
of the most renowned Nubian Kings the
kingdom of kush was located south of
Egypt along the Nile Valley the region
was known as the land of the bow because
of their skilled archers which were
often represented in the art of agent
Kush the civilization grew and developed
from around 2000 BCE to 350 CE during
this time many kings and queens ruled
over the land most of the inhabitants of
cush were farmers their main crops were
barley and wheat but they also grew
cotton to sew clothing other than
agriculture iron and gold Nubian Kings
relied on important trade items that
include incense slaves Ivory feathers
and wild animal hides early kushite
kings were buried on beds positioned on
Stone Platforms in the tombs below their
pyramids the pyramids of kush were often
smaller compared to those of Egypt many
of which were constructed close to the
city of Moreau before we can talk about
the Kings it is important to mention the
priests religion held a pivotal role in
the lives of the kushites kushite
priests held so much power that they
could decide when it was the right time
for the king to die women were also held
in high stature and could be leaders of
kush here we decided to list some of the
most influential figures that start with
the napatin period from around 700 to
300 BC let&#39;s begin King Alara Queen
kasaka date 795 to 752 BCE Alara is the
first known Prince of kush and the first
to unify all of upper Nubia in the third
cataract tomorrow he was the founder of
the napatin royal Dynasty and a highly
respected figure in the Nubian culture
at this time Egypt saw a general decline
in international Prestige and wealth
while Kush flourished for his long and
prosperous Reign Alara became a
legendary ruler to the people of kush
later on his daughter tabiri became the
wife of King PA number two king koshta
queen pabachma date 765 to 752 BCE
kashta was a successor and brother to
King Alara he greatly admired Egyptian
culture which is why he imported a lot
of artifacts from the north it was known
for egyptianizing the kingdom of kush
and Napata during the Nubian Invasion
around 747 BC experts estimate that
kashta conquered Upper Egypt known as
the land of reeds ancient Egyptians
believed that the field of reeds was a
paradise ruled over by Osiris the people
used reads to make a variety of items
such as baskets chairs boats sandals and
robes they were a raw material often
used by the common folk and considering
his love for Egyptian culture it made
sense that kinkoshna would Thrive to
take over this land his son PA would
later conquer the rest of Egypt and
continue to leave a mark in history
number three Pharaoh PA Queen tabiri
abar kinsa and pexator date
744-714 BCE King PA was probably the
greatest and most powerful Nubian
pharaoh who conquered Egypt and founded
the 25th Dynasty in the early days of
his rule PA mostly focused on Nubia he
had plenty of influence in the region
especially in teams that his sister
amenirdis the first was installed as
God&#39;s wife of Amun holding unprecedented
political power and spiritual
significance during his Reign rivalry
divided the rulers of Lower Egypt which
created the perfect opportunity for PA
to strike he was was Victorious at
heracopolis Conquering the cities of
Memphis hermopolis and others after his
remarkable Triumph PA sailed South and
went back to Nubia never to return to
Egypt PA claimed his campaign to be a
holy war and a time for his Warriors to
cleanse themselves before battle all in
the name of the greater God Amun he
reigned for more than 30 years number
four Pharaoh shabitku Queen walhara
mesbot and taba kanamu date
714-705 BCE during shibitku&#39;s Reign at
first there was a policy of conciliation
with Assyria backed by Sargon II the
king of the neo-assyrian Empire after
Sargon II&#39;s death shibitku seems to have
used a different policy he actively
resisted any new Syrian expansion into
Canaan under the new ruler sinacharib
shibitku sent his brothers to venture
from Nubia to the north of teams the
Nubian Army was set to clash with the
Assyrians in 701 BC at the Battle of el
Teche another Stella to be depict
records of Assyrians attacking Jerusalem
and shabiku marching against them
chibitku was also known for finishing
the decoration of the Temple of Osiris
heckjet which proves to be a notable
feat for their culture and religion
number five Pharaoh Shabaka Queen Artie
shabaka&#39;s Reign holds a lot of
importance because it saw a huge amount
of construction work throughout Egypt
particularly in teams Chewbacca
appointed teams as the capital of his
kingdom while he ruled he strengthened
the Nubian Kingdom&#39;s control over all of
Egypt he also built a pink Granite
statue of himself in Karnak some of the
most popular relics of his Reign are the
Chewbacca Stone which records multiple
documents of the Old Kingdom another
relic of great importance is the Shabaka
gate this is a big stone door that is
estimated to guard the room where the
king stored all of his treasures if

to 664 BCE both a king of kush and the
pharaoh of Egypt to harka managed to
expand trade into Levant Levant was the
crossroad of many peoples and cultures

taharka also organized massive
construction projects across Egypt but
the peace came to an end when a Syrian
King Essa Hardon declared war on Egypt
in 677 BCE and invaded the territory
after four years of conflict taharka and
his khrushrite Egyptian Army emerged
Victorious he then sacked Memphis and
successfully invaded Upper Egypt in
Upper Egypt taharka tried to reverse

put an end to the rule of the 25th
Dynasty over Egypt
number seven Pharaoh tantamani Queen
Pian karti Malachi and salka date
664-653 BCE

throne which is why he invaded Egypt his
actions reignited another conflict Asher
bani Paul led the Assyrians into battle
and together with the Carrie and
mercenaries and Psalm took the first
Army they clashed near the Temple of
Isis in North Memphis the Assyrians
defeated tantamani forcing him to flee
to Upper Egypt as a result teebs was
severely plundered and badly broken this
is known as the sack of teams an example
of horror and destruction that can
happen to a major city this was a
momentous event that reverberated across
history the Assyrians took a huge amount
of gold clothes horses and other prized
materials they also carry two obelisks
to Assyria which weighed about 75.5 tons
even though Upper Egypt still
acknowledged tantamani&#39;s Authority
during his eighth year rule the
Assyrians ended Nubian control over
Egypt after being weakened teams

King at lanersa Queen Collis said
malateral yaturo peltison taba date
653-640 BCE unlike the reign of his
predecessors Attila nurses kingdom was
confined to the region of kush

their defeat the kushites held a
prominent influence in the tibin region
atlanersa was also the second Nubian
King to construct a pyramid in Nuri
after taharka number nine Cinco manuskin
queen nasalsa and the manamalo date 640
to 620 BCE silica monoskin put all his
efforts into morale during this time

the kushite Kingdom his goal was most
likely to stabilize the domain starting
with the economy and political power

for his official coronation on lamani

the national Temple of the Moon as
Systrom players in ancient Egypt it was
believed that the Systrom had a mystical
power Systrom players would use this
instrument during rituals to honor Isis
bastet and hathor the kingdom of kush
was known for its large-scale trade
routes that provided luxury goods famous
Nubian Kings managed to conquer Egypt
during the 25th Dynasty which gave them
an active influence over Northern
African culture the Kush were very
similar to the ancient Egyptians in many
aspects including region culture that&#39;s
because the Kush rulers admired Egyptian
culture and religion like the Egyptians
the cushites build pyramids mummified
their dead and worshiped Egyptian
deities outside of the ruling class the
Kush priests hold significant power they
would communicate with the gods and make
laws in 656 BC the kushite Kingdom of
Egypt came to an an end yet the cushite
Kings continued to rule Nubia were just
scratching the surface of our history
