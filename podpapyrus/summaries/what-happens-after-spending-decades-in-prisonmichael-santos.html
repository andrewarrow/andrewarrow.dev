my name is Michael Santos I&#39;m the
founder of prison professors and I
started that really nonprofit because I
was in prison serving a 45-year prison
term although I live in Southern
California right now the reality is I
started in in a background that probably
should have never led me to prison I
grew up in North Seattle a community
called Lake Forest Park on the North End
of Lake Washington had every opportunity
to lead a normal life but when I was
about 20 years old I saw the movie
Scarface and it put me in on a bad path
my father had escaped from Cuba and
actually I still remember driving down
the road and hearing that story um of
Tony Montana talking on the radio I said
that dude sounds like a Cuban uh sounded
like my father so I wanted to go see the
movie really not knowing what it was
about I wasn&#39;t a drug user but I was so
enthralled by the movie hot chicks fast
cars um super fun life and I thought
that sounds like something I want to do
but I didn&#39;t know anything I I didn&#39;t
use drugs but I knew people who used
cocaine so I started reaching out to to
people I knew who used cocaine and I&#39;d
say well if you use cocaine isn&#39;t it
logical that you bought cocaine from
somebody and they said sure I said well
do me a favor find out what it costs and
I mean this is all the wisdom of a
20-year-old that&#39;s how old I was back in
1984 885 when this began and I learned
the price of a kilogram back then in
North Seattle was is I recall it
somewhere in the $50,000 range so I made
a phone call to some of the guys the the
children of other people that my father
escaped Cuba from well his name was Tony
in Miami and I said Tony you live in
Miami you went to high school in Miami
you must know somebody who who sells
cocaine he said sure I said find out how
much does a kilogram of cocaine cost and
he comes back to me and he says it&#39;s
$220,000 and you know just do some
simple math and I said I could buy it
$220,000 um people are paying up here in
Seattle north of
$50,000 There&#39;s an opportunity here um
but of course I didn&#39;t want to do it
myself because I I I knew it was against
the law this is really Before the War on
Drugs Ronald Reagan is in the white
house to give you some context of time
and um I started asking some of my
friends I said well you know if I pay
you five grand would you fly to fly to
Miami drive home with your girl and and
traffic this cocaine with you bring it
back to North Seattle and I found people
who would do it so that&#39;s how I kind of
got started but I also needed the money
so I told my father a lie uh that I was
going to help fund his or help him with
his construction business buying
construction equipment that was from a
company that was going out of business I
said I need to take some cash because I
want to make a cash offer my whole
mindset was I could take this money from
my father buy the cocaine in Miami bring
it back to Seattle have it sold put the
money back in my dad&#39;s account and and
and all be well I mean if you&#39;re were
going to make $30,000 a kilo that was
the goal I didn&#39;t realize that what I
was really doing was making myself into
a much more serious crime than if I were
doing it myself I was putting myself in
the role of a Kingpin so that lasted
that transaction worked out well I made
a few $100,000 as a 20-year-old which
was all the money in the world and put
the money back in my dad&#39;s account
and then really just scaled from there
and continued doing that from the time I
was 20 until the time I was 22 or so
people started to get arrested um they
started to cooperate against me I went
to uh hired an attorney he told me he
said yeah there&#39;s an investigation going
that&#39;s on but you&#39;re not yet a Target
but I didn&#39;t want to stick around to be
a Target so I moved to the south of
Spain in a community called Marb and I
started making my life there for several
months but you know when you&#39;re living
in Marb you you you kind of miss the
United States I didn&#39;t even speak
Spanish so it was hard for me to
assimilate there so I called the
attorney and I said is there is there
has there been anything going on on this
case of mine the attorney says um no I
haven&#39;t heard anything so I decide to
come back to the United States in August
of 1987 after being gone for several
months and it wasn&#39;t long thereafter
that de agents came and pointed the gun
at my face and said you know you&#39;re are
you Michael Santos I said I am he said
you&#39;re under arrest and uh that was the
first like wakeup call that I&#39;ve created
a very big problem for myself they told
me I was facing life in prison um I
didn&#39;t understand what that meant all I
knew is that I didn&#39;t get caught with
any cocaine I didn&#39;t get caught with
there were no telephone calls with me on
there um they didn&#39;t find any money
around me I did I was living a lifestyle
that I couldn&#39;t explain um but I really
wanted to believe that I could get out
of this and I had an attorney who was
telling me what I wanted to hear rather
than what I needed to hear what I needed
to hear was you&#39;ve made some really bad
decisions in your life and you&#39;re facing
a serious crime uh a a serious sentence
um and you should accept responsibility
and and try and make amends but I I
wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t getting that guidance
from my attorney and I and and and so he
was telling me what I wanted to hear and
I decided great then let&#39;s go to trial
but I was l locked in that first year I
they never let me out on bail after that
arrest so I&#39;m locked in solitary
confinement and I&#39;d never been in
custody before so you know I was 23
years old I didn&#39;t understand I didn&#39;t
get an opportunity to talk with other
people in jail because I&#39;m in the I&#39;m in
the hole and and you know this is what I
thought prison was going to be like and
my lawyer just keeps telling me there&#39;s
a big difference between an indictment
and a conviction but you know anybody
who&#39;s experienced the federal system
would later learn there&#39;s not a big
difference between an indictment and a
conviction when you get charged with a
crime in the federal system you are
genuinely um you know good chance you&#39;re
going to face a sentencing hearing but I
didn&#39;t understand that and I really
wanted to believe that I would walk out
of here well it didn&#39;t turn out that way
after about five or six months I went to
trial several people with whom I was
pretty close testified against me and
said that I would had put this scheme
together to traffic and cocaine where I
would hire people that would fly down to
Miami drive it across country distribute
it to people store it so I was really in
my mindset that if I didn&#39;t do anything
I I if I didn&#39;t touch it myself I wasn&#39;t
breaking the law but the crime that I
was convicted of and charged with was
called a 848 A continuing criminal
Enterprise uh and it carried a possible
sentence of life in prison so while
going through a trial that lasted about
a month where scores of people testified
against me I just dug myself deeper I
mean I took the witness stand and said I
Didn&#39;t Do It um I the jury saw through
it all and convicted me of every count
and it was that moment that really my
life began to change because when the
marshals locked me in cuffs this time I
knew I wasn&#39;t getting out of prison and
I went back to the jail and I&#39;m into
solitary confinement and there was an
officer that I wish I could thank
because he really is the one that
changed my life he he known me for
several months while I was in the cell
and he came to me and I and I remember
him leaning against the window and just
said how did it go and I said it really
didn&#39;t go very well I was convicted of
every count and now I&#39;m facing life in
prison and he said to me I&#39;ve got
something that I think can help you and
I said you know what&#39;s that he said I&#39;m
going to bring you a book and it&#39;s
amazing how a book can change your life
and this was a book about Frederick
Douglas I didn&#39;t know who Frederick
Douglas was but he was a guy was born
during the era of slavery and
he uh you know didn&#39;t know any life
other than than being a slave and he
lived in that way for 20 years until he
escaped and this is this message that I
got out of that book is that when
Frederick Douglas escaped he didn&#39;t go
on to lead his own life and and be free
instead he wanted to try and change the
world and he he to do that he had to
learn how to read he had to learn how to
write and he had to learn how to
communicate really well and that is
really what led him to becoming one of
the most influential abolitionist has
led to the abolition of slavery so I I
remember getting inspired by that and
then officer his name was officer Wilson
that&#39;s all I know of him uh brought me
another book and it was Plato&#39;s Republic
and you know I had been a terrible
student in school but when you&#39;re in the
hole for a long period of time that&#39;s
your only form of communication your
only form of connection to the world and
I&#39;m reading this Plato&#39;s Republic and it
started off with this story called The
creto of Socrates being in jail and he&#39;s
facing death uh for the crime of wanting
to teach other people and you know I
thought that that was a a noble thing
that Socrates really believed that every
person had the right to try and become
better it was just in his Society was
against the law from people from one
class to teach another so he broke the
law he went to trial he was convicted
and he was facing death but it but but
but the leaders didn&#39;t really want to
carry it through and his buddy his name
was crto came to see Socrates in jail
and he said to him I am um don&#39;t worry
about it we&#39;re going to let you you know
I&#39;ve already worked it out with a Jailer
your friends are going to support you in
Exile you&#39;re going to walk out of here
tonight and you can go on to live your
life in peace and Socrates said no I&#39;m
going to stay and his friend CTO said
what do you mean you&#39;re going to stay if
you stay you&#39;re going to die and
Socrates said yes I&#39;m going to die and
he said why would you do that and he
said well I live in a democracy and a
democracy I&#39;ve got to take the good with
the bad and this is a bad law but I
would I I broke the law and I would
rather die with my dignity intact than
run away like a coward for problems that
I created this Society has clothed me
and fed me and protected me from foreign
enemies and I have the right to change
laws I don&#39;t agree with I don&#39;t have the
right to break laws and I&#39;ll just say it
was the combination of Frederick Douglas
and Socrates that changed my life I
remember putting the book on my chest
and lineing back in that cell and just
kind of staring as you&#39;re feeling the
pressure of the walls and the ceiling
closing in I haven&#39;t been sentenced yet
I&#39;m facing life in prison and thinking
to myself is there some kind of way that
I could make sense out of whatever is
going to come and what was going to come
was a sentence that it would be no less
Le than 10 years and possibly life and I
thought yeah there there probably is
people who are familiar with Socrates
may be familiar with this concept of
Socratic questioning and asking
questions and while I was sitting in
that cell thinking about what was coming
I started to think about well people I
would imagine like your viewers who are
just law-abiding citizens uh people who
don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to go to
prison I said is there anything that I
could do while I&#39;m in here anything
would cause the world to see me not as a
Coke trafficker but rather how do I
respond to this and how do I make amends
and reconcile with society and I said
the answer is probably yes there is
probably something that we could do but
what is it and I didn&#39;t know the answer
to that because the the the staff in in
a jail setting is basically telling you
if you can&#39;t do the crime don&#39;t do if
you can&#39;t do the time don&#39;t do the crime
and I didn&#39;t understand what it would be
like but I but I wasn&#39;t thinking so much
about my immediate environment I was
thinking about the world to which I
wanted to return and and I thought well
what would the people that are going to
have influence on my life expect from me
and and I came across with this like
three-pronged approach that was going to
guide me through prison and one I think
the people I&#39;m going to meet that might
have influence over my life they would
want me to show I don&#39;t want to be a
criminal anymore and one way I could do
that would be to get an education and
that became super important to me I said
I&#39;m going to find a way to get an educ a
while I&#39;m in custody and the second
would be to uh find a way to contribute
to society and some kind of meaningful
measurable way and and the third would
be I would have to build a support
system a group of people that would
believe in me and if I could do that I
hoped that my journey through prison
whatever length of time it was going to
be would help me would would would give
me a chance to come back to society
strong with my dignity intact and
opportunities to to build a life even
though I&#39;m going to be in prison for all
of my 20s all of my 30s all of my 40s I
didn&#39;t even know how long it was at that
time I just knew I was going to be in
prison for a long time and I got so
inspired and know this was inspired by
the story of Frederick Douglas and
Socrates I can&#39;t say I did it myself I
was really inspired by those people and
so I remember getting up and you know
you&#39;re in a solitary cell and I&#39;m
sitting on this little concrete bunk and
I write a letter to the newspaper who&#39;d
been covering my trial and saying I made
a lot of bad decisions I went to trial I
denied what I had done the government
had been press pressuring me to
cooperate against others but I wasn&#39;t on
that path I was just you know already
convicted there was no getting out of
jail at this point but I said maybe I
could do something to make better maybe
I could draw a line in the sand and that
and I told the journalists if you want
to know the story of what happened you
know come and see me and that led to a
journalist coming to visit me and I told
them that I had deep regrets for the
decisions that I had made and I was
going to find a way to to emulate the
the adjustment of Frederick Douglas or
what I learned from Socrates and when I
got to prison this is what I was going
to do is to find a way to make it better
and uh you know when somebody hears that
kind of story I think that there&#39;s
always it starts with a level of
cynicism that that that something can
happen and I accepted that and that&#39;s
certainly what happened when I went to
sentencing because a few months later
they I I went to the sentencing hearing
and I&#39;ll always remember the judge
reading that article because it came out
top of the fold in the newspaper and the
judge read it before I was sentenced
before I imposed sentence and the
prosecutor got up and I&#39;ll always
remember what he said that he said
Michael Santos says he&#39;s going to change
his life while he&#39;s in custody but you
know the United States feels that if he
spends every day of his life in an allc
consuming effort to repay Society or to
reconcile with Society we believe that
even if he lives to be three 300 years
old our society will be at a significant
net loss and you know that it was kind
of harsh to hear that at the time but it
was also it was also the world in which
I lived you know you you go into the
criminal justice system and it is
designed to obliterate hope and to tell
you that you&#39;ve got nothing coming at
all and I I I felt that that was helpful
to me to get that kind of news because
it it prepared me for really what was
coming and the marshals you know locked
me in handcuffs and shackles and uh led
me through the the system that takes you
into the Federal Bureau of Prisons and I
was convicted in Seattle but they
transferred me to a high security
penitentiary in Atlanta and at that time
you know the prison system was much
smaller there were only about 30,000
people in prison in the mid1
1980s but this was the era of the war on
drugs and things were changing and uh
you know you had Nancy Reagan make
statements on television about just say
no and Ronald Reagan saying that drugs
were one of the biggest problems in
society and the only way to respond to
it was through lengthy sentences so I I
got my judge sentenced me to 45 years in
federal prison with no parole but
because I had been in the hole for the
first year I didn&#39;t even really know
what that meant I didn&#39;t know am I going
to be in prison for 45 years and that
was kind of hard to conceive because I
hadn&#39;t been alive that long but when I
got to the penitentiary you know it was
very different I went it was the most
violent federal prison in the nation at
the time and you know there was a lot of
tension there but when I got there it
was to me an amazing piece of Liberty
because I&#39;d been in the hole for a year
and there was a 40-foot wall that went
around the prison so I could I could see
you know horizontally but you can&#39;t see
over the wall so so so so it&#39;s it is
somewhat confining the one thing that I
could see is up and I could see the blue
sky and I could breathe fresh air not in
a metaphorical sense but in a literal
sense because when you&#39;re in the hole
You you don&#39;t have fresh air so
breathing fresh air and seeing the Blue
Sky really gave me hope and that&#39;s what
I I I think is so important for people
who are living in a crisis is to believe
and to see you can become something more
I&#39;d love to say that was those are my
own words but that&#39;s what I learned from
these people I read about and I
continued reading about people who had
gone through struggle and challenges and
it helped me realize there&#39;s going to be
a way through this but it&#39;s not going to
be by accident and and it&#39;s not going to
be by happy talk and talking about what
somebody else is going to do for me it&#39;s
going to be something what can I
do and because I&#39;d never been
incarcerated before I didn&#39;t even know
how the system was organized I went to a
high security penitentiary I just
thought that&#39;s what was prison was like
but you start hearing these messages
about how to serve time and dur that&#39;s
real was really important important
during that first 30 days of of time in
prison before I went to a uh what&#39;s
called a team meeting and you meet with
staff and I&#39;m hearing from guys in
prison who are telling me you know the
the way to survive in here is to have a
real ball of hate in your stomach and a
knife and sure that&#39;s the way to survive
if you want to live in prison and if you
want this kind of life but by then I&#39;d
been incarcerated for a year and I hated
every second of it I&#39;d lost everything
um that I had previously taken for
granted and I knew I wanted to get out
and some point get out and build a life
a life that would lead to something
better uh and and so I it was through
that process that I started to hear
about the prison system is divided
there&#39;s high security penitentiaries and
medium Securities and low Securities and
minimum Securities and and I&#39;d heard
this from the other guys I was serving
time with so finally I go to the this
team meeting where I&#39;m meeting with a
case manager and a counselor and a unit
and and I I I&#39;ve got my plan of how I&#39;m
going to get through this and I remember
asking them you know I&#39;ve heard about
these things called federal correctional
institutions and lower security prisons
I said is there any chance of me being
able to transfer to one of those prisons
and I and I&#39;ll always remember the unit
manager telling me said you&#39;ve been
convicted of an 848 you&#39;re a drug
kingpin and you are s a federal judge
sentenced due to 45 years he said this
is exactly where you were supposed to be
and you&#39;ll be in this environment until
you get out and um you know I didn&#39;t
really understand what that meant but I
understood that I I I&#39;m in an
environment where I&#39;m going to be for a
long time and I didn&#39;t know how to
process it I&#39;d heard by then about good
time and I could finish the sentence in
26 years because I was convicted under a
law that the the sentencing laws have
changed since then since
1987 now the there&#39;s less good time but
at that time be if you avoided
disciplinary infractions you would get
credit what&#39;s called good behavior and I
learned I could set satisfy the sentence
in 26 years so I I didn&#39;t even know what
that meant because I wasn&#39;t I hadn&#39;t
lived for 26 years and you know to kind
put that perspective we&#39;re we&#39;re filming
this in in 25 26 years you&#39;re looking at
2051 2052 how do you stay strong while
you&#39;re going through that period of time
and you know I didn&#39;t know the answer to
that but I did have that plan that I got
from Socrates and that&#39;s don&#39;t think
about where I am right now think about
how I want to get out of here and just
as I did in the solitary Sal take a
pencil and start writing letters I start
writing letters to universities because
that was the first plan I&#39;ve got to
demonstrate I don&#39;t want to be a
criminal and it&#39;s kind of hard to do in
a high security penitentiary where
there&#39;s a tremendous amount of pressure
all the time but if you&#39;ve got a plan
you you you can you can architect the
strategy so my plan was to first of all
I&#39;ve got to focus on getting an
education I really wanted to penetrate
those 40 foot walls but the only way I
could get on to the other side would be
if I could learn how to put words into
sentences and sentences into paragraphs
and connect with people and I didn&#39;t
know how to do that because I&#39;d been
such a a terrible student in high school
so I start writing to universities you
know and and basically you know my name
is Michael Santos I&#39;m in prison I made
really bad decisions but I really want
to be better is there any chance of
going to school and you send one letter
out you know you&#39;re probably not going
to get a response you send 10 letters
out you know I always say you got a 10
times better chance of not getting a
response but if you could send out a
hundred letters if you could really try
to connect with the world somebody&#39;s
going to respond and I I was very
fortunate when I connected with a
university that said okay we want you to
give you a chance and I got enrolled in
school and they sent me books and I
remember when I got those books within
the first couple of months of getting to
the pen all of a sudden I didn&#39;t feel as
if I was a prisoner anymore now I was a
student and I was building my path and
pursued that path of working toward an
undergraduate degree and and as I got
closer to getting that degree I wanted
to go to law school and I started
writing to law schools and and and and
say making that same statement I&#39;ve been
in prison for a long time I&#39;m I&#39;m about
to get my undergraduate degree and I
want to continue with my education it
was always a pathway that I believed
would help me put put me on the pathway
to New Opportunities so the law schools
all wrote me back and said you know the
American Bar Association will not allow
us to Grant a degree to somebody who&#39;s
not on campus and studying on campus but
maybe one of them hofra Law School in
New York wrote me back and said well you
can&#39;t get to law school but maybe um we
could do some we have more flexibility
with a graduate degree what would you
want to study and and my whole message
was you I really think this concept of
mass incarceration is one of the great
social injustices of our time and it
really afflicts you know poor people and
people of color more than anyone else
and I want to have a role in trying to
change that and uh they were were
receptive to that message and allowed me
to start working toward a a master&#39;s
degree and I studied the prison system
and the people that holds so I was
really kind of like um kind of like you
mark in the sense that you get a be an
ethnographer and tell people&#39;s stories
in their own words and so I started to
interview other people in prison and
write their stories and then use them to
teach in universities so I&#39;d start
sending them out to professors and I&#39;d
built this you might remember that
earlier I said Fred Douglas kind of or
Socrates inspired me to come up with
this plan of getting an education
contributing to society and building a
support network well that that&#39;s kind of
hard to get off the ground but once you
get started you find it starts getting
momentum and and uh it start once I got
into college and I&#39;d read about somebody
who was doing something I&#39;d write them a
letter and introduce myself and some of
them would invite me to contribute to
their work they were interested oh I&#39;d
like to hear about prison and and that&#39;s
who I would write to academics and
professors who wrote about the prison
system and that pathway really started
to help me build my network so the three
things really worked together where
getting an education made it easier for
me to connect with professors which made
it easier for me to build a support
network and I&#39;d start writing the
stories of the people around me and
telling the story how did you get
involved in crime what motivated you
what have you learned from this
experience and it started sending out
and they invited these professors
invited me to publish chapters in their
books and then start writing for
peer-reviewed journals and then some of
my mentors they would come to visit me
in prison and these were some of the
leading penologists in the world uh and
they would come to visit me in prison
and and and and work with me and allow
me to to write for them while I still
had decades to serve in
prison but that process really helped me
build momentum and it and it gave me
hope and it made me believe that I&#39;m I&#39;m
executing this plan of preparing myself
for what I want to do when I get out so
so I um I got a a great opportunity to
publish with with people that were some
of the leading textbook authors who
introduced me to their Publishers by the
time I was in my I would say 10th year
imprisonment uh I I got invited to work
closely with a guy by the name of
Professor George Cole who is the dean at
the University of Connecticut and and
wrote one of the leading textbooks on
criminal justice and he suggested to me
why don&#39;t you write a book that would be
similar that would talk about your
experience that we could use where my
book is Theory you could write about
what could we do better in the prison
system and that led to the first book
that I wrote called about prison uh and
about prison was used was published by
Wadsworth and was used in universities
across the country and then I reached
out to another Mentor who is Dr Marilyn
mcshain um who is also an author but on
the editorial board of some academic
Publishers and she invited me to write a
book and I said well I I&#39;d like to tell
the story of people in prison so I took
those shorter pieces and turned it into
a longer book that was called profiles
from prison and it told the story of
people who were serving es of different
length from 5 years to 10 years to 20
years to more than 20 years and I really
wanted the world to know what are they
going through and what could we learn
from them and most importantly what
could we do to improve the prison system
so more people come out successfully
well that strategy um really was laying
the groundwork for for what I would do
in going through prison because it
helped me build a broader support
network and people that would be vested
in kind of working with me and uh I I&#39;ll
always remember one of the biggest
influences it had on my life was around
200 and uh one I think it was 2001 or
2002 when some student who in some
University I don&#39;t even know who it
was was doing some research on me and
you know that was that by then the
internet had started and it was easier
for people to research and he&#39;d read
about me in one of these books and he
was researching me and he found out that
I&#39;d graduated from short Chris High
School in North Seattle in 1982 so in
2001 they were getting ready to do the
20-year reunion for the class of
1982 and the woman that was coordinating
it all her name was Carol uh this guy
just wrote an unsolicited letter said is
this the same short Crest where Michael
Santos went and Carol um wrote him back
and said yes you know why are you asking
and he said oh well he&#39;s in prison and
he&#39;s serving a long sentence and I read
about him in this book
and that prompted Carol to write me a
letter and the letter was you know a
nasty letter I would say but not the
nasty kind of letter a guy in prison
wants to get it was it was rather you
know just you know I&#39;m a mother of two
kids drugs are bad I I always knew you
were a bad kid I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re in
prison now and she said but we are
having a 20-year reunion and you know
I&#39;ll send you some images or something
and I remember taking that letter and
and showing it to my friends in the
prison and said she see seems very angry
with me but I said I&#39;ll bet you I can
make her my girlfriend and that was
always a challenge to do something that
the prison said you couldn&#39;t do it so I
started writing her a letter and said
yes I made a lot of really bad decisions
when I was a kid and and and I regret
that now but you know I&#39;m not 20 anymore
I&#39;m 35 or however old I was and and I&#39;ve
done this I&#39;m really trying to make a
difference that led to a correspondence
and the correspondence led to a
friendship and the friendship eventually
after several months about 10 months she
came to visit me and prison and we fell
in love inside of a federal prison&#39;s
visiting room and one of the greatest
joys of my life is that on uh June 24th
2003 she married me inside of a federal
prison when I still had about 10 years
to go and you know when a woman comes
into a guy&#39;s life in prison the first
thing is I&#39;m GNA help get you out and
I&#39;d say I&#39;m not getting out of prison
you know this is uh there&#39;s a war on
drugs and it&#39;s a bad system and I&#39;ve
been working really hard to change that
system a position myself to build a
career around that Journey because we
incarcerate more people than any other
Nation on the planet and it&#39;s a bad
system and and my career is going to be
about changing that system but I&#39;m not
getting out that this won&#39;t happen
George Bush uh to was in the White House
at that time and there was still very a
lot of emphasis on the war on drugs and
uh but let&#39;s build a life together and
so we did and and I had built this
career in in prison that was was was
really uh fortunate you know I I i&#39;
started in high security
penitentiaries I never had a single
altercation even though I was there for
eight years I went to a medium security
prison continue to executing the plan
that I&#39;d put in place I met Carol when I
was in a low security prison and you
know we started
developing a kind of unconventional
family where she moved I was in New
Jersey she moved to New Jersey so that
we could visit every day and it was
always this idea I told her I said I&#39;m
going to find a way to work to change
the system but I still had 10 years to
go fortunately I had built income
streams even while I was in prison from
that publishing and it was it allowed
her me to support Carol while we were in
prison and she decided to go back to
school so that she could become a nurse
and but the idea was always on the other
side of this I want to build a
meaningful career and I want you we&#39;re
going to work together but at the
beginning she was like my liais on to
the world so I would continuously write
and the world was changing the internet
had begun so she helped me build a web
page and I&#39;d start publishing even more
than these earlier books and uh I
remember after she had relocated to New
Jersey we&#39;re in the visit one time and
and I heard the guard say Santos you
know come up and I you know typically
when that happens it&#39;s because you know
you&#39;re you&#39;re getting a little too close
or a little too affectionate with your
visitor but I I was experienced in foris
I knew that sstem I didn&#39;t touch her so
I go up to the to to the to the officer
you know and he said Lieutenant wants to
see you and I said you know there&#39;s
never a good reason to be called the
Lieutenant&#39;s office in
prison so I go see the lieutenant and I
kind of know who he is his name was
Nesbit and Nesbit says do you know why
you&#39;re here that&#39;s always the first
question they ask in prison and I said
yes I know why I&#39;m here and he and he
said you know what the kind of surprise
why are you here I said 20 years ago or
so I sold cocaine and ever since then
I&#39;ve been going through this nonsense
and and and he laughed because I I had a
relationship with him and he said to me
he said no um he said uh you&#39;re you&#39;re
I&#39;m sending you to a camp you&#39;re going
to a camp and to put perspective when
you start in a high security
penitentiary a camp is like being home
minimum security and and I couldn&#39;t
believe that I was going to a camp I
remember when they first met with me
they told me you&#39;ll never get out of a
pen of a high security pen but I&#39;d gone
after seven or eight years went to a
medium spent a few years there after
eight years in a low now I&#39;m going to a
camp and and Camp means there&#39;s really
you&#39;re there on the honor System there&#39;s
not even a fence around
it and so I go to the camp and now I&#39;ve
got whole new stage of preparation to do
because this is now getting 10 years to
somebody that&#39;s just going into the
prison that may seem like a long time
but for me I&#39;d already had 16 years of
prison behind me and 10 years didn&#39;t
seem that long so Carol who had just
moved to New Jersey is now having to
move around and so she&#39;d moved from New
Jersey to where my first Camp was in
Colorado and I get to Colorado and now I
want to I but I I&#39;m in a different stage
I&#39;ve already written books for the
universities now I want to write a book
for mainstream America and I wrote a
book called called I I I wanted to
figure out how am I going to do that
because I I I viewed all of this as part
of advocacy I had to build credibility
and P being a published author I
believed would build credibility so
since I published two books about prison
and profiles from prison for an academic
audience I thought I would be ready to
write for the mainstream so I I learned
that I had to get an agent so I started
writing letters to agents in the same
way that I wrote letters to schools and
told them my story I wrote a couple s
sample chapters I wanted to write a book
that was equivalent to a book that
inspired me by Alexander saniton called
um the gulag archipelago which would
tell the story of the entire prison
American prison system but it&#39;s huge
book it&#39;s like an Old Testament size
book it&#39;s a thousand Pages or 1500 pages
and the agents wrote me back and said
you know nobody&#39;s going to read that
much about prison you need to slim it
down and so um I agreed and I I wrote a
samp LE chapter and fortunately a agent
got me a deal with St Martin&#39;s press in
2004 I think it was or 2005 for a book
that was called inside life behind bars
in America and it was a really portrayal
that I would say is 85% about what I saw
and experienced and maybe 15% about my
own journey and it was reviewed in the
LA Times book review and the New York
Times book review so it got a lot of
media and as a result I would get
transferred to other prisons so first i&#39;
go to the solitary confinement again
because you&#39;re not supposed to be
publishing from prison and I remember
getting transferred from there to Lao
from Colorado in to Lao in here in
California and it had been 17 years it
took me before I got to lpo so I was on
the East Coast the first 17 years of my
sentence before I could come back to the
West Coast which is which was home for
me so I was very happy to come to Lomo
but I remember being in the hole and a
captain there the captain as the head of
security came to see me said we know
that you&#39;re an author or that you&#39;ve
written I don&#39;t want you to write in
this prison or we lock you in solitary
again and and Carol my wife was already
in nursing school in Santa Barbara and
she told me she said look just don&#39;t
publish anything until I graduate from
nursing school and because I don&#39;t want
to get transferred again because she
would always move from the prison
wherever I was so I agreed not to
publish anything and then she got her
first Nursing degree and I started
writing again and and of course I went
to the hole and when I went to the hole
the captain came to see me and said um
you know I told you not to publish from
here and I&#39;m going to keep you in the
hole and and you can&#39;t write books from
prison and I said well evidently you can
write books from prison that&#39;s why I&#39;m
here but he locked me in the hole and
and I had to you know litigate my way
out and I did I I did this thing called
administrative remedy and I prevailed
and I won the disciplinary infraction
and he and he came to see me and he said
well I still don&#39;t want you here his
name was Andy and it&#39;s I I I bring his
name up because later he proved to have
an influential role in the work that I
do now so he said I&#39;m still going to
ship you even though you won the
disciplinary infracture I&#39;m going to
ship you to another prison I went to a
prison in Bakersfield another Camp it
was called Taft it was a contract
facility so it wasn&#39;t even part of the
Bureau of Prisons but it was where sent
um some people in federal prison um and
I had a great experience there where I
wrote quite a few other books and
started to build this pathway for the
life that I wanted to lead when I got
out of prison and um toward the end of
my journey uh as
2011 uh I didn&#39;t know I I because I was
sentenced under the Old Law I never
really knew when I would get out I just
had a range because they had this thing
called the US parole commission back
then so I I knew that I could would
potentially serve somewhere between 24
years 23 years and 26 years and when I
got to my 25th year it was very close so
they said we&#39;ve got to send you to a
place where the parole commission can
meet you because you they don&#39;t come to
this nonfederal facility so they sent me
to Atwater in Northern California in
2011 and when I got there they looked at
all the things that I&#39;d done in prison
they said look if you stay here we can
get you to the parole commission or we
can give you a date right now if you
will agree to serve your last year in
the halfway house and I said I&#39;m ready
let me go to the halfway house so that
was in 2000 they said your release date
is August the 13 2012 it was a Monday
and I had a few months to prepare before
I got there and I remember my wife came
to pick me up and it was the first time
in 10 years of marriage that had ever
been with her outside of a visiting room
setting and it was just so magical for
me to be able to embrace her and kiss
her for the first time without officers
but I didn&#39;t have a lot of time because
I had to be at the halfway house in San
Francisco within three hours and if I
didn&#39;t get to the halfway house within
three hours I know the prison system
they&#39;ll give you a disciplinary
infraction it just means you can&#39;t go
for home passes later so we both knew we
had to get to the halfway house so got
in the car she had a pizza waiting for
me it was the main thing I wanted was a
pepperoni pizza and we started driving
to San Francisco and she&#39;d given me this
contraption that some of you may know
it&#39;s called an iPhone and I and I&#39;ll
always remember you know I&#39;d never been
on the internet I&#39;ve been reading about
it and you know I was so fascinated by
the internet I&#39;d been very active with
both universities and with technology
from what I&#39;d studied in prison but I
never used it so it&#39;s kind of like
reading about tennis that doesn&#39;t make
you a good tennis player and she gave me
the phone and I still remember putting
it to my phone I said this one&#39;s broken
there because there&#39;s no dial tone and
she showed me how to work and I said
well how do I get on the internet you
know what&#39;s the internet I want to get
on the internet I was so
excited and she kind of showed me and I
was playing with it while she was
driving me to San Francisco and uh I
remember when we came across the Oakland
Bridge coming into the bay because I had
to go to the tenderloin uh halfway house
and I saw those buildings and I got so
excited I said this is where I&#39;m going
to build my life and I was 49 years old
and I I remember telling her I&#39;m going
to make an impact now I&#39;m I&#39;m excited
about what I&#39;m going to do and I get to
the halfway house and have to go through
that whole rigar roll but I don&#39;t know I
I don&#39;t have anything right I I I&#39;ve
been in prison for a long time and I
have to build everything but I I I&#39;d had
these plans that really helped me
through so my my adjustment was
different I think from a lot of people
that served multiple decades in prison
and that I had a substantial amount of
money in the bank from my writing and
from other work that I had done and I
had a wife and I had a massive support
system bigger than I even
knew and uh but I I just didn&#39;t know how
to navigate the world and uh I had to
get a driver&#39;s license cuz you know I
didn&#39;t have anything like that so uh it
took a couple of days I think I got I
got there on a Monday by Wednesday the
case manager allowed me to go to the DMV
on Fel Street in San Francisco and my
friend a guy in met in prison I&#39;m
calling him on the phone because I I
have no idea how to navigate The Streets
of San Francisco and he&#39;s using these
maps and telling me okay turn left here
turn right there I eventually get to the
DMV and I get my driver&#39;s license but I
can assure you you you didn&#39;t want to be
on the road with me I I didn&#39;t know that
I forgot how to drive I don&#39;t know when
I forgot how to drive you&#39;d think you
never will forget how to drive but when
you&#39;re impr prisoned for 25 years and it
was 25 years in prison I did the last
year and a half I house when you&#39;re in
prison for 25 years you never move
faster than your legs can carry you and
so your eyes adjust and you know when
you&#39;re outside you know everything&#39;s
moving so fast so I I had studied the
DMV test so I knew how to pass the
written test but when I got behind the
wheel of a car I knew I don&#39;t know how
to drive and it took me some time to
learn and get comfortable I think and
that that was the funny thing is it took
several months before I became
comfortable as a driver even though I
had my driver&#39;s license so so I&#39;m I&#39;m
learning this path and I&#39;m in the
halfway house and going through these
stages and I think it was the first week
that I get a call from the editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle who said we&#39;ve
been following your story because I&#39;d
had this website um that that where I
was writing and Publishing about prison
all the time I&#39;d just write by hand I&#39;d
send it to my wife and she would publish
it and I&#39;d been doing that ever since
she came into my life so I&#39;d built a
pretty big following of people that were
interested in prisons and uh the editor
wrote me said we&#39;ve been following your
story for a long time and now that
you&#39;re back in the San Francisco would
you allow us to cover your story I said
I&#39;d love to so he does this story that
came out on Thanksgiving weekend of
2012 and I think it was the next Monday
I get a call start getting calls from
universities that are inviting me to
come and speak there and I was super
excited because up until that moment I&#39;d
never stepped foot on a University
campus in my life universities had a
huge role on my adjustment but I I never
went to school before prison and now I&#39;m
getting these calls from universities
and I and I had relationships with
people at Stanford and Berkeley and
other areas in the in the Bay Area that
that that had published with me and they
now they&#39;re inviting me to come and and
I remember the first place I went was UC
no uh San Francisco State University
that was the first campus I set foot
on and I give this presentation much
like I&#39;m giving right here talking about
the prison experience and and by then
I&#39;d written this book called earning
Freedom which is really this whole
concept that my career is around and and
I&#39;m telling the story and after I finish
it you know and I&#39;m only speaking to the
the criminal justice staff so there&#39;s
like five people I think in the room and
they said afterwards I said well would
you like a job and and and I just this
is the when I just gotten out of prison
and I said you know what is it that you
want me to do you know here thinking
they want me to do maintenance he said
uh we&#39;d like you to be a professor and I
said so that&#39;s all a guy&#39;s got to do is
go to prison for multiple decades and he
becomes a professor and this is the key
point that I try to tell people who are
living in jails or prisons or struggle
and he said no he said when I was in
grad school we had to read your books
and so I&#39;ve known about you for 10 years
and when I read the story in the
newspaper that&#39;s why I reached out but
we&#39;d love for you to teach here and I
said what do you want me to teach said
teach anything you want so I decided to
teach I wrote this course called the
architecture of incarceration and it was
this story of how Western Civilization
has responded to law Breakers
historically over time from the Medieval
Times to today and I wanted students it
was part of this advocacy effort that I
make and this is back in
2013 12 13 that
era um and and I wanted to help students
understand we could do better because
what prisons really do is they
perpetuate these intergenerational
cycles of failure and just keep
recidivism rates growing and I wanted to
change it and the way that I believed
that we could change it is by making it
more like America where you incentivize
people who are doing well instead of
just measuring Justice through the
through the number of calendar pages
that turn and they were receptive to
that and I use that story today to try
and change the system and and and
through that professorship I I had more
opportunities to advocate for Change and
and I I I published an article in UC
Hastings Law Journal called
incentivizing Excellence it was really
calling for ways that we could change
America&#39;s prison system and at that time
it was
in unheard of for anybody to be talking
about anything other than locking people
in prison for multiple decades if they
broke the law you know it was a tough on
crime era but we incarcerated more
people than any other nation and I think
it was a really bad I think it&#39;s really
bad for America and so I would publish
about this and that led to me getting
speaking engagements for judicial
conferences and you know any place and I
would go and speak anywhere that I could
because I knew I needed to get an
audience and I needed it help people see
something different and I got this
invitation to speak at a Judicial
conference for the ninth circuit where
there were thousand people there federal
judges and prison officials from all
states in the Western United States and
uh us attorneys and H there and I gave a
keynote speech that&#39;s very similar to
what I&#39;m talking about right now and I
would get these calls from the audience
in the Q&amp;amp;A that not everybody can do
what you did and and I would say well
you&#39;re you&#39;ll say that to me now you
know when you see me now after I&#39;ve got
the time before me but let&#39;s not forget
what the system said when I went into
the system that I should be in there for
300 years and still Justice would not be
served I said the reality is that
anybody can transform their life but I
need your help because I&#39;m the guy that
just got out of prison and I need more
influential people helping me spread
that message and um it was it was a
great opportunity that I got to scale
start visiting prisons in fact one of
the guys that came up to me afterwards
Al I was wearing a blue suit and he came
to me and he shook my hand he said do
you remember me and I said of course I
remember you&#39;re Andy mausan you locked
me in the hole back at Lao for doing
what these judges asked me to do and he
laughed and he said well I really like
what you&#39;re doing now and I&#39;m now a
warden and I&#39;d love for you to come to
my prison and give this presentation to
the men I said you know I could go and
give a presentation in a last you know
an hour or two hours and it&#39;ll be very
motivational you know but that&#39;s not
going to move the needle I said said why
don&#39;t you let me build a program and
bring it into the prison and and and he
said my prison is a really violent
prison it&#39;s gang a lot of Gang Related
he said if you could help me lower the
level of violence great we&#39;ll we&#39;ll
pilot the program there and then try and
grow and so we did and it was really
successful and and why not because I&#39;m a
great teacher but people could identify
with somebody that did a quarter century
and it gave them hope it helped them see
that they could be something more and
it&#39;s kind of funny because I would go
into the prison and my program is All
Digital and video and so I I I I I speak
in a camera and I try and give this
story but I will also go into prisons so
when I go in there they the first thing
they&#39;ll say is that fool was never in
prison you know and I&#39;ll say see you
think you&#39;re giving me an insult because
I don&#39;t look hard enough and and you
know I I I might not speak as if I was
in prison for 26 years but I always say
I got a little secret that that was the
plan you know the plan was to come back
to society and have nobody know that you
served a day in prison and that&#39;s what I
want for everybody here and that led to
the program spreading because I could
always make them three promises you know
it was one I&#39;m never going to lie to you
and two I&#39;m never going to ask you to do
something I didn&#39;t do and three I&#39;m
never going to ask you to pay me a penny
nobody has to pay me anything and that
would help me build credibility with the
people and help them build hope in
themselves and they start to see maybe I
can do this and I know that they can do
this and then you know the war Warden at
he was it was at the high security
penitentiary in Atwater he got promoted
to be the warden in Colorado which was
the nation&#39;s supermax and another high
security prison then he called me and he
called me and said could you bring the
program to Colorado and I said for sure
so I go to Colorado and we introduced it
there and it was really uh well received
and by the the people serving time and
then he got promoted again and now he&#39;s
a regional director one of six in the vi
of prison he said I want you now to come
to my region and so I brought it to
every prison in the north central region
um this program is called preparing for
Success after prison and then we got it
approved as a nationwide program and now
this program influences a million people
not only through my direct relationship
with prisons but also through
collaborations I make with other
nonprofits including the adobo
Foundation where we reach a million
people people who don&#39;t have access to
the internet but they have access to
these digital programs that we bring
into prison and the program is really
just about helping people see that you
can&#39;t wait for the government or the
prison system to change your life the
prison system is the prison system and
it&#39;s going to do what the prison system
does but it&#39;s super important to help
these people see and I don&#39;t use the
word inmate or convict or prisoner
they&#39;re people and I believe even people
I remember when they said when I was in
prison they said what are you an inmate
or a convict and I&#39;d say I&#39;m an American
I&#39;m a man and I want to change my life
and everybody should be able to do that
and and that&#39;s what I try to convey to
the people I said regardless of what the
system does what can you do and any
person in prison can do what Frederick
Douglas did that person can work to get
an education can work to write better
speak better think develop critical
thinking skills develop a self-directed
work ethic and anybody who does that is
going to put himself in a better
position to succeed and to build a life
and that&#39;s really what I feel my role is
is to become an ambassador of that
message that I learned from Nelson
mandala or Frederick Douglas or Victor
Frankle or all of these people who
inspired me through the
Journey and share it and just put it in
put what I learned from them into the
context of
2025 and help people start to believe in
themselves because there&#39;s too much of a
message in prison that you&#39;re supposed
to adjust in a certain way and
unfortunately that way frequently leads
to homelessness and at least to further
problems with the law to unemployment or
underemployment and and that&#39;s really
something I feel very passionately about
wanting to change and I need other
people to help me so so so I I go into
prison prisons frequently and give this
message not only through my videos of
prison professors but also in person and
that strategy is what I believe will
help me convince Americans that we
should change America&#39;s prison system so
that we shouldn&#39;t be proud of locking up
more people than any other Nation on the
planet we should be thinking about what
can we do better what can we do to help
people reach their Highest Potential and
that&#39;s what really all of our messaging
is about and I&#39;m super enthusiastic that
I get to do it but I I sometimes when
you go into prisons that people will say
I&#39;ve going through your program and and
I&#39;m really appreciative of what you&#39;re
doing but I I&#39;ve got 20 years and I
finished your program in a 100 hours you
know what else can you do and I said
well if you&#39;ve gone through the program
theoretically you should know what to do
because that&#39;s what I teach you&#39;ve got
to be self-directed I can&#39;t change your
life I can only show you what I learned
from Mandela how did I change mine and I
believe it will change yours but it
always bothered me that you know these
are serving long times and I wanted to
do more and I got super inspired by um
Brian chesky the founder and CEO of Arab
BNB and I was listening to a podcast I
like to listen to podcast it&#39;s one of
the reasons I&#39;m familiar with soft F
underbelly and I listen to podcast and I
learned from people and a really great
question somebody asked him was what was
the hardest thing you had had to do in
building your
company and he said the hardest thing
was during the covid pandemic he said I
had to lay off 2,800 people and when I
had to lay off 2800 people you know
these were my family these were people
that helped me build the company and and
it hurt but I have a responsibility to
shareholders and I had to let them go
and so I built this site section of the
site called airbnb.com Talent where I
profiled every person that was I was
laying off and I spoke about their skill
and about the role they had and helping
us build a great company and I
encouraged other people to hire them and
that inspired me so much that I said
that&#39;s something I can do cuz I I had
already become successful in business
and it wasn&#39;t any longer for me to work
for money it became about making an
impact and I launched prison professors
talent.com which is free for anybody
that&#39;s in custody anybody who&#39;s in jail
and what I encourage them to do is
memorialize your journey because you&#39;re
being shut off you know in America we
like to point accusatory fingers at
other nations and talk about how they&#39;re
violating human rights but I think if we
ask any American what is a human right
the answer is you know freedom of speech
freedom to communicate freedom to
improve your life well every day we&#39;re
violating the human rights of millions
of people who don&#39;t know how to function
in society because they&#39;re locked in
prisons they&#39;re they&#39;re going to pick up
iPhones and not know what to do with
them they&#39;re not going to know how to
use the tools of Technology because
they&#39;re locked in this world that that
blocks them and it leads to
intergenerational cycles of failure so I
decided to build prism vester&#39;s Talent
where we encourage people write your own
biography don&#39;t don&#39;t allow the
Department of Justice to Define who you
are tell us who you are and what did you
learn from this experience because other
people are going to want to know
two every time you read a book you
should learn something from that book
and you should write a report why did I
read this book what did I learn from
reading this book how is reading this
book going to contribute to my success
upon release four you should write a
Daily Journal tell me what you&#39;re doing
and why it&#39;s going to relate to what you
want to become and finally build your
own release plan and if you memorialize
this journey of your time in prison
you&#39;re going to find other people who
will help you just as I did you might
find a woman to marry you you might find
a publisher to give you a publishing
deal you might find an employer who says
I want you to be a part of my team and
that is the way that I try to scale this
message to reach not only people in
prison but also people out here which is
why I&#39;m super grateful for every
opportunity I I have to be able to share
my story and and markets one of the
reasons I&#39;m super grateful to you for
allowing me to share it with your
incredible audience so that&#39;s the story
that I have incredible thank you Michael
thank you you know your you know your
subject very well don&#39;t you I it&#39;s what
I live and it&#39;s I&#39;ve been out for 12
years but I still live it every day and
uh and yeah every day is an opportunity
to try and spread it to other people
amazing thank you very much thank
you when I was designing the first
softwood underbelly book I realized that
there were so many great portraits that
weren&#39;t going to make it into that
book they just wouldn&#39;t
fit and once I saw how well that first
book sold I knew I&#39;d have to design a
book this second book is finally ready
to ship like the first one this book has
a collection of some of the best
portraits from soft white underbelly
accompanied by a quote from that
interview this book features another
group of Rebecca portraits as well as a
collection of color images of the
Whitaker family and plenty of others you
can order yours for $125 or $150 for a
sign copy at soft white underbelly dorg
again like the first book once this book
is sold out I will not be printing more
of them the portraits are what softwood
underbelly is all about and these two
books contain the best of all that work
thank you for watching
