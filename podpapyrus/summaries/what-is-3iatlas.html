We have another interstellar visitor to
our solar system. This newly discovered
object invokes some profound questions.
Are we alone? Or are we just bumpers in
a lonely game of intergalactic pinball?
Avibe, a NASA scientist, puts a 40%
probability of alien origin on the
interstellar object 3i/Atlas.
Why is that? And what is so interesting
about three Atlas that members of
Congress are even considering diverting
the Juno probe to intercept it? Could
this object be of intelligent or
artificial origin?
Or is it totally natural? In either
case, what could we learn from such an
entity? What exceptional qualities make
Lo believe that this particular visitor
to our solar system is so special?
And what can we learn about our own
history here on Earth with the
exploration of such a celestial body?
Could the investigation and pursuit of
this and the other two recently
discovered interstellar interlopers
provide more insight into the events
that have shaped our world, our human
species, and our civilization?
Join us for this episode of Squaring the
Circle as we unpack the data on this
cosmic visitor as well as its two
predecessors and look at the
significance of these enigmatic objects
for humanity. I&#39;m Randall Carlson and
I&#39;ll see you in a minute.
Well, hello everyone. Welcome back to
Squar in the Circle. I&#39;m your host,
Randall Carlson, and I&#39;m going to be
joined by my co-host for this episode,
John Arthur Fio. Hello, John.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Howdy, sir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, so you&#39;ve been doing well since our
last recording together?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, sir. And you?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah, I&#39;ve been doing very
well. Um, I can always be doing better,
but I&#39;m doing very well. and uh hope to
keep that up for another at least half a
century. Half a century. Uh I might be
able to get most of what I would
anticipate wanting to accomplish if I
could have another half century. Okay.
uh some of those things we may actually
be getting into with today&#39;s topic which
is I think very interesting because as
we are both interested in the much
larger picture of our existence within
this cosmic domain we&#39;re finding that
there&#39;s constantly new questions being
uh we&#39;re being presented with these new
questions that raise some really
interesting
issues and one of those recently is this
discovery of this object. We&#39;re not sure
what it is yet. We&#39;re learning about it,
but it&#39;s uh it&#39;s called threei/las.
Now, do you know right off hand where it
got its name from? And then we&#39;ll get
into who discovered I know it was
discovered on July 1st, so it&#39;s
relatively rec.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Three Atlas. What? So the three I is is
it&#39;s the third interstellar option uh
object that uh uh we have we&#39;ve actually
tracked that we&#39;re we&#39;re very clear that
it&#39;s it&#39;s not in any sort of uh far
solar system orbit and uh it it was
actually found by the asteroid
terrestrial impact last alert system
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Atlas
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Atlas right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on July 1st 2025 I had Re read it over
here because that is quite the mouthful.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, let&#39;s read it once over again. I&#39;d
like to get I&#39;d like to. It&#39;s the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; asteroid terrestrial impact last alert
system. So they So the I is silent in
the acronym.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So okay. Yeah. So when we speak of its
name, but we we should speak of I. So
it&#39;s three.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The third inter is interstellar. a third
interstellar, not a solar system object,
an interstellar object
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because it&#39;s clearly coming from very
far away
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; out there somewhere.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it is passing through our solar
system, our celestial neighborhood.
Um, it&#39;s coming in, it&#39;s sort of out in
the fringes of the suburbs right now as
we speak, I believe. And it&#39;ll be coming
in. And when does it make its perihelion
passage around the sun? That is in March
16th I believe of next year.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I believe so. Let me pull this up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And let&#39;s define perihelion for anybody
who&#39;s not sure what that means. That is
the point at which in its orbit it&#39;s
passing closest to the sun. Per means
proximal close to helion is the sun.
It&#39;s close passage to the sun is going
to be on March 16th. Right. Was I right?
You&#39;re thinking about our best
opportunity to send a probe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to probe. Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From Juno. So Juno, which is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wouldn&#39;t get there till March 16th.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; March 16th to 26. When 29th is of this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; October 29th of this year. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So it&#39;s it&#39;s very close. And so it&#39;ll be
passing just outside of the orbit of uh
Jupiter. And it is going to be uh we&#39;re
not going to be able to see it. We&#39;re
going to be on the opposite side of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; during
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; during perihelion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; During perihelion, correct?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But we will pre
anti-parihelion and post perihelion. We
will be able to see it, I presume.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, we see it now. So, we&#39;re
obviously we&#39;re still going to see it
when it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, within the orbit of Mercury. Now
it does not it&#39;s there&#39;s no indication
that it&#39;s going to come within the I
mean it&#39;s more than an astronomical unit
away from the earth at its parigy right
which would be the closest passage to
the earth
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1.36
astronomical units.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right so let&#39;s define an
astronomical unit. An astronomical unit
is simply the distance from the earth to
the sun. So you said it&#39;s going to be
1.3. So I&#39;m then that three would be its
distance its perihelion distance. You
could think of it that way with of
course some adjustment for the size of
the sun because when that perihelion
measurement is given I presume that is
from the sun&#39;s measured from the sun&#39;s
center of mass
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rather than the sun&#39;s surface. That
would make more sense wouldn&#39;t it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But for round figures we can say it&#39;ll
be about.3 astronomical units on the
other side of the sun. So it&#39;ll be one
astronomical unit from the earth to the
sun, but you said it&#39;s going to be 1.3
astronomical units and and because of
the fact that the earth is essentially
on the other side of the sun, like if
this is the sun and this is the earth,
right? And then we have the object
coming around as it&#39;s making perihelion,
it&#39;s going to be pretty darn close to
parige at the same time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it would have to be. So it&#39;ll be at at
1.36 astronomical units from the sun.
It&#39;ll be at 126 million miles.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, that makes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; using freedom units.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that makes sense because in round
numbers, 93 million miles to the sun and
then we would multiply that by uh what
was it again? How many astronomical
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1.36
from the sun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1.36. So, times 1.36.
Yeah. And what did you say about 126
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; million miles? Yeah, that&#39;s what I came
up with. So, um so John and I were on
the same page.
what what about this object now? I mean,
we know it was preceded by uh let me see
if I can get this uh oamu mua. Amua mua
mua mua mua. Okay, that&#39;s kind of like
hunga hunga. This is mua mua.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is Hawaiian. I feel like I&#39;m going to
be put out to pasture every time I try
to say it, so forgive me native
speakers. Uh but yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s
going to be something we stumble over.
And Boris, two Boris.
And so both of these were very very
interesting. In fact, I can actually
pull up a graphic uh that shows both of
their trajectory here. Uh give me just a
and I can pull this up really quick.
So, here we have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; courtesy of Wikipedia, but ultimately uh
I believe this is from JPL.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So the red line, if you&#39;re if
you&#39;re on audio, I apologize, but Amomo
comes in at a very acute angle and
passes very close in our solar system.
And that was the first one in 2017. And
then Boris
uh uh two Boris comes along at this very
uh obtuse angle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So let&#39;s look at those angles. So
I it&#39;s looking to me there like okay
look when the when the two objects are
making perihelion
Mua Mua is much closer to the sun than
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Boris well then
that is affecting the shape of their
orbits there because what&#39;s happening is
that powerful gravity field of the sun
is pulling uh omuam mua in uh and
wrapping it around close whereas the
effect on Borosov is much less because
Borosov is outside the orbit of Mars. So
it&#39;s quite a ways from the sun. So its
gravity field is not going to distort
its orbital trajectory nearly as much as
we see happening with OmuA Mua.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
Now where by comparison where will let&#39;s
see you said that um uh where does um
Atlas fall?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You you&#39;ll actually see it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5 5% within the the plane of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which is interesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now let&#39;s let&#39;s clarify that plane of
the ecliptic is going to be the earth&#39;s
orbit around the sun. As the earth
orbits the sun and sweeps out a flat
plane, that&#39;s what we call the plane of
the ecliptic. So-called because the
eclipses only occur when the moon is
precisely crossing that plane, the the
flat field of earth&#39;s orbital plane.
Think of it as just a two-dimensional
plane and earth is orbiting. But kind of
perhaps coincidentally, the moon&#39;s tilt
relative to the plane of the ecliptic is
So it&#39;s essentially the same as Atlas&#39;s
angle of the ecliptic. Not that that has
any significance or meaning to it, but I
just note that that it is tilted at the
same angle as the moon is to Earth&#39;s
orbital path, which is called the plane
of the ecliptic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so I I I think hearing a a quick
excerpt from Avi Loab and then I think
we should dig into the news.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On this uh would be appropriate because
Avi Lo is a is a researcher and
scientist and he&#39;s made some really
interesting claims. But I I think it&#39;s
you and I were talking about this
beforehand. I&#39;m not going to spoil too
much. Uh this is a a interview that he
did on CNN.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
Okay, so we&#39;re bringing in Harvard
astronomy department chair um Avi Loe.
Thanks so much for being with us. Um I
want to start with this this thing we&#39;re
talking about. It&#39;s the the threeey
atlas comet. NASA&#39;s like, look, it&#39;s got
an icy nucleus. It&#39;s got that cloud of
gas and dust. Um we&#39;ve got the Hubble.
We&#39;ve got the web. They&#39;ve all these
telescopes have shown that there&#39;s no
strange signals, no maneuvers, nothing
artificial. Why do you think it could be
artificial or alien technology?
which is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well the brightness thanks for having me
by the way. Uh the brightness of the
object implies a diameter of 20
kilometers and there is not enough rocky
material in interstellar space to
deliver such a giant object
per decade. It takes 10,000 years for
that much mass to arrive to the inner
part of the solar system. Moreover, the
trajectory of this object is very
fine-tuned. It lies in the plane of the
orbits of the planets around the sun to
within five degrees. The chance for that
to happen is one in 500. And moreover,
it passes very close to Jupiter, Mars,
and Venus with a chance of one per
20,000 if you just change the arrival
time randomly. Uh, and it will arrive
closest to the sun when the Earth would
be on the opposite side. We won&#39;t be
able to observe it, but that&#39;s the
perfect time for it to maneuver. And so
um we just need to watch it. I&#39;m not
saying it&#39;s an alien technology. I&#39;m
just saying it doesn&#39;t look like a very
common thing. And actually the glow that
is around this object usually for comets
you see a trailing tail behind the
object. And here the glow from the
Hubble Space Telescope image is actually
in front of the object. We&#39;ve never seen
such a thing. A comet doesn&#39;t have glow
in front of it. But can you tell me why
your position on this is so different
from NASA&#39;s and why in your paper about
it you kind of talk about this as a a a
thought experiment pedological kind of
exercise? Um you&#39;re you&#39;re casting doubt
and then NASA is saying it&#39;s not true.
So why keep talking about it this way?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, science is about asking any
uh that you like. It&#39;s not there is no
censorship on the type of question that
is being asked and the scientific method
is about using data to select the
correct answer. Now assuming in advance
that you know the answer is not a
productive approach. We need to collect
enough data and you know there should be
uh a scale that classifies objects
between zero where it&#39;s obvious that
they are natural when the there is a
cometary tail behind them. They don&#39;t
have a special orbit. There is nothing
unusual about them. And a 10 when it&#39;s
definitely an artificial object where it
maneuvers, there are some artificial
lights. And we should look carefully at
any interstellar object that comes into
the solar system. We are in a new era
now that the Reubin Observatory in Chile
will find a new interstellar object
every few months. And I&#39;m suggesting to
leave all possibilities on the table
because we launched probes to
interstellar space. Voyager, Pioneer,
New Horizons. And uh why should we
assume that we are the only one in our
cosmic neighborhood? Uh we should just
check by looking at data. It&#39;s not a
matter of opinion. It&#39;s not a matter of
NASA having authority on this matter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I hope to see that data soon. Alo,
thanks so much.
So I love the fact that that he says,
&#34;Hey, this is what science is. It&#39;s
about getting a an abundance of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, she says, &#34;Why do you keep talking
that way?&#34; You know, like look, NASA has
has declared omnisient, all powerful,
all knowing NASA, you know, uh has
declared that that&#39;s there&#39;s no evidence
of it being artificial. So why do you
keep talking about it this way? Well, I
I&#39;m not endorsing the idea that it&#39;s
artificial. Of course not. Uh I don&#39;t
know. But he&#39;s pointing out that this is
a unique object. It&#39;s an enigma. It
doesn&#39;t fit the pattern. It&#39;s something,
like he said, we&#39;ve never really seen
anything quite like this before. So, it
naturally raises questions. But this is
typical CNN. I mean, this is typical
mainstream media here. Well, why keep
talking about it this way? We&#39;ve got,
you know, we&#39;ve got NASA. Well, okay.
So, I don&#39;t know what is it over 100,000
employees in NASA. I&#39;m just curious how
many employees in NASA. Um, probably out
of the whole paniply of NASA employees,
there&#39;s two or three guys, maybe just
one guy who&#39;s who&#39;s doing the scientific
research on this has concluded it is
more likely a comet of some kind, an
unusual comet, which is what I would be
inclined to believe.
But you know, Avi Lo, he&#39;s a theoretical
astrophysicist. He&#39;s a cosmologist. I
mean, his his take on this is of of
value. And she&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, well, why do
you disagree with NASA? You know, NASA
has said given the final word on this,
there&#39;s no mystery. Let&#39;s just move on.&#34;
And he says, &#34;Well, no, no, there&#39;s all
kinds of things.&#34; And we&#39;re going to
look at some of those things to try to
uh try to get a better handle on this.
Now, ground news is what we&#39;ve now
started using for our research into
current events and topical uh questions
like like this one. Um, and we will talk
about ground news because I&#39;m really
excited about using ground news as
another research tool. But so, we&#39;ve got
ground news up here and we&#39;ve got the
heading from Harvard professor believes
interstellar comet could be alien
spacecraft. Well, we just Is that the
same? Is this Avi Lo?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s Avi Lobe.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So, we just heard from him and
what we heard does not support this
headline. He says, &#34;Now, I&#39;m not saying
or I don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s what it
is, but we have to be open and consider
all possibilities because we&#39;ve never
seen anything like this before. But this
headline here is misleading.&#34; Now, do we
know the source of this? This is uh from
where? So this is an amalgamation of a
couple of different uh uh sources. But
if we go to the bias comparison here, we
can look at how left-leaning and
right-leaning out uh outfits actually
use and and uh filter the data into
their headlines and how they run. And
that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s actually really
cool to have them on as a sponsor. they
actually reached out to to us
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and we&#39;re actually really uh it&#39;s
exciting to use them as a tool
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and already it&#39;s proving to be uh
exceptionally valuable and time-saving.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then the other thing that you and I
were playing with Randall was the blind
spot tool.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Which I really like. Um because
yeah, I&#39;ve I&#39;ve thought all along and I
have not put it in those terms. I&#39;ve
thought for years, you know, God,
there&#39;s a there there&#39;s a blind spot on
the left there. They just don&#39;t see this
stuff. And then same thing on the right.
Now lately I&#39;ve been more sympathetic to
the right. Let&#39;s say in fact that
turning really I think shifted in the
Clinton years. But but still I&#39;m
critical of the right and I think they
have their blind spots and that&#39;s why I
choose to be an independent and look at
both sides. Um because I think I have
developed enough discernment over the
the years of my life that I can tell uh
when something is credible and when
something is not credible. when somebody
is ignoring evidence, uh when somebody
is uh uh endorsing a particular point of
view, but still having that definition
set out like we&#39;re doing right here
really is helpful. I mean, it really
helps to define that you do have these
two dominant perspectives uh in American
political and public life. And what it
appears to me ground news is doing is
making it very straightforward to
be able to see where on the political
spectrum some a story is originating,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Because why? Well, why is this
valuable? For one thing, that is, I
think, critical to being able to help
people see through propaganda,
to know where it&#39;s coming from, right?
And we just saw this clip uh with this
interviewer with Avi Loe, and I made the
comment to you that that appears to be
typical CNN, and we know where CNN is
falling on the spectrum. But now there&#39;s
a lot of uh I I think this is an organic
movement. I mean, look at this. We&#39;ve
got so many different Let&#39;s look at some
of the ones that they&#39;re representing
here. Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got Trump
having a a a discussion on the plight of
children in war. only 8% of the
reporting sites were on the left.
Whereas on the right side, Trump&#39;s
discussing Sean Hannity&#39;s uh
relationship with Aninsley Earheart and
you have 0% of the the right-wing media
uh reporting on it whereas left and
center comprise the whole. So, if you
are in a silo, this is a great way to
get out. And and right now, if you guys
use the the code here on the screen
right now or the one down below in the
pin comment, you can get 40% off of
Randall&#39;s Vantage plan, the one that
he&#39;s been using for the last couple of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And as I&#39;m getting more and more
familiar with the with the uh the tool
here uh and the power of this tool, I&#39;m
finding myself using it more and more
frequently. I&#39;m adding it to you know I
use Google Scholar as a research tool. I
use research gate several others uh that
I find to be very helpful uh you know
trying to track down stories and get
different perspectives. So this now I&#39;ve
added ground news uh particularly uh you
know with with breaking events that I&#39;m
interested in researching like the one
we&#39;re talking about right now. Anyhow,
this paper that you
uh downloaded from is the interstellar
object uh alien technology. There it is.
Let&#39;s go through there&#39;s um some of
those the points that this has got to be
the same guy, right? Abraham lobe
with Harvard University.
Yeah, it must be this must be avi
short contraction for Abraham.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh yeah, it is the same fellow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Same guy. Yeah, there we are. Just
looked him up on Wikipedia. A Abraham
Avi lobe. Avi in quotation marks. So
that&#39;s kind of a yeah a contraction, a
nickname. Uh
yeah, he&#39;s the lobe is the Frank B. Bear
Junior Professor of Science at Harvard
University where since 2007 he has been
director of the institute for theory and
computation at the center for
astrophysics.
Uh he chaired the department of
astronomy from 2011 to 2020 and founded
the black hole initiative.
Um I am not familiar with the black hole
initiative
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is that are we going to mount an
expedition to a black hole
is that in our coming up here I don&#39;t
think that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; first worldwide center to focus on the
study of black holes a collaborative
interdisciplinary collective is the
harvard.edu edu slug.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
Okay. So, let&#39;s look here. says, &#34;In the
abstract, at this early stage of its
passage through our solar system, 3
the recently discovered interstellar
interloper
has displayed various anomalous
characteristics determined from
phototric and astrometric observations
as largely a pedagogical is pedagogical
pedagogical I think it&#39;s pedagogical
exercise.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. In this paper, we present
additional analysis into the astronamics
of threei Atlas. And I think I from now
on I will just refer to it as Atlas and
hypothesize that this object could be
technological
and possibly hostile as would be
expected from the dark forest resolution
to the Fermy paradox. We talked a little
bit about that before the show and you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so the Fermy paradox I think we should
start with the Fermy paradox which is
the idea that hey there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot
of space
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; why are we the only ones are we the only
ones does that make sense statistically
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then the dark forest resolution to
the firmy paradox is well if there were
advanced civilizations and they all had
the proclivity to conquer,
would they really be interested in
broadcasting their presence or would
they work through spy satellites,
probes, etc. And this is where a lob&#39;s
coming from. Could this be a uh a
tactically
disguised probe that&#39;s just passing
through the solar system? And are the
the emissions of hydroxil uh a form of
station keeping fuel? Something that
looks like it&#39;s a uh comet or asteroid,
but it&#39;s acting in a very very unusual
manner. And the fact that it&#39;s on the
planet the ecliptic, it&#39;s going to come
right by us while we&#39;re on the opposite
side of the sun.
You know, he&#39;s saying, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m asking
questions.&#34; That&#39;s all he&#39;s doing. What?
What? What show was that? I&#39;m just
asking questions. That&#39;s what Avi Loe&#39;s
take is here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m just asking questions. That was a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that there was a show
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; where somebody was asking questions.
Yes, there was. Um
goes on to say here, we show that Atlas
approaches surprisingly close to Venus,
Mars, and Jupiter with a probability of
less than or approximately
0.005. 005%.
That&#39;s one part in 500, I guess, right?
Furthermore, the low retrograde tilt of
three Atlas&#39;s orbital plane to the
ecliptic offers various benefits to an
extraterrestrial intelligence since it
allows the object access to our planet
with relative impunity.
The eclipse by the sun from Earth of
ThreeI Atlas at perihelion would allow
it to conduct a clandestine reverse
solar oirth maneuver. An optical optimal
high thrust strategy for interstellar
spacecraft to break and stay bound to
the sun. Now let&#39;s go into a solar oirth
Uh, do you have something on that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I watched it on Star Trek. It&#39;s what
they did with the Enterprise, right? The
fourth the fourth movie. The Oirth
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You don&#39;t remember? You don&#39;t remember
the the original the the original uh
fourth movie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Where they did an oirth
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t remember that. I I remember did
I see the fourth one?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Was it the fourth or the fifth one where
they had the whales? It was the one
where they had the whales and they did
travel. They were trying to So the the
oirth maneuver is where you fly into the
into a nexus of gravity orbiting the sun
or say Jupiter, which we&#39;ll talk about
in a little bit. But that&#39;s where you&#39;re
you&#39;re traveling close enough to the
gravity that you can use it as a
slingshot.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As a slingshot. Yeah. Slingshot maneuver
is the is the layman&#39;s term that I&#39;m
more familiar with.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a technique used in space travel
where a spacecraft accelerates while
falling into a gravitational well such
as a near planet. And the thing is, if
my understanding is correct, this high
rate of speed of Atlas is going to make
it especially suitable for an oberth
maneuver when it transits perihelion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh it can use the sun&#39;s gravity to
what? To accelerate it,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; accelerate back out. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back out. Okay. This method is more
efficient for gaining speed
compared to accelerating outside of a
gravitational field as it takes
advantage of the spacecraft&#39;s higher
velocity at that point. We will mention
that the perihelion is the highest
velocity in in an orbital system that
because it&#39;s as it&#39;s falling into the
sun, it&#39;s getting drawn in closer and
closer. The gravity field of the sun is
having more and more effect and that
effect manifests as an acceleration in
its orbit. Once it crosses that
perihelion passage and continues out,
it&#39;s now moving away from the sun.
Right? So now the gravity field of the
sun is pulling it back. It&#39;s wanting to
like put the brakes on. Right? What the
old birth maneuver is is they&#39;re using
that acceleration as it falls towards
the sun to slingshot it, as you said. uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and as it gets closer it&#39;ll it&#39;ll
slingshot out. Now if this is naturally
occurring then it is just a very very
interesting
uh passage very unlikely.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So my question is is how often does this
actually happen? How many interstellar
objects do we have? You know do we we
obviously don&#39;t have 20 kilometer wide
objects passing through every day.
But we we have like the meteor
stream which is which is a local
phenomenon.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Some people have some scientists have
thrown out potentially up to 10,000
interstellar objects passing through our
solar system. Some of them the size of a
a you know a rock you could throw and
some of them much much larger. Oh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but this one is this one is unique.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s unique. possibly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s big. As far as observation goes,
it&#39;s very unique.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a coma,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? There&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a
center nucleus that that is glowing, but
there&#39;s not a heck of a lot of a tail
right now,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so that that makes it interesting
because as something gets closer to the
sun, what what happens to the ice and to
all the volatiles, Randall? What happens
to a comet as it gets closer to the sun?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They sublimate
and then they outgass and they form that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s evidence of something burning
whereas or or sublimating right as it
gets closer to the sun. So the question
is why is this a
uh so so
And we&#39;re we&#39;re going to get into the
water volatile issue in just a little
bit. how much how many how how massive
is this in terms of volatiles on the on
the mass but also B why is it not
showing the tail that NASA would have
expected it to show
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s interesting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so what we have here
uh that graphic you just had up that
shows the uh the orbital trajectory of
three I atlas as it&#39;s coming in we see
that outer
orange or yellow ring is Jupiter and
it&#39;s coming we see that it&#39;s coming
within the orbit of Mars
and now this is actually okay if we look
we see that the uh that the object is
right up uh towards the upper right and
that&#39;s basically now correct at at
present and then so in October
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s going to be passing down there
it&#39;ll be passing very close to Mars.
Mars is uh moving, if you look at Mars
on that orange circle, it&#39;s moving uh
counterclockwise
as we&#39;re looking down on it. But and you
can see that Atlas is moving the
opposite direction. So we would say that
Mars is in a prograde
um and uh Atlas is in a retrograde
which means that it&#39;s really moving fast
through the interplanetary zone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You had a great analogy to describe
prograde and retrograde from the
perspective of someone driving in a car.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For those who are who are not familiar.
Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s like you&#39;re driving down
a highway and you know you&#39;ve got you&#39;re
in one direction, you&#39;ve got cars coming
in the other direction, and let&#39;s say
you go to pass the car in front of you,
right? Well, assume that the car in
front of you is a planet and it&#39;s moving
forward in a prograde and you pass it,
right? I I I recently watched another
analogy that will kind of fit this as
well is that um one of my oldtime
favorite movies back from the 80s was
called The Lone Riders. It was about
Jesse James and the Younger Gang and and
um there&#39;s a scene in there where
they&#39;re going to rob a train. And it
looked to me like not it looked to me
like the actual actors up there
galloping their horses, right? So they
gallop up alongside the train. They get
going. So, the horses are galloping
almost as fast as the train is going.
They&#39;re able to lean over, grab on, and
and jump into the moving train, right?
Well, that you see would be like if
Comet Atlas or Atlas was in a prograde,
it would be moving the same direction
around the sun as the all the planets
are. But now imagine that Jesse James is
going to rob the train, but he&#39;s riding
the horse in the opposite direction that
the plane is moving. Well, he&#39;s not
going to have nearly the easy time
jumping onto the train if because now
you&#39;ve got to add
the velocity of the horse galloping to
the velocity of the train moving in
opposite directions. Right? So, what we
have here is that this object is going
to be in a retrograde orbit. Now, I&#39;m
still trying to wrap my head around what
does that actually mean? Well, it means
it&#39;s going to zip through mighty damn
quick. We concluded it was 60 uh the one
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; over 60 kilometers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we saw one estimate there was 64
kilometers per second.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s 64 km. And uh what does that work
out to be in miles per hour? Well, we we
calculated that a little earlier. Uh I
can obviously do it again. If I go 64
km, I go 3 times 3.28.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s 136,000
miles per hour. per hour.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so this is where I think it really
becomes relevant to all all of your work
how often do we get baseball size or or
objects like this coming through? Even
if it&#39;s not the meteor stream, what
would what would a vehicularsized
asteroid coming through at
136 m,000 miles per hour, what would
that do to a small coastal village?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh my god. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If it even if it impacts the water,
what&#39;s it going to do?
You know, so so the the question is, you
know, we&#39;ve got our model of the ORC
cloud. We&#39;ve got our you know all you
know the the Kyper Kyper disc. The qu
next question is is are we in a larger
set of streams.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Something that&#39;s worth worth exploring.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I agree. And are we you know like Avi Lo
said in that interview you know we&#39;re
just this is a whole whole new frontier
for us. Um
so let&#39;s see hypervelocity impact
involves the projectile moving at very
high velocities such as asteroid and
meteorites. Uh the energy associated
with the impact load
uh is a function of the mass and
velocity of the impactor.
So those are the two primary things. The
energy released is going to be uh a
function of the velocity. And an analogy
I use there is that, you know, let&#39;s say
I had a
uh let&#39;s say I had a a a 38 caliber
bullet, all right, out of its shell,
just a 38 out of its casing. And I&#39;ve
just got a 38 caliber shell, caliber
bullet, little lead bullet, and you&#39;re
standing across the room from me, and I
throw it at you, and I throw it really
hard, and it&#39;s moving
50, 60 miles per hour. I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s going to be move fast as a as a uh
you know a major league baseball pitcher
throwing at a a ball at over 90 miles an
hour. But but let&#39;s say I throw it at
you even as hard as I can and it hits
you and you go ow. Hey, but it&#39;s not
going to do any damage, is it?
But suppose I accelerate that to 2,000
ft per second, which is the speed of a
pretty much a highowered rifle bullet.
Now look at what that little lead B
bullet will do to you when it strikes
you. And the only difference now even no
difference in mass only difference is in
And now that energy that&#39;s released uh
could kill you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so this thing is moving. I mean, if it
was to strike some I mean, if an object
if it if it&#39;s on a high and we don&#39;t
know. I&#39;m going to be really curious in
in monitoring this because I&#39;d like to
know really how big this thing is. But
if Avi Lo is corrected, it&#39;s could be
upwards of 20 what was it you said 20
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 20 km
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 20 km is going to be about 12 miles in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, 12 miles in diameter. That&#39;s twice
the diameter of the KT impactor. And we
know what that did. And of course, uh, I
don&#39;t know the shape of this thing, but
unlike Ou Muam Mua, which looked like a
cigar, this thing may be more spherical.
But, you know, the sphere the the the
the volume of a sphere scales by the
cube of the radius.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for those who haven&#39;t seen a MUA MUA,
looks something like this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ah, there it is. Yes. Look at this
thing. Now, that was a weird looking
thing, wasn&#39;t it? So that was one eye.
The first one that we&#39;re familiar with
is AmuA Mua. Borisav was was kind of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then Amua was just a general
asteroid. Nothing too unusual, but Amua
Mua was very interesting. It&#39;s like
this. It&#39;s like this uh uh atlas. It&#39;s
it&#39;s unusual
uh in shape. It looks like it&#39;s young.
It looks like it hasn&#39;t been chipped
And so just for fun, one more for you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we have a onem
wide iron asteroid, let&#39;s say it hits
New York.
Bye-bye New York.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 37 mile wide crater.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 70 mile wide fireball.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 126 decel shock wave.
and you have 9.0 magnitude uh uh
earthquake. So that&#39;s just one mile. And
so you know
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try 12 for a moment and see what that
looks like.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That would be pretty much that would
probably sterilize the planet.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That would be an endgame endgame.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Endgame event. There might be microbial
life surviving. I don&#39;t think any of
higher life the probably the whole 90%
of the food chain is gone
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; correct
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um from from an object and then again
how fast is it moving um these this what
was the the the velocity of this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 136 miles per hour a thousand 136,000
miles per hour 136k there we go
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; oh yeah and chances are though they&#39;re
not going to be moving that fast what
makes this enigmatic is that high
velocity which is you know five, six,
seven times faster than normal objects.
We see comets move tend to move faster
than asteroids.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um but you know we might be looking at
uh you know 15 miles per second 15 miles
per second as compared to you know 60
miles. So it&#39;s one quarter the velocity
of this thing roughly ballpark. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so the other thing that makes this
enigmatic and you and I calculated this
before we found this through through
ground news actually uh water detection
in interstellar object 3i atlas remember
you and I were doing some computations
before on how much water was coming off
of this thing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; based on what you and I read here. Did
did you write that down by any chance?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I believe I did. Let&#39;s see. We&#39;re
talking a significant out outpouring of
water. And this is this is where Avi Lo
is saying that this is an interesting
object because it&#39;s outgassing at a very
high rate.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh
let&#39;s see. While you look for that uh
the detection of O emission prior to any
cyanogen CN uh detection is unusual and
may reflect differences in grain driven
outgassing or volatile inventory
compared to a t typical comet which
makes it unique worth studying I think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So how much water is this thing pouring
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Um
I let&#39;s see. Oh, okay. We did get we did
calculate that. Uh, works out about
3,500 tons per day. About 3,500 tons per
day of water. So, if I go 3,500,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh, see, 3,500. I divide that by 24.
That&#39;s about 145 tons
per hour
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of water.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of water. Divide that by 60 and that&#39;s
about 2 and 12 tons per minute.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So what is this thing? It has to be
It has to be young or it had to start
off as massive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for there to be this much volatile
material. Normally, you know, volatiles,
things, compounds that are going to out
gas or, you know, when they&#39;re exposed
to the sun, normally they&#39;re a sign of
of age or addition or uh you know, those
that much water doesn&#39;t typically
you can&#39;t pour out that much water for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s a lot.
So, where is that water coming from? And
I I think it&#39;s a reasonable question.
And it should we should ask is this
thing very young or is this thing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. So here we go. This is the
the evidence nine different discrete
pieces of evidence that uh define this
object as being enigmatic. And we&#39;ll go
through some of these here. The first
one is the fact that the orbital plane
lies virtually in the ecliptic though
retrograde.
I equ=
So that would then be if we subtracted
that from 180 that would give us the
inclination of the orbit which is what
that I stands for. Um so actually if we
did 180
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s four 4.89 degrees.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4.89 degrees. So a little bit less than
5 degrees. Okay.
Um and he says here about this uh that
the uh taking the first row in table one
it appears that besides the fact that it
is clearly a hyperbolic trajectory.
Let&#39;s just talk about that for a second
because a hyperola is one of the family
of conic sections along with parabas and
ellipses and circles.
In nature, we don&#39;t find any orbits that
are perfect circles. Some of them are
they&#39;re all orbits are uh at least in
the inner solar system. And when you
were mentioned the torid shower, the
torid meteor stream earlier, they&#39;re all
in elliptical orbits. An elliptical an
ellipse is a geometric figure that&#39;s
closed, right? So if if we look at an
object, a meteorite, a comet that&#39;s in
an elliptical orbit, we know it&#39;s
closed. we know it&#39;s going to be coming
back, right? But a hyperola is not
closed. It&#39;s open
and apparently has no closure at any
point. So if uh a an object is on a
hyperbolic orbit, it&#39;s going to come in,
but it&#39;s not going to close that loop
and and and turn around and come back.
It&#39;s going to just simply come in. It&#39;s
going to have its pathway. its orbital
trajectory modified by the gravitational
attraction of the sun or Jupiter or any
any other gravitational object that it
passes in the vicinity of is going to
affect to a greater or lesser degree its
orbital path. A hyperbolic orbit is what
we have here. So it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not
something that&#39;s going to go out and
then presumably come back unless the
ellipse is so huge that for all
practical purposes it is not coming back
within the life of the universe. Um
anyways, so what what he&#39;s saying here
is that um
it is clearly on a hyperbolic trajectory
that possesses a nonzero speed at an
infinite distance from the sun of
approximately 60 kilometers per second.
There is further extremely unusual There
is a further extremely unusual feature
of 3i Atlas&#39;s trajectory which is that
its orbital plane is tilted only
slightly from the ecliptic and is
retrograde. This mean this means
attempts by humanity to intercept it or
even more diff or even more difficult
rendevous with it are extremely
challenging if not impossible with
chemical rockets yet nonetheless as we
shall see allows three Atlas to
intercept certain key target planets
with relative ease. So again, that the
idea we want to intercept it, it&#39;s like,
you know, Jesse James riding the wrong
way down the railroad tracks. You&#39;re
going to have a hard time leaping onto
that train car to rob the the the
passengers or the the the the the strong
box with the with the uh with the the
the the money in it or the gold or
whatever it might be. So that&#39;s what
he&#39;s saying here. It makes it very
difficult for us to actually um
intercept it. Um but then uh it does
allow it to intercept certain key target
planets with relative ease.
Furthermore, a low ecliptic tilt at a
distance from the sun would enable an
extraterrestrial an ETI
uh an extraterrestrial intelligence
through astrometric measurements to
determine the orbits and masses of the
solar system planets allowing it to
prepare an optimal approach strategy to
the solar system. So, I mean, from that
perspective, you could almost think of
it as a um oh, like what would you call
it? A recon satellite.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that&#39;s what Lo is is suggesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Now, he&#39;s saying, of course, that
he doesn&#39;t really even believe that, but
he&#39;s just doing it as a pedagogical
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 40% is a strong 40% certainty is a
strong uh number.
And the likelihood for such a perfect
alignment of the orbital angular
momentum the angular momentum vector
around the sun for earth and 3 i atlas
is uh 2 * 10 the minus3 so 2 over a,000
so about one part and 500
that&#39;s uh and an interesting formula
here it&#39;s pi
Then it&#39;s got the inclination of 5
degrees divided by 57 degrees. And I&#39;m
not sure why that is. I&#39;m going to have
to look into this. But that division of
5 over 57 is then squared and divided by
4 pi. And that gives you the uh gives
you the odds. Uh
yeah, missions to atlas would have been
much easier had the interstellar object
interstellar object been traveling in
the ecliptic plane. prograde.
Obviously,
figure one illustrates opportunities
of uh to threei Atlas expire by the year
end and even then would only be
achievable for a SpaceX Starship
refueled in low Earth orbit and a
spacecraft payload with nuclear thermal
propulsion.
And so you&#39;ve got um
uh thus
uh so this this graphic here since I
have we we just downloaded this paper I
haven&#39;t had a chance to study it yet. We
have the color contours of
characteristic energy
C3 for direct missions. Okay. So what
this is doing is showing us the the
potential launch windows.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And so it looks to me like
uh launch date after
July 2025 starts to go disappear
I think that&#39;s what this is showing us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yep. Yep. Your your your X is your time
and your Y is your flight duration.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And if you&#39;re if you&#39;re on audio, my
apologies. You&#39;ll just have to look at
this on the video, but uh you&#39;re looking
at the the color is 14 kilometers
per second.
Uh sorry. Yeah. 14 kilometers/ second
Yeah. And then negative to the -2.
That&#39;s intense.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So we&#39;ve got this. Yeah. And and
that is going to rapidly that that
intercept window is rapidly going to
close. I think that&#39;s the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and so the key here
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that there&#39;s only one vague long shot at
getting at getting this done. And uh I I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work based on
what little bit of knowledge I have. But
uh Rep. Anna Paulina Luna actually
suggested this as you know.
And so
she suggests that the Juno probe
potentially be retasked because it&#39;s
going out and it&#39;s going to pass by
Jupiter on its way out. And that&#39;s the
March 16th date, 2026,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is is our is our is our best shot on
that mid-March.
So it&#39;s so her she finishes her letter.
Uh, it is recommended that NASA conduct
a study to assess how much fuel is left
in Juno&#39;s engines. And I support the
extension of the Juno mission at least
until mid-March 2026 at a cost of about
15 million per 6 months from current
expiration date of midepptember 2025.
The exciting new goal to study 3i Atlas
will rejuvenate Juno&#39;s mission and
extended scientific lifespan beyond
March 14th, 2026.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even if Juno&#39;s engine cannot be
reactivated, Juno can gather
unprecedented data from three eye atlas
from its current orbit around Jupiter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, here she has it at uh uh
kilometers per second.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is the speed.
Well, and this was this was when because
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sheep like we said on the 1st of August.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So, this is probably an update
because it&#39;s going to be accelerating as
it moves in towards perihelium.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I mean this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, this is her expost and there&#39;s
a reader note here. Uh readers added
context they thought people might want
to know. As of July 4th, 2016, the Juno
spacecraft had 785 uh kilograms of
propellant on board with its uh uh 1,593
kg dry mass and a hydrogen uh NTO
specific impulse estimated at uh 339s.
The spacecraft had 1332
m/s of delta V left at that date. Well
below the 26 uh or 2,675
meters/s required for Rep. Luna&#39;s
proposal. So that&#39;s what, you know, the
internet is responding with. They&#39;re
saying, &#34;Hey, you can get close, but
not as close as we would want.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Right. So there there are
proposals though to loft other other
craft to be ready because we had 2017 I
believe was mua mua.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Borisav was in 2019
if if memory serves and then of course
we have this in 25.
So Atlas is in 2025. So, how many of
these objects are flowing through and
and what kind of effect have they had
on Earth
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; questions that make you go hm?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
Well, let&#39;s see what in this paper they
go on to say that um
so aside or apart from the hypothesis
proposed already which is the idea of a
alien spacecraft
two distinct yet natural incarnations
present themselves for this object.
One it can either be an asteroid or a
comet. Those would be the first things
you know being more uh you know more um
parochial if you will uh with the
without going into the exotic realm of
alien spacecraft. The two main choices
of what it would be would be an asteroid
or a comet.
If it&#39;s an asteroid and you assume a
standard albido, which is the the
reflection of the light off the surface
of the of the asteroid, and given how
much light we&#39;ve seen reflecting off of
it, which is quite a bit relatively
speaking, then the object must be around
20 kilometers in diameter, and that&#39;s
the the 12 miles in diameter.
If on the other hand it&#39;s a comet in
which case the object would be
surrounded by a fuzzy coma with a much
smaller nucleus.
Uh however as he goes on to say both of
these natural explanations present
difficulties
in the first case because the prevalence
of interstellar objects of size 20
kilometers is it should be much lower.
Like if we look at this spectrum of
things that potentially pass through the
solar system near earth crossers collide
with the earth what we see is that it&#39;s
a it&#39;s an exponentially declining curve.
So that the reverse of that is that you
know here&#39;s here&#39;s your the smaller it
is the more the curve is up here and as
you go down and you get uh to the larger
and larger objects that curve
is is asymptoically
converging on zero.
Right? So what he&#39;s saying here is that
is that 20 kilometer object is going to
be extremely rare.
Uh there&#39;s not a lot of those.
or is this telling us there&#39;s more than
we thought? We don&#39;t know because let&#39;s
see. We did get the diameters of
Borisov. And actually, it&#39;s hard to say
diameter for for Ouamoas because it
looks more like a cigar. It&#39;s more like
a cylinder. Um
anyways, uh it says here that Muam Mua
was two orders of magnitude smaller than
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yep. This then implies the visit into
our solar system of Atlas should be an
exceedingly low probability event.
And the sec that&#39;s if it&#39;s an asteroid,
it&#39;s an exce if it&#39;s a 12 mile asteroid.
That&#39;s an exceedingly rare event.
But then again, it&#39;s kind of like
Shoemaker Levy nine. Who how do you
estimate the probabilities of something
if you only have one example to work
Right now in the second case where it&#39;s
referring to it if it&#39;s a comet there
has been to date absolutely no sign from
spectroscopic analysis of cometary
Such activity would imply a much smaller
nucleus and allow Atlas to be drawn from
a much larger interstellar population.
We await with anticipation further
observations of Atlas which should
clarify the situation.
The fuss observed around three eye atlas
is inconclusive given the motion of the
object and the inevitable smearing of
the image over the exposure time. Then
let&#39;s see if we look at the next one.
Yeah, there we go. So if we uh
right there we see how close uh the
closest approach to Venus 65 AU. So we
can simply all we have to do if we want
to calculate you listeners at home if
you got a calculator pull it out put in
93 million and just times it 65 and
you&#39;ll get uh
my light is poor here. you get about 6
million just over 6 million miles from
Venus and then Mars is very close 19 in
the cosmic sense
uh closest approach of Atlas and you&#39;ve
got the minimum possible closest
and Jupiter zero what is that suggesting
that it could potentially impact Jupiter
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s what it&#39;s suggesting it&#39;s within
margin of error
pertinent parameters concerning the
alignment of Atlas with Venus, Mars, and
Maximal possible. Okay. But zero, man.
How did they get that? I mean, isn&#39;t
that&#39;s implying that it would
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; potentially
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that it could actually
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if you had a 12 a 12mile
136,000 m per hour impact into Mars.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whoa. That would be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that would shake things up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My god, wouldn&#39;t it though? And there
it&#39;s showing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; minimum possible closest approach of
three I atlas 0.0000
to Mars.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The probability though is is very low
that it hits anything. It&#39;s just going
to zip through.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But there is a small chance I think is
what they&#39;re saying.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
A small but finite. Very very small.
Let&#39;s see in in fourth in table one we
find that atlas approaches particularly
close to Venus Mars and Jupiter during
its visit. In the following analysis, we
assume that three eye atlas is on its
current orbit
but vary the time of entry into the
solar system or equivalently the time of
perihelion.
Assuming three atlas could have come at
any time into the solar system and
happened to do so such that it came
within the observed closest approaches
of Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The
probability of this is 0.005%.
one part in 500 I believe right the
further we further assume that the
closest approach of threei atlas to the
planet is entirely a consequence of its
difference in heliocentric
longitude which basically just means
where if you if you think of that plane
extending out from the sun heliocentric
means centered on the sun um
and think of your longitude food on
Earth as being your east west way of
defining position. Uh that&#39;s all that
it&#39;s saying there. Uh
the sixth column on table two provides a
degree of misalignment in longitude
between the planet in question and the
interstellar object at its closest
The sixth column on table two. Oh, I
see. That&#39;s the one we were just looking
we&#39;ll skip the calculations for now. Um
so referring to the sixth row on table
one which is the optimal point to do a
solar o birth and stay bound to the sun.
Referring to the sixth row of table one,
we find a possible motivation since the
optimal breaking strategy is to stay
bound to the sun for high thrust
propulsion is a reverse solar oirth
where all the thrust is imparted at
perihelion.
Thus, any maneuvers of this kind would
be obscured from Earth observation,
allowing a surprise arrival on Earth to
be conducted. Oh, here he comes out and
he says what he&#39;s thinking.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
Wow. The seventh row of table one,
which maybe go back to the se go back to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m heading up there. Here we go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So the seventh row it says um
incoming radiant made it hard to detect
sooner. So what he&#39;s saying here and
this is interesting is that uh the
seventh row in table one reveals a
curious feature of three Atlas&#39;s
apparent direction of origin in that
Atlas&#39;s incoming radiant to the solar
system was from the direction of the
galactic center.
a particularly bright region which as
has been noted elsewhere made the object
particularly difficult to discern by
earth-based telescopes
in turn rendering it less conducive to
early detection.
The relevance of this is that had the
object indeed been discovered earlier,
then there would have been some
possibility that humanity could have
mounted an intercept mission, a recourse
that was out of the question by the time
three Atlas was actually detected.
Figure two shows the optimal intercept
trajectory for a mission to 31 Atlas
with optimal launch over a year ago.
So there&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we we missed it. There&#39;s an old
World War I saying, beware of the Hun
and the Sun
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is what the British pilots would say
because the Germans would uh would fly
as, you know, they would strategically
position themselves
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; above the Brits and then come come
flying out from apparently the sun. So
that&#39;s what uh he&#39;s he&#39;s inferring here.
This is a alien tactical strategy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uhhuh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s an interesting theory.
Color me skeptical, but it&#39;s
interesting.
So, this would have been the optimal
direct mission to intercept ThreeI
depart on July 19th
and intercept.
So it would have been a very very short
uh meeting with a 93.2
kilometer per second relative velocity.
You have one nancond to take your
photograph and do your scans.
But you would have gotten something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uhhuh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what do you think, Randall?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I&#39;m still
making up my mind.
So looking back at the at the uh table
the delta V needed to intercept Jupiter
is small. The delta V needed to
intercept Mars is small. Well, yeah,
we&#39;ve just determined that. Uh
so that&#39;s eight and nine on his list of
nine. Seven is Atlas&#39;s
uh incoming radiant
made it hard to detect sooner. I&#39;m still
going to have to look into this reverse
solar o birth. I want I want to know
about that. Um so he&#39;s got a conclusion
here. We strongly emphasize that this
paper is largely a pedagogical exercise
with interesting discoveries in strange
serendipities worthy of a rec record in
the scientific literature. By far the
most likely outcome is that or most
likely outcome will be that threeey
atlas is a completely natural
interstellar object probably a comet and
the authors await the astronomical data
to support this likely origin.
Nevertheless, when viewed with an open
mind or from an open mind and
unprejudiced perspective, these
investigations have revealed many
compelling insights into the possibility
that three atlas is technological and
more over the calculations presented
here are useful even in the interstellar
object or even if the interstellar
object ends up being a comet like two
Boris because they could be applied to
future detections of interstellar
objects by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
over the coming decade.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s interesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, it is uh there was more we could
talk about, but I think that we will uh
probably that&#39;s an a a good bit to to
understand and appreciate the anomalies
and the enigmas associated with this
thing. questions again. Are is this some
really rare exceptional event that will
only happen within the lifetime of human
beings, human beings, or is it going to
be uh something that&#39;s part of a new
normal where we see these objects flying
in from the cosmic deep? Who knows from
where and who knows where they&#39;re bound,
but they pass through our solar system.
The one thing I was wondering was
something on the order of 20 miles or or
12 miles in diameter. Would that have
the capability of
disrupting or dislodging
comets from the from the disc from the
either the because of the fact that it&#39;s
only 4 point something uh uh angular
uh inclination to the plane of the
ecliptic. Well, that means it&#39;s going to
be passing right through the the Kyper
disc over a pretty long distance.
Could it could the effect the long-term
effect be an object like this passing
through the the the the outer cometary
zone dislodge enough comets that it
could then trigger a cascading
infall of comets to the towards the sun
which could then lead to
could lead to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; all sorts of solarity.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. solar activity impacts on the
internal planets. Um, you know, this
brings us back to the torid meteor
stream that we&#39;ve talked about that
could be so important, uh, which appears
to have been very important to our past
and possibly again to our future and
deserves more in-depth discussion. Uh
we&#39;ve certainly touched on it, but it
would definitely warrant a more involved
uh examination
because I think the potential is there
for future impacts originating out of
the Torid meteor system.
Even though it&#39;s old and diffuse, it is
by no means exhausted.
And so, uh, I saw some comments online.
Somebody&#39;s saying we&#39;re gonna
potentially cross in 2032 with, but
yeah, we&#39;re going to cross the tor media
stream in 2032, but I got the impression
they didn&#39;t realize that we cross the
torid stream twice each year. And I
don&#39;t know why 2032 has been singled
out. Uh I don&#39;t think anybody has made a
prediction that there&#39;s something we&#39;re
going to encounter in that stream in
Uh now it could be that you know most of
the time when we pass the stream we&#39;re
going through areas where it&#39;s very low
density uh clustering of meteoritic
material. Um but there may be other
places where it&#39;s not so diffuse where
it may be much more concentrated. And if
we pass through the stream at that time
uh in its cycle then you know the
possibilities or probabilities of our
planet being struck increase by some
some order of magnitude. Um, and I think
that&#39;s kind of one of the contentions of
a number of scientists that have been
working on uh the effects and the
periodicities of impacts throughout the
history of the earth and possibly now
through the history of civilization on
Earth. And there is more and more
evidence acrewing that yeah, not only
have earth been pelted within the bigger
picture of things over millions, ten
millions of millions, but also over the
smaller scale from from decadal meaning
like within a 10year frame up to
centennial meaning uh 100 or millennial
meaning a thousand. And within that
framework of the human span of time,
um, yeah, there could very well be a lot
uh, impacts. But the point is is that
are impacts from things from space are
they just coming randomly
or are there what what uh Victor Clue
and William Napier I think in their
works refer to as an impact epoch or a
bombardment epoch
where the timing is such that we are
passing through meteor streams that have
clustered or clumped concentrated uh
areas and also meteor streams precess
just very much like the earth. So there
might be times when uh you know if we&#39;re
if you&#39;re tilted at an angle picture
here&#39;s here&#39;s the earth&#39;s equator. If
we&#39;re tilted in an angle and that&#39;s the
stream well you can see there that
there&#39;s that the that the intersection
time is short. However, as that angle
gets closer and closer to being um
juxtaposed right upon the plane of the
ecliptic, the more and more time those
objects are going to spend within the
zone of Earth&#39;s orbit. See? And if
meteor streams process precess
basically like this, which it looks like
they do, then there might be times when
the the me a meteor stream which is now
fairly well tilted to the earth&#39;s
orbital plane may be laying very
parallel to the earth&#39;s orbital plane.
While during a a period like that, the
the probabilities of impacts are going
to increase by some considerable amount.
So it&#39;d be worth talking about the
torreny and particularly because they do
sort of show up now as one of the prime
candidates for a multi-impact event at
the lower younger dest boundary.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We should do a a series on the mythology
behind the torids and the interesting
history that they have.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the mythos of man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the mythos of man. Oh yeah. Yeah. We
find it uh we find it in the you know
the kidnapping of Europa.
We find it in the slaying of the bull
and the mythraic mysteries.
We find it in Zoroastrianism.
I don&#39;t know about Christianity other
than the fact that you know the bull
symbolism was very prevalent in cultures
and civilizations
that existed during the time that the
spring equinox was passing through the
constellation of the bull
and then it subsequently passed from the
constellation of the bull to the
constellation of Aries and then you did
have a lot of ram symbolism like, you
know, new new kingdom of Egypt. You go
there to Luxor and you&#39;ve got those rows
of of uh sphinxes with ram&#39;s heads,
right? Um
and then so
uh then of course the vernal equinox
passed from the sign of the ram into the
sign of the fishes. And I think then we
begin to see the fish symbolism so
prevalent in in Christianity. And I
personally I believe the early
Christians were very sophisticated
astronomers
and had scientific knowledge. Uh that&#39;s
kind of been an overlooked part of the
study of early Christianity. I mean we
can talk about Egyptians having
astronomical knowledge. We can talk
about the megalithic builders of of
Stonehenge, Jane Berry of as having uh
astronomical knowledge. We can look at
uh the builders of the monumental
earthworks in North America and look at
examples like Newwork. Look at the
Mayans. We see this presence of
sophisticated
uh astronomical knowledge. Well, there&#39;s
not much conversation about the early
Christians, but I would suspect that
they did as well. And it showed up very
much so in the uh the building of the
Gothic cathedrals.
Uh and that kind of that archoastronomy
incorporated into the design of the the
Gothic cathedrals. these magnificent,
works of art and science together, which
to me is what makes them so profoundly
powerful is this perfect fusion of art
and philosophy and symbolism and and
science, which to me has showed me what
what I needed intellectually
to appreciate Christianity was that
there was this rational basis along with
the faith. Um
and and so once I discovered that I
begin to have a whole new appreciation
for Christianity and and uh I think now
when you bring up the bull symbolism you
know the the the the foremost competitor
to uh Christianity in the first century
AD was my Miththerism and the uh the
bull symbolism was right at the heart of
mythraic symbolism.
So, like you said, yeah, it would be
very interesting to look at some of that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;ll be fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, it&#39;ll be fun. I I Yeah, to me,
learning is fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Research is fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, uh yeah, I think this is probably a
good place to wrap up this episode. And,
uh we&#39;ll be reconvening very soon. Maybe
before the week is out, we&#39;ll be
recording another interview.
uh discussion. I&#39;m lining up some
interesting guests to bring on uh in the
next month or two and then uh we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; some real star power.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I did this
um I did a a sort of a tutorial
yesterday with the folks over at um
4 RBS 4 Res.
And they&#39;re using
uh in conjunction with restoring bee
health and the h uh the the uh the
robustness of the hive. And it&#39;s very
interesting stuff. I&#39;m just really on
the beginning of learning about it. And
uh we&#39;re going to record a whole episode
where they show me how they&#39;re using
these magnetic tools, not only just for
for bees, but for all kinds of things.
Now, I&#39;ve been using this uh you know, I
injured my foot earlier this year when I
took a tumble, and uh it&#39;s been very
slow to to fully get back full
functionality. What I&#39;ve been doing is
I&#39;ve been using this thing, setting it
on a a pillow on the floor and resting
my foot, my heel right on this
magnetism. And we&#39;re going to talk about
that because of the geometry in here.
But what was interesting is it&#39;s based
upon the uh the overlap of six circles
uh starting with a single circle, the
geometry of the hexagon, and then using
each corner of the hexagon to draw a
circle of equal radius. And that gives
you this flower of life symbol. But when
I did the interview with um Terrence
Howard, he showed me 3D models he had
where he was actually it was the same
intersection
of spheres as the circles that yield the
flower of life. And what that does is it
creates these zones of he called
negative uh uh what was it? negative um
well negative space and he built a model
of it. It&#39;s very very interesting. And
so coming right on the heels of that I
have this discussion with the uh the
people uh working on on on this and
discovering uh magnetism for forming
geometric patterns and the patterns seem
to affect the intensity of the magnetic
field. But I&#39;m going to be learning more
about that uh next week. I&#39;m going to
interview them. They&#39;re going to come
out square in the circle and then it&#39;ll
probably be a week or so, two weeks
after that by the time it gets cleaned
up and we put it out. But, uh, just to
let people know what&#39;s upcoming. And
then, uh, then November, the Azor&#39;s
we&#39;re going, uh, in search of Atlantis.
in search of Atlantis.
The word that we dare not speak because
if we do, we&#39;ll immediately be cast into
the outer zones of the fringe and
labeled as pseudocientist because only a
pseudocientist would even consider
uttering that word
um Atlantis.
Did it exist? I don&#39;t know. Could it
have? Yes, it could have. Based on what
Plato describes, it could have existed.
And I&#39;ve talked about that a lot and
we&#39;ll talk about that more. Um, now this
isn&#39;t sake because here&#39;s the thing.
People get bogged down in this advanced
civilization. What do we mean by that?
Well, are we talking about crystal ray
guns and flying machines and things like
that? No, not necessarily because he
doesn&#39;t say anything about that. Plato,
what we would be describing is
potentially a a very advanced, let&#39;s say
advanced advanced maritime or seafaring
culture, not unlike the Phoenicians or
the Manowans, but maybe,
you know, just more advanced from the
standpoint of not necessarily
technologically,
but to the level of of demographic or
geographic range. Um, you know, it
raises questions which I think are
certainly worthy of asking. Is it
possible that there have been seafaring
cultures that had circum possibly even
circumnavigated the globe that we&#39;ve
lost the record of. And we know for a
fact that islands were being colonized
50,000 years ago, which implies some
degree of seafaring capability, which
then in turn implies some astronomical
knowledge because that&#39;s the key thing
you need to know if you&#39;re going to
navigate uh around the oceans of the
world. Um right. So why is that such a
huge huge stretch to go okay well based
upon what Plato is describing? is
describing a seafaring culture that had
right? Um, that to me is not so
outlandish as now the fact that you have
factions that have turned it into a
subject of wooism or a subject of uh
pseudo speculation, if you want to call
it that, has served to give the
archaeological establishment ammunition
to essentially demolish or dismiss any
discussion at all. I mean, I&#39;ve seen
people online saying that, &#34;Oh, Rand
Carlson, he has no credibility. He
believes in Atlantis.&#34; I mean, almost
literal quote. I&#39;ve multiple times seen
variations on that. Well, you could. He
Yeah, don&#39;t pay any attention to him. He
believes in Atlantis, right?
Not exactly. It&#39;s a little more nuanced
than that, dude.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Straw men are a really, really easy
target for cowards.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. And that&#39;s what it is. That&#39;s what
it is. And it&#39;s just too bad that in
even within the professional circles we
have intellectual cowards.
Um and that&#39;s such something we should
talk about too. Um because there are
examples of uh yeah where where it&#39;s
clearly a coordinated uh assassination
attempt on people with unorthodox ideas.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Coordinated or even just an exercising
mob group think. Mhm. Mhm. Sure.
Well, all right. I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s
a good uh wrap up for now. And uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh I I want to encourage everybody go
check out Ground News. Uh and if you are
a researcher uh and you want to keep up
with current events, I don&#39;t think
you&#39;re going to do better than that. And
we will be continuing to use that as a
resource here at Square in the Circle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Been enjoying it. Really
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and enjoying it. Yeah. I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve had
fun with it. I really have. And I like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m glad they reached out as a sponsor.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Me too. Yeah, me too. Absolutely. I I
mean it was like I needed something like
that and I didn&#39;t know cuz I&#39;m like
there&#39;s just too much too much chaos
trying to navigate around all the
different sources on the internet to
find what you&#39;re looking for. So putting
this all in one place and then giving
you these tools, these filtering tools
and these tools to discern where it&#39;s
coming from and what the perspective is
amazingly helpful.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; check them out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Check them out. All right, John. Once
again, it&#39;s been fun.
See you again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You have a good night, sir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I will.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amu Mua Mua. Yeah. Mua.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. That&#39;s kind of like hunga hunga.
This is mua mua.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is Hawaiian. I feel like I&#39;m going to
be put out to pasture every time I try
to say it. So, forgive me native
speakers. Uh, but yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s
going to be something we stumble over.
And Boris, two Boris.
