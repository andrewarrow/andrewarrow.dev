Let&#39;s get to it. Megan Kelly uh had on
MTG uh for a far ranging discussion on
Israel. MTG reiterated that she thought
it was a genocide. But what I thought
was the most interesting was Megan Kelly
obviously becoming very uncomfortable
with the increasing amount of reach out
to her from the pro-Israel groups who
are desperate to get her to the state of
Israel on one of these propaganda trips.
Here&#39;s what she had to say. I have
absolutely no skin whatsoever in
defending any lobbyist group including
Apac. Right.
So I would love to know what they do
to get the loyalty of politicians
because I will say I have had multiple
multiple reachouts to me both from
friends and from connected people in DC
begging me to go to Israel with them.
And I have said no every time. I usually
I&#39;m just too busy. I have three kids.
cuz I have a full-time job. Like, sure,
I&#39;m not I&#39;m not doing it.
Um, but lately, it seems like it&#39;s
coming to be even more cuz I feel like
there&#39;s this there&#39;s a contingent of
people who are worried that they&#39;re
losing me.
And I&#39;ve said that you&#39;re not losing I&#39;m
not on Hamas&#39;s side.
No. God, no. Nobody&#39;s on Hamas&#39;s side.
But I It&#39;s been a while now that this
has been going on,
And we&#39;re getting more involved with the
Iranian bombing and so on.
Sure. And my own feelings are, you know,
I&#39;m I&#39;m looking at Israel in a different
way right now than I was on 108. That&#39;s
for sure. Of 23,
And I can feel the pressure being
slightly ratcheted up. Like you&#39;re not
allowed to. You&#39;re not allowed to.
And I can see people like you, like
Tucker, who I know I know Tucker. I&#39;ve
known him for years. And I&#39;ve seen you
in in your early career. I know you have
nothing against Israel.
Oh gosh, no. They
never mind Jews. That&#39;s all a lie. But
Right. And I see the beatdowns coming
like you&#39;re not allowed like you&#39;re you
have to stay right on this lily pad.
And you cannot jump to another
neighboring lily pad because it could
take you all the way down the river
M interesting. I mean I think that is so
by the way that has happened to me not
recently but uh in the in the beginning
days. Remember actually when that group
invited me to go to Israel and for to
view some 107 uh propaganda.
Oh yeah. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve told the
story in the show, but when I first
started at MSNBC, lo and behold, who
reaches out? Apac, you want to go to
Israel? Yeah. I mean, they, you know,
they Jamal Bowman talked about how he um
he didn&#39;t want to meet with them cuz he
knew what was what. And they went
through this like respected black men&#39;s
organization in New York to like
basically trick him or strongarm him
into to meeting with them, right? And I
mean, that&#39;s Yeah, that&#39;s what they do.
That&#39;s what they I I mean you got to
respect the game in some ways. They are
aggressive about cultivating anyone and
everyone and that&#39;s part of why they
have had such a lock on DC both parties
for so many years. But you know the the
interesting thing to me about Megan is
listen Megan shifts depending on the
vibe. Let&#39;s be honest. when it looked,
you know, in 2016 when it looked like
Trump was going down in flames. She&#39;s
very anti-Trump, right? She gets kicked
out of Fox.
Okay. Can I just say it was so funny
during the podcast where she&#39;s like,
&#34;Yeah, the media was saying all this
stuff about Trump in 2016.&#34; I was like,
&#34;The media, huh?&#34; I was like, &#34;Some of
us remember the first debate, man. I&#39;m
just saying.&#34;
Wasn&#39;t that was it about her that Trump
said the like blood coming out her eyes
and her everywhere?
Trump lore. The very first question of
the very first debate, the Rosie
O&#39;Donnell question.
Mr. Trump, you&#39;ve called women pigs. you
know, from Megan and he&#39;s like only
Rosie and American politics change
Yeah. So, she was like anti-Trump then
and then she kind of flirted with and
then she realized that if you&#39;re going
to be anyone in the Republican party,
you got to be tr pro Trump. Trump even
like called her out for it. Remember was
like she pretend she likes me now. She
didn&#39;t like me.
Yeah, she her career is based on
pretending. Anyway, it&#39;s all just to say
that she&#39;s looking where the winds are
blowing, right? and the winds are
blowing in an anti-Israel direction
right now. And so you see her
repositioning. And that&#39;s, you know, I
found it interesting when Piers Morgan
did it because he also is another one
that, you know, is noting. He&#39;s look,
he&#39;s a tabloid guy. He&#39;s got his sense
of like where the the public is and
where they&#39;re shifting to, etc. I
thought he was a noteworthy one. Um
certainly I mean the public
Israel is only supported basically by
older Republicans at this point. That&#39;s
right. The rep the Rep Republican party
overall is the most pro-Israel. No
doubt. They&#39;ve lost independence.
They&#39;ve completely lost Democrats. It&#39;s
basically only support in the Republican
party. But even there, especially if
you&#39;re in a podcast space online, you&#39;re
going to have a hard time if you are
lock step with them. The real reason I
wanted to play that clip is cuz I&#39;m
going to provide people with an update
on that Israeli the case of the Israeli
government official caught up in the
People need to know this. Conservative
media has not touched it once. Not one
mention on Fox News, not one mention on
uh the Ben Shapiro show or anyone over
at the Daily Wire. Not one single
mention by anyone over at the Daily
Wire. Let&#39;s let&#39;s make clear uh a lot
look a lot of my old colleagues and
friends who are working in the
industrial complex have written zero
stories done zero reporting. Now look
you know I I I should try to toot my own
horn and be like oh it was a masterful
work of journalism to get my scoop. It
wasn&#39;t okay. Here&#39;s the truth. I just
did the basic leg work. It took me a
long time. I had to get on the phone,
email some people, you know, whatever
and eventually convince the source to
provide me with documents. It&#39;s not that
hard. anybody at the New York Times or
the Daily Wire or at Fox News. Fox News
could have had it way before me. You
know why? They have somebody who works
for them in Vegas. All they would have
had to do is drive over to the
courthouse and talk to somebody in
person. If I&#39;d lived in Vegas, I could
have had that story in 30 minutes. It&#39;s
only because I&#39;m, you know, 2,000 miles
away or whatever. So, just so everybody
understands that is the purpose of the
donor control over the conservative
media industrial complex. Now, what I
think Megan is because at the end of the
day, Megan is independent. She she
finances I believe entirely by herself.
I mean she&#39;s very rich obviously uh for
her from her own uh past career in cable
news. She&#39;s probably looking at that and
also uncomfort of man I&#39;m getting a it&#39;s
like and she even said this the more
that you tell me I can&#39;t say something
I&#39;m going to look into it. And that has
happened more and more and more and
increasingly you&#39;re watching like the
world shrink for the pro-Israel side
where yes they still have quite a lot of
control over the media but with social
media with YouTube with everything else
their ability to control that narrative
is just falling apart. So I do think
it&#39;s important
for her to say what she said. I will
also say the amount of push back
unbelievable. Everyone&#39;s already like
she&#39;s going down the Tucker Carlson
path. she had on platform.
MG. Yeah. Tuckerlson.
MTG. The idiot brain deadad MTG is
coming on, you know, coming on with her
nonsense. And already it&#39;s like the
concern trolling. If you go on Twitter
and you look at her replies, oh my god,
like to her that episode with MTG, it&#39;s
a fullblown panic for her just having
her on and even saying the things that
she just did. So, she&#39;s still on the
team for now because she&#39;s still blaming
Hamas for starvation, etc. But I I
wouldn&#39;t be surprised six months from
now if we see something different.
The other thing is the um you know the
the apac types they you can&#39;t diverge
even I mean that&#39;s actually what saying
you can&#39;t you can&#39;t diverge an inch. So
once you do once you&#39;re off the island
then it&#39;s like oh okay well that you
know you can say whatever you want
because you&#39;re already dead to them
effectively. Um, which I don&#39;t know why
so many Democratic politicians in
particular don&#39;t realize that that
there&#39;s there&#39;s no middle ground on
this. There&#39;s no middle ground on a
genocide. There&#39;s no middle ground on
these horrors. Like you&#39;re in or you&#39;re
out. You&#39;re in favor of babies being
bombed or you&#39;re not. Um the the MTG had
a very um you know interesting and you
know I thought quite extraordinary post
the other day talking about there were
two you know two important decisions
made by this administration with regard
to children recently. One was to block
Palestinian children who have their arms
and legs blown off by frequently our
bombs um from coming and seeking medical
care and another one that allowed this
alleged Israeli pedophile to fly home
and um you know potentially escape
justice. So um she was calling that out
directly. I also think there&#39;s some of
what&#39;s going on here too is uh among MTG
and others is a recognition that the
Trump era is not going to last forever.
that, you know, he at some point is
going to be out of public life. Um,
departed in one way or another and some
positioning for what that is going to
look like afterwards, I think is part of
what is going on here as well. But, you
know, on the like betrayal of the idea
of America first, we could put D3 up on
the screen here. This is the latest that
we&#39;ve got of um people&#39;s social media is
going to be screened for anti-semitic,
quote unquote, anti-semitic activity.
Um, so this is, you know, the part of
the crackdown is you&#39;re going to if you
if you want to come to this country at
all, then you have to make sure that you
have all the right views on Israel or
else you&#39;re going to be blocked. So
there you go.
Yep. It&#39;s uh very important for people
to see what&#39;s going on. And I do think
that her comments though are a harbinger
of the Overton window is slowly breaking
open. And the more people see like
Israel first amongst a lot of the
conservative like intelligencia and
specifically a lot of the media class, I
think that they will continue to lose
credibility. It&#39;s a long game, don&#39;t get
me wrong. It&#39;s not going to change
immediately. Hey, if you like that
