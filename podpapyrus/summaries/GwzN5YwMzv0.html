one of the biggest mysteries of our
existence is also one of the biggest
mysteries of physics time
we experience time as passing with a
special moment that we call now
now you&#39;re watching this video half an
hour ago you were doing something else
whatever you did there&#39;s no way to
change it and what you will do in half
an hour is up to you
at least that&#39;s how we perceive time but
what physics tells us about time is very
different from our perception
the person who figured this out was none
other than albert einstein
i know that guy again turns out he kind
of knew it all
what did einstein teach us about the
past the present and the future
that&#39;s what we&#39;ll talk about today
the topic we&#39;re talking about today is
covered in more detail in my new book
existential physics which will be
published in august you find more info
about the book at
existentialphysics.com
we think about time as something that
works the same for everyone and every
object if one second passes for me one
second passes for you and one second
passes for the clouds above
this makes time a universal parameter
this parameter labels how much time
passes and also what we all mean by now
herman minkowski was the first to notice
that this may not be quite right
he noticed that maxwell&#39;s equations of
electrodynamics make much more sense if
one treats time as a dimension not as a
just like a ball doesn&#39;t change if you
rotate one direction of space into
another maxwell&#39;s equations don&#39;t change
if you rotate one direction of space
into time
so minkowski said we just combine space
with time to a four dimensional space
time and then we can rotate space into
time just like we can rotate two
directions of space into each other
and that naturally explains why
maxwell&#39;s equations have the symmetry
they do have
it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with
electric and magnetic fields it comes
from the properties of space and time
themselves i can&#39;t draw a flower let
alone four dimensions but i can just
about manage two straight lines one for
time and the other for at least one
dimension of space
this is called a space-time diagram
if you just stand still then your motion
in such a diagram is a straight vertical
line if you move at a constant velocity
your motion is a straight line tilts it
at some angle
so if you change velocity you rotate in
space time the maximal velocity at which
you can move is the speed of light which
by convention is usually drawn at a 45
degree angle in space we can go forward
backward left right or up and down in
time we can only go forward we can&#39;t
make a u-turn and there aren&#39;t any
driveways for awkward three-point turns
so time is still different from space in
some respects but now that time is also
a dimension it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s just a
label for coordinates there&#39;s nothing
universal about it there are many ways
to put labels on a two-dimensional space
because you can choose your axes as you
want the same is the case now in
space-time
once you have made time into a dimension
the labels on it don&#39;t mean much
so what then is the time that we talk
about what does it even mean that time
is the dimension do other dimensions
exist supernatural ones that could
explain the strange sounds you&#39;ve been
hearing at night
no that&#39;s a separate problem i&#39;m afraid
i can&#39;t help you with it was albert
einstein who understood what this means
if we also want to understand that we
need four assumptions the speed of light
in vacuum is finite it&#39;s always the same
nothing can go faster than the speed of
light and all observer&#39;s viewpoints are
equally valid
this formed the basis of einstein&#39;s
theory of special relativity
oh and also the observers don&#39;t have to
exist i mean this is theoretical physics
so we&#39;re talking about theoretical
observers basically
so if there could be an observer with a
certain viewpoint then that viewpoint is
equally valid as yours who or what is an
observer is an ant an observer a tree
how about a dolphin
what do you need to observe to deserve
being called an observer and what do you
have to observe with
believe it or not there&#39;s actually quite
some discussion about this in the
scientific literature
we&#39;ll sidestep this
interesting discussion and use the word
observer the same way that einstein did
which is a coordinate system
you see it&#39;s a coordinate system that
the theoretical observer might use
dolphin or otherwise
yeah maybe not exactly what the fbi
thinks an observer is but then if it was
good enough for einstein it&#39;ll be good
enough for us
so einstein&#39;s assumption basically means
any coordinate system should be as good
as any other for describing physical
reality these four assumptions sound
rather innocent at first but they have
profound consequences let&#39;s start with
the first and third
the speed of light is finite and nothing
goes faster than light
you&#39;re probably watching this video on a
screen a phone or laptop is the screen
there now unless you&#39;re from the future
watching this video as a hologram in
your space house i&#39;m going to assume the
answer is yes
but a physicist might point out that
actually you don&#39;t know
because the light that&#39;s emitted from
the screen now hasn&#39;t reached you yet
also if you are from the future of
watching this as a hologram make sure to
look at me from the right it&#39;s my good
side maybe you hold the phone in your
hand but nerve signals are ridiculously
slow compared to light
if you couldn&#39;t see your hand and
someone snatch your phone it&#39;ll take
several microseconds for the information
that the phone is gone to even arrive in
your brain
so how do you know your phone is there
one way to answer this question is to
say well you don&#39;t know and really you
don&#39;t know that anything exists now
other than your own thoughts
i think therefore i am as descartes
sumpted up
this isn&#39;t wrong i come back to this
later but it&#39;s not how normal people use
the word now
we talk about things that happen now all
the time and we never worry about how
long it takes for light to travel
why can&#39;t we just agree on some now and
get on with it i mean think back of that
space-time diagram clearly this flat
line is now so let&#39;s just agree on this
and move on okay but if this is to be
physics rather than just a diagram you
have to come up with an operational
procedure to determine what we mean by
now you have to find a way to measure it
einstein did just that in what he called
the dump experiment a thought experiment
he said suppose you place a mirror to
your right and one to your left you and
the mirrors are at a fixed distance to
each other so in the space-time diagram
it looks like this
you send one photo left and one right
and make sure that both photons leave
you at the same time
then you wait to see whether the photons
come back at the same time if they don&#39;t
you adjust your position until they do
now remember einstein&#39;s second
assumption the speed of light is always
the same
this means if you can send photons to
both mirrors and they come back at the
same time then you must be exactly in
the middle between the mirrors
the final step is then to say that at
exactly half the time it takes for the
photons to return you know they must be
bouncing off the mirror
you could say
now at the right moment even though the
light from there hasn&#39;t reached you yet
it looks like you&#39;ve found a way to
construct now but here&#39;s the problem
suppose you have a friend who flies by
at some constant velocity maybe in a
spaceship her name is alice she&#39;s much
cooler than you and you have no idea why
she&#39;s agreed to be friends with you but
here she is speeding by in her spaceship
left to right
as we saw earlier in your space-time
diagram alice moves on a tilted straight
she does the exact same thing as you
places mirrors to both sides sends
photons and waits for them to come back
and then says when half the time has
passed that&#39;s the moment the photons hit
the mirrors
except that this clearly isn&#39;t right
from your point of view because the
mirrors to her right are in the
direction of her flight
so the light takes longer to gather than
it does to the mirrors on the left which
move towards the light
you would say that the photon which goes
left clearly hits the mirror first
because the mirror is coming at it from
your perspective she just doesn&#39;t notice
because when the photons go back to
alice the exact opposite happens the
photon coming from the left takes longer
to get back so the net effect cancels
what ellis says happens now is clearly
not what you think happens now
for alice on the other hand
you are the one moving relative to her
and she thinks that her notion of now is
right and yours is wrong
so who&#39;s right
probably alice you might say because
she&#39;s much cooler than you she owns a
spaceship after all
maybe but let&#39;s ask einstein here is
where einstein&#39;s fourth assumption comes
in the viewpoints of all observers are
equally valid
so you&#39;re both right
or to put it differently the notion of
now depends on the observer it is
observer dependent as physicists say
you&#39;re now is not the same as my now
if you like technical terms this is also
called the relativity of simultaneity
these mismatches in what different
observers think happens now are
extremely tiny in everyday life
they only become noticeable when
relative velocities are close to the
speed of light so we don&#39;t normally
notice them
if you and i talk about who knocked at
the door right now we won&#39;t
misunderstand each other if we&#39;d zipped
around with nearly the speed of light
however referring to now would get very
confusing this is pretty mind-bending
already but wait it gets wider
let us have a look at the space-time
diagrams again now let us take any two
events that are not causally connected
this just means that if you wanted to
send a signal from one to the other the
signal would have to go faster than
light so signaling from one to the other
isn&#39;t possible
diagram diagrammatically this means if
you connect the two events the line has
an angle less than 45 degrees to the
horizontal the previous construction
with the mirrors shows that for any two
such events there is always some
observer for whom those two events
happen at the same time
you just have to imagine the mirrors fly
through the events and the observer
flies through directly in the middle
and then you adjust the velocity until
the photons hit both events at the same
time okay so any two causally
disconnected events happen
simultaneously for some observer
now take any two events that are
causally connected like eating too much
cheese for dinner and then feeling
terrible the morning after
find some event that isn&#39;t causally
connected to either let&#39;s say this event
is a supernova going off in a distant
there then always observers for whom the
supernova and your cheese dinner are
simultaneous and there are observers for
whom the supernova and your morning
after are simultaneous
let&#39;s then put all those together
if you&#39;re comfortable with saying that
something anything exists now which
isn&#39;t here
then according to einstein&#39;s fourth
assumption this must be the case for all
but if all the events that you think
happen now exist and all other observers
say that the events that happen at the
same time as those events exist
then all events exist now
another way to put this is that all
times exist in the same way this is
called the block universe it&#39;s just
there it doesn&#39;t come into being it
doesn&#39;t change it just sits there if you
find that somewhat hard to accept there
is another possibility to consistently
combine a notion of existence with
einstein&#39;s special relativity
all that i just said came from assuming
that you&#39;re willing to say something
exists now even though you can&#39;t see or
experience it in any way
if you&#39;re willing to say that only
things exist which are now end here
then you don&#39;t get a block universe
but maybe that&#39;s even more difficult to
another option is to simply invent a
notion of existence and define it to be
a particular slice and space time for
each moment in time
this is called a slicing but
unfortunately it has nothing to do with
pisa if it had any observable
consequences that would contradict the
fourth assumption that einstein made so
it&#39;s in conflict with special relativity
and since this theory is experimentally
extremely well confirmed this would
almost certainly mean the idea is in
conflict with observation but if you
just want to define a noun that doesn&#39;t
have observable consequences you can do
though i&#39;m not sure why you would want
to quantum mechanics doesn&#39;t change
anything about the block universe
because it&#39;s still compatible with
special relativity
the measurement update of the wave
function which i talked about in this
earlier video happens faster than the
speed of light
if it could be observed you could use it
to define a notion of simultaneity but
it can&#39;t be observed so there&#39;s no
contradiction
some people have argued that since
quantum mechanics is indeterministic the
future can&#39;t already exist in the block
universe and that therefore there must
also be a special moment of now
that divides the past from the future
and maybe that is so but even if that
was the case the previous argument still
applies to the past
so yeah it&#39;s true for we currently know
the past exists the same way as the
so you thought this is a video about
special relativity but then i&#39;ve been
talking about quantum mechanics again
indeed i now have an entire course about
quantum mechanics up at brilliant which
accompanies my videos on the topic
brilliant is an amazing tool for
learning with courses on a large variety
of topics in science and mathematics
our new course will give you an
introduction to superpositions and
entanglement the uncertainty principle
non-commutativity
and bell&#39;s theorem
