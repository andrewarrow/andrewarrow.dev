          <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
            <div class="text-blue-50"><p>A podcast interview featuring <strong>Maddie Prewett Trout</strong> and her husband <strong>Grant Trout</strong> on the <em>Unplanned</em> podcast. They discuss their journey as new parents to 6-month-old Hosanna, sharing humorous stories about traveling with a baby and the challenges of early parenthood.</p>

<p>The couple met on a <strong>blind date</strong> in December and had a whirlwind romance - getting <strong>engaged after 7 months</strong> and married just <strong>3 months later</strong>. On their first date, Maddie texted her mom saying she would marry Grant after just one hour together.</p>

<p>Grant comes from significant wealth as the son of billionaire Kenny Trout, who sold his company for over $3 billion. Grant discusses how people often make assumptions about him due to his family's wealth, but emphasizes his focus on serving others and living humbly. His father's story includes going from <em>homelessness to billionaire status</em>, eventually finding faith after realizing money didn't bring fulfillment.</p>

<p>The interview touches on <strong>Maddie's experience on The Bachelor</strong>, which she describes as traumatic, leading to significant weight loss. Grant has never watched her season, preferring to know "this Maddie" rather than her past relationships. They briefly broke up for 12 hours during their dating period but reconciled after watching the movie <em>Redeeming Love</em> with her family.</p>

<p>The couple emphasizes their approach to <strong>giving and service</strong>, balancing financial generosity with hands-on volunteering. They discuss the importance of community, wise counsel, and finding purpose beyond material success. Maddie has a new book titled <em>"Dare to Be True"</em> coming out, while Grant has taken a year-long break from social media.</p>

You guys got engaged 7 months after you
met and then
three-month engagement.
Three-month engagement. So within 10
months, you were married. Yeah. This
wasn&#39;t the first time that you were
engaged, right?
Wasn&#39;t there?
I&#39;d never been engaged.
Oh, there wasn&#39;t. Did I get that wrong?
I was like, tell me more, brother.
He has not seen any part of the
You&#39;ve never seen any of the episodes. I
want to know this Maddie right here. I
don&#39;t think she&#39;d want to go see my
ex-girlfriend moments.
We ended the same day I was going to
meet her family. She told everybody. So,
I&#39;m meeting everybody like, &#34;Hey, mama.&#34;
And they&#39;re looking at you like, &#34;Who&#39;s
this? Who&#39;s this a-hole that just broke
up with? My sweet girl. Today on
Unplanned, we sat down with Mattie Puit
Trout and her husband Grant Trout. You
probably already know Maddie from her
time on The Bachelor, but she didn&#39;t
meet her husband on the show. She ended
up meeting him on a blind date. Grant is
the son of billionaire Kenny Trout, who
sold his company for over $3 billion. We
talk about Maddie and Grant&#39;s love
story, why they broke up, and what Grant
learned from his billionaire father, all
on today&#39;s episode.
Maddie Puit Trout and Grant Trout,
welcome to the podcast. So good to be
for being here. Welcome to Unplanned.
Thanks for having us.
Of course, you guys are new parents.
Tell me about how that&#39;s been.
Let&#39;s jump straight into it.
Parenting.
Parenting. Uh
literally the best thing in the world.
She&#39;s 6 months now. I feel like that&#39;s a
big milestone.
She&#39;s become her own personality. Little
personality,
which is wild.
She hasn&#39;t started crawling forward yet,
but she&#39;s learned how to push herself
back and scoot herself back. So, we&#39;re
making progress. She&#39;s sleeping through
the night now.
Praise go.
That was a big praise.
Were y&#39;all&#39;s kids early on that or like
later in the game?
It depended on the kid. Really? I think
discourage you, but
No, no, no. I don&#39;t want to discourage
you, but
please don&#39;t discourage me cuz we&#39;re
just now hitting.
No, no. I mean, tell us. Tell us.
No, I&#39;m not going to say.
She&#39;s like, we regress.
Did they start? Did they go back?
I mean, yeah. There&#39;s Well, our worst
sleeper is our three-year-old, but I&#39;m
not even going to I Here&#39;s the thing.
Here&#39;s the thing. Everyone has their own
kids, their own journey. They&#39;re all
No, it&#39;s true. I have friends who legit
like their baby out of the womb, slept
through basically almost through the
night and like woke up one time to feed
and I&#39;m like our second K was like that.
Recently, we were able to get him and
his brother to sleep in the same room
cuz they just feel like buddies and like
sleep. Sweet. Um but then like literally
just a couple days ago, he started
waking up in the night again. So we&#39;ve
been co-sleeping with him again. So it&#39;s
just like it&#39;s it&#39;s a whole process.
Parenthood has taught me anything. as
soon as we get comfortable,
they just really like
don&#39;t don&#39;t get comfortable.
Don&#39;t get comfortable.
Just be ready.
And I&#39;m also like, man, I really should
just be careful what I say because
there&#39;s been so many times I&#39;ve been
like, man, through that tunnel and then
we&#39;re just like,
oh, oh, here we are.
And now there&#39;s another tunnel. We&#39;re
back here.
We made another one.
But you know what? That&#39;s a huge
milestone. I feel like you should be
pretty good for get some sleep now.
When you say sleeping through the night,
like are we talking 9 hours, 12 hours?
Like what does that mean? What is she?
She&#39;s seven. She&#39;s seven to seven right
Seven to seven.
Oh, that&#39;s amazing. Massive for the
It is huge. But then we get time after
we put her down and it&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, this
is so nice to get to connect just the
two of us.&#34; And then, yeah, wake up
early in the morning, get a little bit
of quiet time and, you know, start the
day. It&#39;s been really good. And she&#39;s in
her own room now.
She&#39;s like getting sassy right now. I
don&#39;t know. It&#39;s starting to come out.
Yeah. She&#39;s She&#39;ll have this like push
She&#39;ll poke her lips out.
Yeah. And I&#39;m like, hosana, it is super
cute, man.
She rolls over. She&#39;s sleep in her own
crib. Uh,
man, she&#39;s tra she&#39;s been to 10 states,
I think. Really? So, she&#39;s just like
along for the ride, which has been fun.
She honestly does so good. Like, she&#39;ll
even like sleep through the night in
like a hotel room where like lights
coming in like her whole sleep
environment&#39;s, you know, thrown off a
We were We were on We were coming back
from Montana like two days ago and she
killed Montana to Dallas.
She crushed it.
Killed it. But then we sat in Dallas to
go to Nashville for like
long and the flight had no air
conditioning
except for the fact that she well on the
way there she had a blowout and pooped
all over me.
Matty&#39;s pants fully yellowed in poop on
the plane for like I didn&#39;t bring an
extra pair of clothes. I brought her an
extra pair of clothes cuz I certainly
blow outs are going to happen.
But me wasn&#39;t prepared to be pooped all
over. So I was covered in poop.
You had plain poop situations. We had
plain puke situations. one time. Those
will those will get real.
I was I was sticking to
Abby was a saint. She literally went
into the the bathroom on the plane, that
teeny little bathroom, and scrubbed out
the poo from the onesie with soap and
water cuz like to not have a
because we were extra set of clothes.
The airport that we were flying into was
outdoors. We had to walk off the plane
and it was cold. We&#39;re like, we can&#39;t
have our baby. This was into I think
It was
Montana flight. Don&#39;t go to Montana or
else you&#39;ll be covered.
Uh what what&#39;s the the name of that?
That was also when I got puked on was
going to Montana.
Yeah, it&#39;s always Montana.
You guys entire family got sick in
Montana. Everyone was throwing up. I got
puked on too. Wait, yeah, we both got
puked on in Montana.
Oh, no.
So many casualties.
Yeah, that&#39;s parenting is humbling.
Humbling is humbling, man.
Feel like it it&#39;s like great for
character development. Like you made you
a better person being a parent. Like has
it like taught you selflessness in a way
that you didn&#39;t understand before? Yeah,
And it&#39;s definitely revealed like I
think selfishness too, like where we&#39;re,
you know, just prone to want your own
way or like you have your set of
expectations of how you want the day to
go, but then it&#39;s like there&#39;s going to
be some unexpected twists and turns
that, you know, you didn&#39;t see coming.
But I would say truly, it&#39;s just been
like the best thing ever. Like I would
say for me as a mom, I feel like I&#39;ve
stepped into a level of purpose that I
just didn&#39;t even know was possible. I&#39;m
so blessed to say like I feel like I&#39;m
living out my purpose, but stepping into
motherhood was like a whole new level of
that. And it&#39;s just been like the
greatest gift. And then getting to see
your person that you love like be a
parent is
the sweetest thing.
She like stepped into it flawlessly. I
feel like I&#39;m struggling a little bit. I
don&#39;t know how you were with your kids
when they can&#39;t talk back. So she feeds
her. She does all the things. And I&#39;m
like I love Hosanna so much, but it&#39;s
also so different for the dad at the
start. And I&#39;m like early on the biggest
struggle was like I would get her when
she&#39;s crying or to change her diaper and
I&#39;m like okay she&#39;s so sweet with
Maddie. Maddie feeds her. They have
these deep moment. Okay Grant take her
change her. Is that was that your
experience? Like it&#39;s funny you say that
because I&#39;ve talked to so many dads
about this. And I luckily have gotten to
the point now where I have a
three-year-old and almost 2-year-old and
we have full-on conversations. Totally.
And we will laugh together to a point
where like I can&#39;t even breathe. them.
It&#39;s going to change the game, the
So, if you&#39;re finding any enjoyment in
the newborn stage, like just wait. Like,
it gets it gets to be so much fun.
Now, I I really understand where this
like pure love for parenting comes from
because like I&#39;m in it and I never want
it to end. Like, I I never want the the
joy on my son&#39;s face when I come out of
my office and he sees me and he&#39;s like
he just thinks I&#39;m like a superhero. You
would think it&#39;s been like a month.
It&#39;s like
and it just No, there&#39;s nothing like
It&#39;s the best. And it&#39;s hard to see that
when you&#39;re in the newborn stage and
you&#39;re waking up four or five times the
I feel like it&#39;s those early months that
like create the foundation of like why
it just keeps getting better though cuz
you&#39;re like we have this history bond.
We were up all night together. Like we
cried together like we were crying, mom
was crying, daddy was crying, everybody
was crying. I was in the corner crying,
the tears, so many.
You mentioned it being tough in the
beginning. What&#39;s been a moment for you
that you had to like really dig down
deep and push through, man. Uh her third
day of life, little girl just born.
She&#39;s not she didn&#39;t poop for like pee
or poop for 36 hours. And so, you know,
if y&#39;all go back to your first baby,
everything is so serious. Well, first
off, we&#39;re leaving the hospital. It&#39;s
11°. So, we&#39;re like bundling.
It&#39;s freezing outside. This is January.
It&#39;s January 20th. We come out and y&#39;all
know that moment when you&#39;re leaving the
hospital for the first time. You&#39;re just
like, &#34;Come out. My car won&#39;t start.&#34;
Oh god.
And he had had so many car issues and I
had this feeling you guys. I said,
I think we need to get a new car. Like I
have this it&#39;ll start the car like on
the way to the hospital or coming home
from the hospital.&#34; And he&#39;s like,
&#34;We&#39;ll be fine.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Should we
take my car?&#34; And he&#39;s like, &#34;We&#39;ll be
fine. The car doesn&#39;t start.&#34;
So the car&#39;s dead. It&#39;s freezing.
And we&#39;ve like loaded the car with
everything. We&#39;re literally
the car seat&#39;s in there perfectly. You
don&#39;t know how you get it all right. So
then we&#39;re like, &#34;Oh my gosh.&#34; And she&#39;s
like getting nauseous. She&#39;s weak. We&#39;re
calling her mom. And luckily her mom was
in town. Came and got us. So already it
feels like, &#34;Oh, we&#39;re like a little
spinning. Like this is hard. Go home.&#34;
But she won&#39;t she won&#39;t go to the
bathroom. It&#39;s been a day and a half.
And then the doctor&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, I guess
she&#39;s not eating.&#34; So we were afraid
that she wasn&#39;t taking Mattiey&#39;s breast
milk. And it was just a really hard
moment where you realize, &#34;I am so
dependent. I&#39;m not in control.&#34; And
luckily a girl came over who gave her
breast milk or someone else.
Some frozen donated breast milk from
like some of her friends. Like it
essentially felt like the picture of
like the church coming together and
helping you when you&#39;re in community and
just like community because we&#39;re
sitting here like I don&#39;t know what to
do. Like I&#39;m feeding my daughter. I
guess she&#39;s not getting enough milk cuz
she&#39;s not going to the bathroom. You
know, you feel that pressure of like
they have to get back up to their birth
weight and all these things. And you
know, they&#39;re supposed to like have as
many however many like wet diapers and
poops or whatever. And I&#39;m like, she
hasn&#39;t peed or pooped in over 36 hours.
So, we&#39;re just like freaking out. I&#39;m
having a breakdown. I&#39;m coming off all
my hormones. Oh, dude.
Then I&#39;m like having a breakdown. I&#39;m
like, I don&#39;t know. Like, what are we
And you haven&#39;t slept in like no
3 days. So, you&#39;re trying to like think
and have y&#39;all like I just remember
being the smallest things felt so hard.
It was like take out the trash. I&#39;m like
I don&#39;t even know how to like start
because I haven&#39;t slept. And so it&#39;s
just like but then luckily she went to
the bathroom after that. Just moments
where we were like this is new hard and
it&#39;s vulnerable because you&#39;re now in
control and in charge of this baby.
Scammers are getting way too good in
2025 especially with AI. Like recently
I&#39;ve been getting text messages all the
time about unpaid tolls when I know that
I don&#39;t have tolls that I need to pay.
It&#39;s it&#39;s actually just a scam. I&#39;ve
been posting about it on my Instagram
story and a lot of people have been
experiencing this same scam as well.
Yeah, I get those with like undelivered
packages, too. They&#39;re like you need to
pay to get your package delivered.

I remember the first time I left the
hospital room and we looked around like
but who&#39;s in charge of this? Like us?
Like this is ours. And uh and then
different moments where I would say like
you just aren&#39;t sleeping and when the
baby&#39;s screaming as a dad you want to
fix and you can&#39;t fix
cuz I think she probably had a little
bit of collic and she wasn&#39;t sleeping
well at night. She struggled with
sleeping. So, it was a lot of screaming
early on. Like now she&#39;s such an
incredible sweet little baby girl, but
and she has her sassy moments, but she
at first I feel like really struggled
being outside of the womb. She&#39;s like,
&#34;Wait, I really liked the womb, you
know, what am I doing here?&#34; It was a
big adjustment. So, it was it was hard.
Like, we&#39;re not getting sleep. She&#39;s
struggling sleeping, you know,
screaming, crying. Um, and you&#39;re just
adjusting to a new life with a with a
baby and trying to figure out all the
things. So, it was, you know, a lot of
of asking community to pray and just
having people come around us asking
honestly like texting a lot of moms and
being like, &#34;Hey, what did you do? How
did you do this?&#34; Um, and really like
turning to community and not trying to
figure it out yourself, I think was
honestly so huge for us. Um, I think
it&#39;s so easy to just like try and, you
know, like muster up the strength and
figure it all out on your own.
Oh, sorry to interrupt. Did you figure
out any hacks or tricks? Like I know for
us, I would literally take out my phone
and put play this shushing sound from a
like a a sleep sound app that I
downloaded for free and the the shushing
would help. And you know, I just like
play the the sh over and over and over.
Like did you have anything like that
that would help if your if your baby
wouldn&#39;t sleep?
Yeah, we had all that the hatch. Uh
y&#39;all mess with the hatch that
we had the hatch. We had I mean honestly
she was so like honestly just wanted to
be held all the time. Now we&#39;re in the
stage where the happy song is really
big. Have you heard about the the happy
What is the happy? You haven&#39;t heard the
happy song,
you guys. Well, she does not like the
car. So, you know, everybody&#39;s like,
&#34;Oh, they get in the car, they fall
asleep in the car.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;No, it&#39;s
not our story.&#34; She gets in the car, she
starts screaming in the car. So, the
happy song changed her life. So, that&#39;s
been one of our hacks for all you
listeners.
Literally midscream, she hears this beat
come on and it&#39;s she&#39;s quiet.
She stops crying. Amazing.
It&#39;s unbelievable.
Whatever they put in that song,
I don&#39;t know what it Listen, I don&#39;t
know what&#39;s in that song. I hope it&#39;s
okay. It&#39;s funny.
Yeah, I got to check it out.
We got to check it out.
Got to check it out.
Yeah. You haven&#39;t heard of it? I haven&#39;t
heard that.
I feel like I might have heard of it,
but maybe I don&#39;t know. Like,
we probably could sing it for you right
now because we
really I know everyone. Would you Would
you please do the honors of singing it?
Um, it&#39;s like uh
it&#39;s this beat that starts and then it&#39;s
like a baby noise.
Little monkey.
you got to go listen to it. Don&#39;t make
us do this.
It&#39;s got all these different sounds.
Check it out. Yeah, y&#39;all got to check
it out, man. You&#39;re missing out, man. I
feel like I am. You&#39;re missing out in
the car. It&#39;s for the adults, too. I&#39;m
going to go like it on Spotify and
Stitch and the Hot Wheels theme song.
Hot Wheels and Hot Wheels. Let&#39;s bring
that good boy life.
My favorite one though is there&#39;s like
the spooky song. The boys are always
like, &#34;Dad, spooky song. Dad, spooky
song.&#34; And so there&#39;s this uh this
track. It&#39;s not even like an actual
song. It&#39;s just like some background
track in the Lilo and Stitch movie where
I think like maybe it&#39;s where Stitch
lands on Earth in his in his like
spaceship little spooky
and the boys love it. They think it&#39;s so
They also like the amazing Spider-Man
song. We have like lots of Spidey and
his amazing friends. We got lots of
songs going on.
That&#39;s awesome.
But they have like they&#39;re like that&#39;s
Auggie song, that&#39;s Griffin&#39;s song. And
it&#39;s like it&#39;s a big deal.
Yeah. Are they close?
Oh yeah.
They can&#39;t be separated. Actually, we
dropped them off and they were supposed
to go in separate places
and every single time they have to go
together. Like they have to join the
older like
that&#39;s the blessing of like having them
close together.
Oh, seriously? They like need to be
Yeah. And everybody always asks us if
they&#39;re twins cuz they look they look
like twins.
They&#39;re getting closer in size. So, it&#39;s
Yeah. Yeah. Having a baby, was that
planned? Was it a surprise? Whose idea?
Like if if it wasn&#39;t someone&#39;s idea.
Whose idea was this?
Our moms.
Um how did it start?
How did it start?
We had just started having conversations
about it. Um we were living in Waco,
Texas at the time and you know we were
in Waco, Texas. Grant was working at a
church as a young adults pastor and we
knew that that was a temporary season.
Like we knew wasn&#39;t forever. And so we
had started talking kind of about like
okay we feel the season coming to an
end. Do we stay here? Do we move
somewhere else? Do we stay in ministry?
Do we, you know, what does this look
like? And kids was just such a big part
of that conversation. We felt like in
our perfect world, of course, you can&#39;t
always plan everything, but in our
perfect world, it was like, okay, let&#39;s
be married for a little over a year. And
then whenever we feel like it&#39;s a good
time, start trying for kids. And we were
super thankful and blessed to say that
honestly, it happened a lot quicker than
we expected. I think we honestly
expected it to take a while.
your heart up for like all the stories
you hear.
Well, we walked our friends through
really hard stuff. So, I think we really
expected it to take a long time. Um, and
so we kind of thought it would happen,
you know, maybe once we moved and like
got settled in Tennessee when we felt
led to move to Tennessee. Um, but it
happened pretty quick. So, we were in
Waco, Texas and um found out he actually
it was his last week of the job and
so she didn&#39;t tell me for a full week. I
found out I
She held that in for seven days.
I did.
Tell them how you found out. So I
It&#39;s Sunday. He works at a church. So we
work last Sunday at church
cuz last Sunday on staff at church and I
was like feeling like okay I think I&#39;m
about to start my period but like I am
not feeling the best but I I mean
there&#39;s no way like I&#39;m pregnant.
We just started trying.
We literally just started trying. So, I
was like, there&#39;s no way, but I&#39;m just
going to take, you know, of course, I
had like 30 pregnancy tests just in the
bathroom. And so, I&#39;m like, I&#39;m going to
take a pregnancy test. And it said
pregnant. And I was so not expecting it
that I was like, I didn&#39;t even record my
reaction. I mean, I literally just was
not expecting it. And I was like,
there&#39;s no way. So, I take another one.
And then I take another one and they all
three say pregnant. And I&#39;m like, okay,
I think I&#39;m I think I&#39;m pregnant. But it
was his last week of work. So, I just
was like, I want him to finish. Well,
I was speaking twice at two different
things. And so she&#39;s like, I wanted him
to really focus on this last week and
finish well, but throughout the week,
she would be so emotional with me.
And I thought she was just so sad that
like I was finishing work and she was so
proud of me.
I&#39;m like, I just love you so much.
Yeah, she was like, she really loves
I love you so much. You&#39;re doing such a
good job. And I was like, yeah, babe.
I&#39;m like crushing this week, huh? And
really, she like knows we&#39;re pregnant.
So I&#39;m just like all in my feels of
like, he&#39;s going to be such a good dad,
but he doesn&#39;t know. Like I&#39;m just, you
know, I&#39;m just
Okay. How long did you keep it a secret?
For a week.
So I finished last day, which was like a
Thursday, and then that Friday I go to
like do something. Come back just like
Yeah. And she&#39;s like, &#34;Hey Grant, I have
something for you.&#34; Cuz she was giving
me gifts for my last week. Like here&#39;s a
hoodie. Here&#39;s notes. Hey Grant, I have
one last gift. And I&#39;m like, &#34;Okay, pair
of shoes.&#34; Like what is this? Walk in.
And dude, it was the like wooden we&#39;re
having a baby pregnancy test. Small
Jordan, my size Jordan behind it. Wow.
And I&#39;m just like I like start spinning.
I can&#39;t even speak. I started crying.
Because I just so wasn&#39;t expecting it.
That I don&#39;t know how you sat on that
for a week.
I know. No one knew.
I&#39;m like, &#34;Girl, you can carry a secret.
That&#39;s kind of dangerous right there.&#34;
Like you can hold that in the vault like
I just did not like anytime he asked me
about me, I just I was so selfless that
week. I was like, &#34;No, babe. Tell me
about you. How are you feeling?&#34; I knew
if I started talking, I would, you know,
spill the spill the beans. So, I just I
wanted the moment to be special and I
wanted him to feel like he could fully
celebrate it and I knew his mind was
very consumed with obviously wanting to
finish strong and finish well at his job
and I wanted him to be able to do that
and he just respected so much the head
pastor Jonathan Bakluda and so just
wanted that all that whole season to
like finish well and then I wanted him
to be able to like fully celebrate the
new season of us stepping into like
parenthood and so I just was like I&#39;m
just going to wait and then that gave me
a chance to like plan out like hm how do
I want to tell And I ordered cute
Jordans. And
are those the Jordans right there from
the announcement? No. You think
it should have been?
They&#39;re baby blue.
They&#39;re smooth, huh? Yeah. They&#39;re these
like all white. Just like no color on
them. It was cool though.
Did you kind of like want a girl or have
any preference at all?
Oh, listen. She will tell you she was
indifferent. She&#39;s like, &#34;Grant, I could
care less, boy or girl.&#34; We found out it
was a girl and she&#39;s like, &#34;Praise God.
Thank you, God.&#34;
I just grew up with two sisters, so I
just am so familiar and comfortable. And
like my family used to foster and like
even the little girl we foster, it was a
girl. So like I just am so familiar with
little girls. And so I was like that
would just be so sweet for like our
first to be a girl. Yeah.
But I really was going to be so excited
either way. But
wait, I have to ask I have like an
internal theory. Do you have sisters?
Little sister.
Okay. That really plays well into my
theory. I was telling your team I was
like I have this theory that it&#39;s the
husband&#39;s siblings if you look at them
like if he has a sister they&#39;ll probably
have a girl and if they have brothers
and they&#39;ll probably have a boy
but what if I have both older brother
younger sister
h then I&#39;m I got nothing
twins my mom was like full on in belief
that we were going to have twins and I
was like we&#39;re not having twins like we
would go and the ultrasound and Grant
would literally be like ask the person
no can you check again and just make
sure you think I have no idea. She just
is usually right.
She&#39;s usually always right.
She&#39;s been wrong. Every single baby
we&#39;ve ever had in a family.
So when she has a guest, I&#39;m like I&#39;m
confident in the
She predicted Wait, she predicted girl
for both of our boys. And then after we
were like, it&#39;s a boy. She&#39;s like, I&#39;m
pretty sure it&#39;s
She predicted boy for your uh our
sister-in-law, right? She&#39;s having girl.
She&#39;s always wrong.
I love it.
And then she&#39;s like very confident to
the point where like she starts to
convince me of things. Like I&#39;m like,
&#34;No, be sure.&#34; Because I think cuz with
them with me actually they told my mom
that I was a boy which still makes me
feel weird to this day. I&#39;m like why do
they think that? Like
yeah there&#39;s something like
I&#39;m like
freaks me out. I&#39;m like
after what the heck it was a long time
Don&#39;t carry that anymore. You got to let
that go right now. You are a girl.
But it was like not until like her last
appointment that they were like you
excited to meet your baby girl? And
they&#39;re like boy. And she&#39;s like
no. We literally we had that there
because we had people like randomly come
up and be like I I feel like you&#39;re
having a boy like would say that to me
and I&#39;m like no we&#39;re having a girl like
and I&#39;m like I&#39;ve already started buying
cute please don&#39;t make me switch my mind
dude wait that&#39;s crazy that would like
rock me
dude I know
did they already have the name and
everything for boy
uh no I think they were like really
disappointed they were really expecting
a girl so they like were really kind of
thrown off
when they thought I was going to be a
Wow. So they were really happy when they
were like praise.
Yeah, they seriously were. You guys have
probably seen a million ads for hair
growth products and thought, does this
actually work? Like it&#39;s kind of hard to
believe. And I feel like I have actual
proof that Neutrifold works. I went and
got my haircut. I got a lot of length
tank it off and my hairdresser was like,

fast. Your hair grows so so rapidly.&#34;
And I was like, &#34;Well, I take
Neutrifold. Do you think that has
anything to do with it?&#34; And she was

profession. She knows a lot about hair

Wait, hold up. So pregnancy happened one
year. I love timelines. I&#39;m trying to
get the timeline right.
I&#39;m a big time guy, too. I&#39;ve recently
discovered this. So yeah, you got
pregnant and that was a year after you
got marriedish. Um
you like waited a year to start trying.
You got pregnant right away?
No. So it was a we got married October
of 22. Okay.
Got pregnant May of
A year and a half.
A year and a half. Year and a half.
Yeah. Year and a half.
Okay. Nice. And then before that when
you started dating, you guys went from
like meeting to like you got married
pretty quickly after you met, right?
Oh yeah.
What like what was that timeline? Let&#39;s
talk about that timeline.
Let&#39;s talk timeline, bro. Cuz I&#39;m a big
timeline guy. Blind date December 3rd.
How did that happen?
Yeah. Who set this up? Matt literally
told me on the way here cuz we knew that
you guys met on a blind date. Matt&#39;s
like, &#34;Why do I feel like it&#39;s like
dating in the dark?&#34; And I&#39;m like,
&#34;No, seriously.&#34; I was like, &#34;Abby,
could they like when it&#39;s a blind date,
could they see each other? Like are you
guys is there a wall between you and
each other?&#34; So that whole dating scene,
y&#39;all met in eighth grade. Y&#39;all missed
the whole dating scene.
Or like Love is Blind, right? Like isn&#39;t
that like Love is Blind? It&#39;s like you
you you&#39;re on another side of a wall and
it&#39;s just all about your community.
We should have done that. Honestly,
that is crazy.
Okay, but each other. You guys can see
each other. Yeah. Yeah, we we we were
there. I literally I learn I was
literally 10 years old when I learned
Matt was like nervous to bring it up.
A blind date.
They were blindfolded.
No, seriously. I was like, &#34;Are you
blindfolded?&#34;
He was so embarrassed. He&#39;s like He&#39;s
like, &#34;You&#39;re not You can You can see
each other when you go on. That&#39;s
hilarious. Have you never met anyone
who&#39;s been on a blind date?&#34;
I don&#39;t think so.
Actually, how does it work? Like, had
you guys talked at all or did your
friends just like crazy? It was kind of
blind date, kind of not because it was
supposed to be a blind date, but then I
peer pressured my friend who knew that I
was going on the date with Grant. She
knew of Grant or like had met Grant. I
peer pressured her cuz I knew she knew
who he was and I said, &#34;Who is it?&#34;
Oh, like you didn&#39;t even know who it
No, I had no idea who it was. And then
she told me and then I stalked him on
Instagram.
Okay. So, but were you fully blind?
I was blind because I they said, &#34;Don&#39;t
look at her Instagram.&#34;
And they just like, &#34;Hey, her name&#39;s
Maddie.&#34; But here&#39;s the crazy thing. Six
months before I got set up with Maddie
on a blind date, she walks into the
church I was working at. I look at her.
She&#39;s wearing these Jordans. I was like,
&#34;Who is this girl?&#34; And uh my friend was
like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s Maddie. She went on
this show. Like, don&#39;t even bother.&#34; And
like said, I didn&#39;t have a shot. I was
like, &#34;Come on, bro.&#34; And same friend
goes on this podcast and was like, &#34;Hey,
you should go on a blind date with my
friend.&#34; I come home for Thanksgiving
break and he goes, &#34;Grant, you got to go
on a date December 3rd.&#34; It was like
November. He&#39;s like, &#34;December 3rd? You
can&#39;t say no.&#34; I was like, &#34;Dude, what?&#34;
And he literally goes, &#34;Grant, you miss
a 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&#34; And
I was like, &#34;I&#39;m going.&#34; Yeah.
He&#39;s like, &#34;Okay, her name is Maddie.
It&#39;s the girl you saw walk in, but don&#39;t
look up anything.&#34; And so, like, I knew
who she was, but that was the extent. I
didn&#39;t like know anything else.
Okay. So,
yeah. But I just I had this crazy
feeling like whenever he came to pick me
up, I had like the craziest feeling. I
just was like, &#34;This feels different.&#34;
And I like never get nervous. And I was
so nervous. Like I just was like
sweating. I was like asking my roommate.
She was chewing her gum like
smacking my gum. I was like, &#34;Do I look
okay? Do I need to change?&#34; Like I was
so nervous and I was too.
He came and picked me up. And one thing
my dad is always so big on gentlemen.
He&#39;s like, &#34;Whoever you date, you better
open your door.&#34;
So I It&#39;s like ingrained in me. I&#39;m
like, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m testing like he&#39;s got
to open my door.&#34;
So we we go outside to the car. He&#39;s
like so like in his head nervous. He
doesn&#39;t open my door, my car door. So
I&#39;m just sitting here and I&#39;m like I&#39;m
so nervous for going to open my door and
I close it. Open my door when we get
there and I&#39;m like so I&#39;m already kind
of like ah off to a bad start.
I open your door when we got there,
I can&#39;t remember.
But I do I do know the first one you did
And it was like listen I&#39;m raised in the
south. I&#39;m Dallas. So I&#39;m like always
opening up doors and literally in my
head I&#39;m thinking open up a door. Open
up a door
as we&#39;re walking to the car and just go
straight to mine.
And then I hit one of these
on like X. You know when you&#39;re stuck in
the and you try and reach over to open
up their door like that?
First dates you have to like kind of be
cool. So he&#39;s like, &#34;Ah.&#34;
Anyways, we
I addressed it immediately. I said,
&#34;Listen, I&#39;m so sorry. I should have
opened your door.&#34; It wasn&#39;t like I just
We get to the restaurant and we sit down
and I&#39;m just like his joy was so
evident. Like he just was like so joyful
and the way he talked to like the
waitress and the waiter. Like it just I
like him. Like he&#39;s he&#39;s special. like
the way he&#39;s like just so kind with
everyone and full of joy. I was just
like so drawn to it. And as we began to
like share our stories and just like
what God had done in our life and what
we felt called to do with our life. I
just felt a radical like piece of I&#39;m
going to marry this man. And I literally
texted my mom. He like goes up to go to
the bathroom and I texted my mom and I
was like I&#39;m going to marry him. Like
this is my husband. And this was like an
hour into the date.
Meanwhile,
he&#39;s like
I&#39;m sweating thinking the date is going
just okay. I&#39;m like, I&#39;m not doing that
good. And she&#39;s going, &#34;Mom, I just
found the man I&#39;m going to marry.&#34;
And that I feel like is difference than
guys and girls. I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh my gosh,
does she like me? Is this okay?&#34; But
anyways, we got in the car afterwards
and I was like, &#34;Hey, you want to listen
to like some Drake and drive around the
car or drive around the city?&#34;
And she literally had been like, &#34;Hey,
here&#39;s what I want in the husband I&#39;m
going to marry.&#34;
You know what&#39;s like, you know, like the
weird like little things that you&#39;re
like, &#34;This isn&#39;t like a deal breaker,
but this would just be like cherry on
top like so sweet.&#34; Okay.
One of those things was like I just love
to like turn on some fun music, drive
around and just like sing, have a good
time, you know, laugh, chill.
And I randomly had said like a couple
weeks prior, I was like,
&#34;It would just be so sweet if like I
went on a date and you know, the guy was
like, &#34;You want to just drive around and
listen to like some fun music?&#34; I
literally said that and then he looks at
me as soon as we get in the car and he&#39;s
like, &#34;You want to just drive around and
like listen to some music?&#34; And
which song? Which Drake song was it? And
this was so that was like 3 years ago.
It was probably like nothing was the
same album. Okay.
This was like we went we went way back.
We were Nothing was the same.
But we did stop halfway through and we
prayed for Drake.
We prayed for Drake. Man,
what did you pray for Drake? What did
you Well, we prayed for his salvation.
Like I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s going
through, but here&#39;s what we do know,
Matt and Abby. Here&#39;s what we do know.
That you can have the whole world and be
so empty. Yeah. And so you see that we
and y&#39;all see that you&#39;re around so many
people that have influence and you can
have I grew up in you know my dad went
from homeless with his mom to sold his
company for3.2 billion dollars
and I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of leaning into a
serious moment and he I remember him
telling me he said Grant I was homeless
at the park with my mom I went home
after selling my company for $3 billion.
He said the feeling didn&#39;t change.
Everyone told me when I got here I would
be happy and satisfied. He said, &#34;Money
and success only allows for you to look
for happiness in a better neighborhood.&#34;
And he said, &#34;I went home to the hotel
and I remember everyone went out to
party and I&#39;m home alone.&#34; He said, &#34;All
I could do was pick up a pen and and
write down the next thing I could
accomplish.&#34;
And so for two to three years, he was
buying the houses, doing the things,
everything that his heart he was he was
abandoned by his dad. And so he said, &#34;I
know what&#39;s going to fix all this.&#34;
And it was going to be money. And in the
midst of all that, he&#39;s just like
searching. And money satisfies for a
while until it doesn&#39;t. And so he hits
this point, my mom gets radically saved
and she starts telling him about a
heavenly father and he&#39;s like, &#34;I want
nothing to do with a heavenly father.&#34;
And uh
because he&#39;s like, &#34;My father abandoned
me and abused me.&#34;
So yeah, and this is crazy. And I I&#39;ve
told a story before, but my dad was born
out of rape. So 15-year-old mom gets
raped, can&#39;t afford uh the hospital, so
it has him in a parking lot.
those families lived on the same set of
land divided by uh a fence and they say,
&#34;Hey, we&#39;re not going to let this get
out. Y&#39;all are getting married.&#34; So, she
had to marry into that situation. So,
that dad did that to that mom, to his
mom, he&#39;s now looking at this baby, my
dad, as like, &#34;You ruined my life.&#34;
So, he would leave for a month, come
home, beat him. You ruined my life. So,
my dad grew up with this this just like
hole of abandonment. Well, anyways, he
got everything the world says should be
happy. That&#39;s the American dream.
Homeless to billionaire. And he&#39;s
sitting in this moment and mom gets
radically saved. She&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, wait.
Jesus Christ. This is what I was made
for.&#34; Starts telling my dad about a
heavenly father. He&#39;s like, &#34;I&#39;m out.&#34;
Two years into that, he opens up his
Bible to say, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m going to show
you how stupid this is.
I&#39;m going to prove you wrong.
I&#39;m going to prove you wrong.&#34; And
begins to read this Bible. And God gets
his foot in the door. And at 3:00 a.m.
in the Cayman Islands, my dad uh hears
this debate on the TV. He didn&#39;t turn it
on. that just came on and it&#39;s a
Christian, atheist, Muslim, and a Hindu,
all the religions. And uh
the Christian goes, &#34;Hey, we all agree
upon one thing. There&#39;s a higher power.
But here&#39;s where we disagree is how to
get there.&#34; He says, &#34;Let&#39;s say all of
you are right. Every other religion,
let&#39;s say you&#39;re right. I still get in.
I live the same life that you do. I
still get into to heaven. But let&#39;s say
I&#39;m right that Jesus Christ said, &#34;I&#39;m
the way, the truth, and the life. No one
comes to the father except through me.&#34;
He said, &#34;There&#39;s a tremendous downside
for you.&#34; My dad was raised by his uncle
who would host these underground poker
tournaments. He would he would deal my
dad hands all day and make him calculate
the percentage of what his hand would
be. In this moment, the calculations of
the percentages come into his mind. He
gets on his knees at 3:00 a.m. gives his
life to Christ. And that&#39;s when our
family just like shifted from we have
things of the world to
oh wait, there&#39;s more. All that to say,
I went so deep to say Drizzy Drake, who
I love, can have the whole world. And my
dad actually has, and I don&#39;t want, this
is not arrogant at all. He he has maybe
more money than Drake, but here&#39;s the
crazy thing is everybody at that level
is searching for something more. This is
an ad by BetterHelp. Today I actually
went to therapy and I thought it was
really good to talk through this idea of
sitting in discomfort cuz that&#39;s
something I&#39;ve been learning from
therapy is it&#39;s okay to be
uncomfortable. You don&#39;t have to put a
smile on your face or crack a joke to
make the discomfort in your life go
away. It&#39;s it&#39;s okay to like let your
body and your mind process that
discomfort. And that is why I am a huge
fan of BetterHelp because not only is it

It&#39;s widely known online that you come
from a family where your dad&#39;s been very
successful. What do people get wrong
about you because of that? What are like
assumptions people make about you?
Yeah, dude. That&#39;s
a lot. It&#39;s like how much time do you
have now?
That&#39;s a great question, man. I love
people genuinely. like I feel like I
really just love people and I forget
that that&#39;s a part of my life. Um not in
a way that I don&#39;t like really really
appreciate and love and I&#39;m so grateful,
but I forget that at times I walk in a
room and that&#39;s attached to me. Like I
really do. I think I&#39;ve just had to
learn that like you will be
misunderstood. People will misassign
things. Pe people will put things on you
and that&#39;s okay and it&#39;s not even wrong
that they do. It&#39;s just like her and I
have both talked about that when when we
meet people at times it feels like we
start down here and it&#39;s almost like hey
prove to me that you&#39;re legit.
I&#39;m not sure how y&#39;all feel about all
that anyways. I&#39;d love to hear y&#39;all&#39;s
perspective through success and stuff
but uh I always talk to Maddie about
this. You can either be LeBron on the
Cavs when he first got drafted or you
can be LeBron on the Heat. And if y&#39;all
are yall
you&#39;re going have to really explain what
that is. You&#39;re not really sports.
Y&#39;all know LeBron James.
We know LeBron.
So yeah. Not personally. I I uh Anyways,
it&#39;s a long story.
You know LeBron James.
We have a moment. I grabbed his calf.
Yeah, his calf. Anyways,
wait. You just said
you touched LeBron. I didn&#39;t even know
the story.
Let me tell the story really quick. Um
LeBron James was from Akran, Ohio. Okay.
He was the He was dubbed the chosen one
on the cover of Sports Illustrated at
16. He was Ohio&#39;s guy. Cleveland, Ohio,
the basketball team, they drafted him.
So, he&#39;s like this hometown hero. And he
was 18 years old in the NBA. He was so
free, young, joyful, happy. Well, when
he was 25, after he had been Cleveland&#39;s
guy for so long, he decided, &#34;I&#39;m
leaving Cleveland and I&#39;m going to play
for the Miami Heat.&#34;
Now, everyone who loved LeBron, all of a
sudden, there was all these viral
videos. They were burning his jersey.
You&#39;re a traitor. You&#39;re Because he was
going to play with some other superstars
in Miami.
Now, LeBron,
who&#39;s a human being, went from the world
loving you to the world hating you. You
became villain. Yeah. He changed his
number from 23 to six. He started
wearing this dark mask. He had like
broken his nose. He put on this all
black mask
and literally started playing into what
everyone was saying about him. You could
literally see it on him.
You saw like a a free kid to like a
really hurt kind of like villain. And I
always tell Maddie, I said, &#34;Hey, when
we play into what people want to say
about us, what they want to assume about
us, um you can put the hood on and go,
&#34;Well, forget it. If that&#39;s what who you
think I am, then like I&#39;ll be that.
And that&#39;s extreme. But I can get really
hurt from hearing what some people say
and you can almost put the hood on and
go, you don&#39;t
like forget you.
You don&#39;t you don&#39;t get me. Like no one
gets me. Dangerous place to be.
I always want to be in a place of I&#39;m
going to love you with my joy. Um kill
him with kindness is that kind of
phrase. Like all that to say,
I think there&#39;s times I can be
misunderstood with that. Um, and also I
get it. I get it, man. Like, hey, I get
the stuff where you go, it&#39;s easy to be
a Christian when you have money or what
do you have to worry about? Go cry in
the range. I get all that, man. I&#39;m not
fighting that at all. And there are
different problems. And no one is exempt
from pain and no one is exempt from uh
teeyed nights and struggles. You know,
they may look different, but there&#39;s
weight all around. And so, I would just
say like I have compassion and grace for
that. I don&#39;t hold I don&#39;t there&#39;s no
anger at anybody. And also, I do want
people to see the joy and the love and
the genuine like um I&#39;m just a
relational optimistic person and that
can try and make me like you can&#39;t trust
anybody, you can&#39;t and I just don&#39;t want
to ever like flow out of that place.
Well, and Grant is just so
opposite of like everything that like
when you hear billion or you hear
wealth, like he just couldn&#39;t be more
opposite of what is typically associated
with that. and he could stay in the same
t-shirt from H&amp;amp;M or Walmart every single
day. He finds the person in the room
that like everybody else overlooks and
you know, everybody&#39;s trying to find the
most important person in the room to
like climb the social ladder. He finds
the person that everybody else overlooks
and he loves on them. He gets to know
them. He like continues a relationship
with them. He genuinely lives his life
to serve people and to help people and
that is constantly at the forefront of
his mind. And so like I&#39;m just so
grateful that I am led by a man who like
even if he was born into that and he
like you know you can&#39;t control
necessarily what you&#39;re born into but
like he was born into wealth but yet he
doesn&#39;t live his life as if that is even
a factor. We try not to live our life
like that&#39;s a factor and just
continuously position oursel in a place
of like how can we give how can we live
um as servants? how can we um continue
to just, you know, give what&#39;s been
given to us back? And I&#39;m so grateful
for that.
Thanks for saying all that. And there&#39;s
so many benefits like the house we live
in here in Tennessee. So grateful. You
know, the cars we drive, so grateful.
There&#39;s things that I&#39;m like,
yeah, that&#39;s that I&#39;m so h I&#39;m so
grateful about that, but that doesn&#39;t
define who I am.
Yeah. You know, totally. Yeah. I I mean
just a little bit from our um what we&#39;ve
experienced as people also in the public
eye. I know we&#39;ve had simple stuff like
there was an article about YouTubers
buying houses in Hawaii and we were
listed as someone that bought a house in
Hawaii when we didn&#39;t. We were living we
were renting and we lived there for 11
months and we moved back. Um and there
was also you know there&#39;s there&#39;s
articles about our net worth that are
you know I wish they were true. They
they say that we are worth like way more
than we are generous. We we are you know
we&#39;re very blessed. We&#39;re very lucky.
But I&#39;m like man that is like 10x of
what it actually is. You know it&#39;s just
like so I mean has there been ever been
anything like that with you guys where
something&#39;s been published or a rumor
that&#39;s been spread where you&#39;re like
that is literally completely untrue and
and it like and it it you know drives
you crazy.
Oh even our wedding I mean people even
thought our wedding we dropped like $4
million on our wedding. Just someone
said it was $4 million.
Oh yeah. Like people were making Tik
Toks and reals like, &#34;Okay, going off of
this assessment and how much these
flowers would cost and this this this
and they like estimated that it was like
$4 million.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Wow.&#34; I
mean, $4 million wedding. That&#39;s
awesome. Was not our story. Um, but we
were blessed to like be able to do the
wedding at his parents house, you know,
which just had a beautiful backyard. And
so like our venue was free and you know,
it&#39;s like things like that that we were
super grateful for. and I partnered with
like, you know, some different brands
and stuff that were so kind and
generous. But yeah, our wedding was not
$4 million. Not even a fraction of that.
It&#39;s funny you mentioned that because I
saw like something pop up about like 1.5
and somebody was like, &#34;No, it was it
was a million dollars on flowers.&#34; Like
people were like everyone has like their
their estimation, right? Um so that&#39;s
that&#39;s interesting that you that you say
that because I was I was curious. I was
like I I wonder I wonder what it was.
I wonder what it was. No. Yeah. and and
it&#39;s it&#39;s just yeah, it&#39;s funny like
people want to have opinions and like to
place them and make them, but I think
for us what&#39;s been most important is
like doing life with people that are
just going to continuously keep us
grounded and like call us out, call out
our blind spots, point us back to the
truth and what really matters. Because
it&#39;s so easy to get lost in the sauce.
It&#39;s so easy to like get caught up in
what you know everybody else is chasing,
but also to get caught up in what
everybody else thinks. It&#39;s like, oh,
they think this about me, so now I got
to prove myself or I got to keep and
maintain, you know, this opinion about
me. Like, I want to continue to be liked
by everybody. I want to continue to be
seen this way or I want to, you know,
create this narrative for me. It&#39;s just
so easy to get caught up in all that
stuff. And it&#39;s exhausting. You know,
you just will find yourself like
constantly exhausted and overwhelmed by
that. It is hard when you get a lot of
like comments and and you find yourself
on E-News and People magazine, all those
Okay. Wait, let me ask ask you guys this
because I&#39;m actually so curious now.
Like ever since Abby and I started, you
know, making money, we&#39;ve been generous.
We&#39;ve been like wanting to support
charities that we really love. I always
thought about, man, yeah, the more money
that I can make, the more I can give,
the more that I can help fund charities
like Charity Water, the more that I can
give. Um there&#39;s also a charity called
Give Well, where they find the best uh
like like the charities that are doing
the most to help save lives per dollar
spent, you know, cuz some charities you
have to spend millions of dollars to
save one life. Totally. Well, give give
well. They literally do so much.
I&#39;m such a maximizer by nature. It
usually has to do with malaria actually.
But yeah, I mean, so for me, I was like,
man, I just it&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
numbers problem. I want to solve this
numbers problem. But what I&#39;ve been
realizing too is like I&#39;ve have not been
volunteering as much as I used to in my
youth. And I&#39;m like, I need a volunteer.
Like it doesn&#39;t matter that maybe I
could be using that time to raise like
to make more money than give to charity.
It&#39;s like I want to like actually like
with my hands and my feet like volunteer
like so like what what&#39;s your approach
to that? How do you guys balance like
volunteering but also giving financially
to charities that you you love? When you
have money,
it&#39;s actually a lot easier to write the
check and send it and not kind of deal
with any of it. It&#39;s another thing to
give your time and go be with somebody
and sit and get dirty and be with them
in that. That&#39;s where we found a lot of
joy. And it doesn&#39;t mean you got to go
overseas. You know, we we meet with this
high school crew every Wednesday night
and we love it. But I believe everyone
has a gift. So my dad, man, he&#39;s so
generous, like the most generous person
I know. I feel a little bit more called
to be like hands and feet in it. I&#39;d
love to hear how you think through it,
but we um I love your heart because
there is something about giving up your
because that actually that actually
hurts, you know? Not saying the money
doesn&#39;t hurt, but when you have money,
you can give money and you&#39;re like,
&#34;Okay, like, yeah, that hurts to give
that, but when I&#39;m going to go spend
eight hours on a Saturday morning,
that that&#39;s like something else that I
think is beautiful.&#34;
That&#39;s the most beautiful part of giving
is when there&#39;s sacrifice. That&#39;s the
most beautiful part of giving is when it
comes with a cost. It&#39;s not hard to give
when it&#39;s not hard to give, you know?
Um, and so like what does it look like
for us to to view it from the
perspective of like if for us we&#39;re in a
busier season, then maybe for us in that
season like giving time is more of a
sacrifice than giving money. And so
whatever that looks like, I think for
us, we&#39;re continuously processing like
what does it look like for us to give
out of lack? Where what does it look
like for us to give in a way that like
hurts a little bit, that like creates a
sacrifice um that comes with a cost? And
it&#39;s we&#39;ve not arrived. Like we&#39;re
continuing to pray through that and
continuing to ask that question. Like
we&#39;re figuring out that question
literally like we&#39;re like do we sell
everything? Do we move across the globe,
you know, do we live on nothing? Do we
um live in a small apartment and just
like, you know, like what does it look
like? Um if we have a house, you know,
then we need to be like hosting in our
house. We need to be using our house to
serve people. We need to be using our
house to wash feet. and like thinking of
it in that sense of like if we have it,
we need to give it. Um if we don&#39;t have
it, then maybe there&#39;s a different form
of giving, you know, for somebody who
doesn&#39;t have access to a lot of money,
like that&#39;s okay. There&#39;s still so much
you can give, whether it&#39;s your time,
your talent, your resources, your
connections, your relationships. Um and
so we&#39;re constantly thinking through, I
think, all of those different elements
and processing through that.
We got like into a rabbit hole there,
but I really like that. How did we get
to, you know, conversation? started with
We We prayed for Drake.
It was It was praying for Drake.
So, we were on the blind date.
We were talking about your blind date
and then you guys we were talking about
it all started. It all started with we
had a really quick we got engaged after
7 months.
Yes. Okay. So, engaged. It was seven
Seven you you guys got engaged seven
months after you met. Yeah.
And then
three-month engagement.
Three month engagement. So, within 10
months you were married.
Pops is a basketball coach at Auburn.
Was he looked at me, he said, &#34;Grant,
you can get married in October or
April.&#34; And I was like, &#34;You know what?
I&#39;m going to choose. Let&#39;s go October.
I&#39;m not going to wait that long. Yeah.
Um and it was a three-month engagement.
Holy cow.
I felt barely in it. That girl carried
the weight.
Yeah, it was it was a lot. Like you were
stressed about the planning and
everything. It was a lot. We had a 400
person wedding. So, it was not like a
small I think if we had like just gone
and aloped like through.
But we planned a big old a big old
gathering and it was it was fun. I&#39;m
super glad we did it. But it was
stressful.
Was any of that stress? Because this
wasn&#39;t the first time that you were
engaged, right?
What? Like what? Like wasn&#39;t there?
I&#39;d never been engaged before.
Oh, there wasn&#39;t. Did I get there? Wait,
maybe I maybe I totally I hold up. Yeah,
tell me more, brother. Because you may
know a story.
Did I like mess this up then? I I
apologize.
No, no, no. You&#39;re good. Grant&#39;s heart
started racing.
Yeah, you were like, &#34;Wait, where did
you get this tea?&#34; Like, what?
I was like, &#34;This is some tea.&#34;
Well, he has not ever seen any part of
the Bachelor of episode, so he probably
You&#39;ve never seen any of that? No.
really. Okay. Have you ever seen like
any of the Bachelor ever?
No. Never.
Never. Okay.
I&#39;m a free man, brother. This is
You know how they uh wives will joke
that if they&#39;re watching like the
Kardashians or the Bachelor, like their
husbands are like, &#34;Why are you watching
the show?&#34; And then the husband over
that was me as a kids. My mom would
watch the Bachelor and I would be like,
&#34;Mom, so dumb
eating like cereal like like late at
night because my mom wouldn&#39;t let us eat
like Lucky Charms for breakfast cuz
that&#39;s like way too sugary.&#34; But it was
like my dessert, right? I&#39;m like eating
cereal just like what&#39;s going on? Like
what&#39;s the tea? Like oh my gosh, they&#39;re
they&#39;re kissing on the show. I&#39;m like
I&#39;m like, &#34;Mom, are they like married to
all these people? Like, what&#39;s how does
this work?&#34;
Put up your heart.
I love it, bro.
Yeah, it&#39;s
So, did you watch her season? Did y&#39;all
I I didn&#39;t see your season?
I think I did. I It was one of the last
seasons I watched, but I I&#39;m like trying
to figure our age difference because I&#39;m
like I remember thinking I was like,
&#34;Everyone on the Bachelor is so much
older than me.&#34; I was probably the same
age as like all the kids.
We&#39;re 29.
Okay. I I&#39;m 26.
Yeah. 27.
I feel like I did I don&#39;t remember. How
old were you then?
I was like 23 24. So then I was in
college. I probably did watch it. I
probably were in college. Like I knew
everyone on the I feel like I knew of
Were you for Maddie or against Maddie?
I know. She&#39;s like,
&#34;Here&#39;s the thing. I I was I was for
Maddie.&#34; Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Wait, I didn&#39;t. It was like a sides
Who was the other girl that ended with?
Well, we&#39;re all friends now. Just off
the record or just for the record.
Do you hear that people? They&#39;re all
friends now.
All friends now. They&#39;re cool. No bad
blood. No drama.
No. Truly so for each other. And um
yeah, her name was Hannah. She was the
second. She was on our podcast. They did
get engaged.
Yeah. Yeah.
They did get engaged. So that&#39;s probably
what you&#39;re thinking of. Yeah. Yeah.
So he I I broke up with him the day
before and then he got engaged to Han.
I certainly watched. This is all coming
back. I I certainly watched it. Let me
just say this. Like I I know your facts
were wrong.
I know my facts were wrong. So like take
what I say with a grain of salt, but
like my uh I saw a a clip
matt facts were not facts. Actually like
the sources were wrong. I I believe it
was a a mother-in-law that was like
digging into you on live TV and I was
just like I cannot believe this is real.
I wasn&#39;t even watching it live. Like I&#39;m
sure like live must have been like but
live was wild.
How did you keep your composure?
I can&#39;t even remember what aired or what
y&#39;all I don&#39;t even know if I watched my
season all the way through. I&#39;ll be very
honest. It was traumatizing. I lost like
20 pounds. I was like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
know. I very much remove myself from all
things Bachelor even still to this day.
Like I really don&#39;t talk about it a ton.
So I think there was maybe if I remember
it&#39;s not really remembering totally
clearly I think there was maybe a moment
where just essentially the conversation
was like I don&#39;t think the two of you
make sense and you belong together which
I mean now looking back I&#39;m like totally
totally but I think it was like probably
said maybe very firmly and not in the
kindest way. And then I think headed
into finale it like was more intense
than I think anybody was. I just didn&#39;t
expect anything other than just like him
and I having an honest conversation of
like is this even a possibility? And so
yeah, I was very much blindsided by it.
Was very sad by it. But then I think as
soon as it ended, I just was like, you
know what, I just trust everything&#39;s
going to work out the way that it&#39;s
supposed to. And we ended up, you know,
for sure like not trying to continue in
the relationship. And now looking back,
I&#39;m obviously so grateful for that. And
um the way that even that moment just
like it just built up like a strength I
think in me of just like even having
wisdom to know like when to speak and
when not to speak and like what to say
and what not to say. And in that moment
showing that sometimes true courage is
not saying anything at all. And
sometimes true strength is, you know,
not defending yourself and like popping
off. And when I walked off stage, it was
really hard. I for sure like went and
locked myself in a bathroom and cried.
And you know, I feel like it just built
some strong skin. Um, and there was
definitely continued I think even from
that moment like more things I walked
through with just you know people
talking about me on podcast and e-
newsws and all kinds of different things
and even today that still stuff happens
and grant not watching her season is
that so that you protect yourself. I
just had never seen it and then when I
came to meet her and she started telling
me about all the Bachelor story I was
just like I want to know this Maddie
right here. Yeah. And so, uh, I don&#39;t
think she&#39;d want to go see my
ex-girlfriend moments.
Yeah. No, you know, that is really
You know what I&#39;m saying? So, I I I just
was like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beneficial
for for either of us. Let&#39;s just like
let&#39;s start here.
But tell me all about it.
I want to know, you know, how how was
it? How did it hurt? Yeah.
How serious was it? Um,
so you&#39;ve heard all about it from her.
Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was
a really hard time for her. And I mean,
you sign all these things with Basher
that you can&#39;t say publicly, but it&#39;s
like there&#39;s just really hard things
that you go through on that show.
Um, and so I think I saw someone that
had some scars. And so I was like, hey,
I just want to know this, Maddie.
Something about your story talking about
your first date experience, like you
being like texting your mom like, I&#39;m
going to marry this guy. Um, that stood
out to me because you actually were just
talking to a couple that were like she
kind of stepped away from the
relationship after. was like I didn&#39;t
feel like this overwhelming like moment
where like this is my husband and so it
freaked her out at first then they ended
up getting back together all is well but
um that stood out to me and so like kind
of talk about that moment did your
experience give you more clarity on what
you were looking for like so that moment
could be so like this is it I had you
know been on just you know a good amount
of of dates like I just I believed on
like saying yes and so for me like
seeing lots of different good guys,
godly guys. And for me, there were just
like very specific things that I was
praying for um in the person that I
wanted to partner with for for life and
build a family with and do ministry
with. And I just hadn&#39;t seen it. And I
felt in some way, shape, or form in
every relationship that I had been in
prior to Grant, there would have been
some little thing in me that felt like I
was going to settle. Like it was like if
I get in this relationship, maybe
there&#39;s this aspect of a person that I
really, really like, but in this area,
I&#39;m going to have to settle. like in
this area, I&#39;m just gonna have to be
okay with, you know, maybe this thing
about their their faith or this thing
about what they want to do with their
life or this whatever. Like, I&#39;m gonna
have to settle in some way, shape, or
form. So, there was a little bit of a
lack of peace. And I&#39;m thankful that I
leaned into that lack of peace instead
of ignoring it and ended those
relationships. With Grant, it just felt
like full confirmation of like you&#39;re
not going to have to settle like in
everything you&#39;ve been praying for, this
man has. That&#39;s not to say he&#39;s perfect.
That&#39;s not to say our relationship was
perfect. We for sure went through stuff
and, you know, even broke up a time or
two and our dating experience in those
short little 10 months there. But from
the beginning, I felt um, you know, this
is someone that I want to partner with
and do life with forever.
Was that confusing when you guys broke
up in that 10-month period? Because I&#39;m
sure if like texting your mom, I&#39;m going
to marry this man and then you break up,
you probably were like,
okay, what like what do I do?
Oh, Matt, listen. Why did you break up
with me?
Yeah, he broke up with me.
She I&#39;m living in Branson, Missouri in
this like cabin serving these kids. I&#39;m
like literally scrubbing toilets. She&#39;s
got two million followers. She&#39;s in this
all pink puma jumpsuit and she&#39;s kind of
he&#39;s judging my fashion. I love that.
And uh there was some pride in me, if
we&#39;re going to go a little spiritual,
that was like, hey, mine&#39;s the more
honorable route, which is like not a
platform, choosing what&#39;s not flashy.
And so I think when I got set up with
her because of what I had come from,
which was money and wealth, I wanted
nothing to I I I wanted so far to be um
not in that world.
And uh I think when we were starting to
come together, I was just intimidated by
the platform. I also was feeling
familiar things with just kind of that
world of money and fame and just like I
was loving this girl but I think I was
getting fearful of like the life
and I was like this is not what I ever
envisioned for a wife but this girl
loves God and loves people but like man
there&#39;s some stuff with her. You walk
down the street, hey, will you hold this
phone? Take a picture. And all of a
sudden, you&#39;re you&#39;re the guy holding
the phone taking a picture of your girl
and some girl and you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh,
that&#39;s a weird feeling as a man I&#39;m
going to have to like wrestle with.&#34; You
know what I&#39;m saying? Like you&#39;re you&#39;re
you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m typically the one
that is known.&#34; Like now it&#39;s her. And
so I&#39;m giving you all the details of
there&#39;s all these different feelings
going on inside of me. Insecurity,
pride, those things are rising up. And
once those were like, you know, when you
um purify gold, you melt it and the
impurities rise and you scrape them off,
then you have pure gold. When I dated
Maddie, there was some stuff in here
that because of the level and scale of
her of her life,
just kind of like heated me up and there
were some impurities that needed to come
out. And so when we say break up, we
broke up for 12 hours. Went to a love is
blind or went to not love is blind.
Love is blind. Oh, redeeming love. Have
you all read that book? Oh yeah, I read
We&#39;ve got a crazy story though.
We never watched it though. Everyone was
I heard some criticism about it
We This is I&#39;ll make it really clear.
Don&#39;t let that deter us.
We ended for a day. This was the same
day I was going to meet her family.
Yeah, they had flown in.
They had flown in
because I was hosting the Redeeming Love
Wrong day to break up
in Dallas. I know. He breaks up with me
as my family&#39;s getting into.
Are you like crying at the Redeeming
Love premiere?
I&#39;m crying. But here&#39;s the thing. I knew
it was my husband. So, you know, she
goes back.
So, I So, I tell him, I&#39;m like, host,
you should still come.
She&#39;s hosting in a movie theater. Like,
you know, when someone grabs the mic.
Yeah. She&#39;s hosting this movie. All of
her best friends and family come to this
Grant, you should still come.
Yeah. I&#39;m like, I think you should still
be there. You know, I&#39;ve read the book.
I&#39;ve seen and I&#39;ve already previewed the
movie. I&#39;m like, I think you could learn
a thing or two about some unconditional
love. You know what I mean? So, I&#39;m
like, you should come to Redeeming Love
knowing this is going to be
So, we&#39;re not together. We&#39;re broken up.
I&#39;m meeting mom. I&#39;m meeting sister not
knowing. Do they know?
Oh, your parents don&#39;t know.
They did know, but I didn&#39;t know.
Yeah, he didn&#39;t know that.
I was like, she wouldn&#39;t tell them.
Surely, she told everybody.
So, I&#39;m meeting everybody like, &#34;Hey,
mama.&#34; Like, but we&#39;re broken up.
And they&#39;re looking at you like, &#34;Who&#39;s
Who&#39;s this? Who&#39;s this a-hole that just
broke up with my sweet girl?&#34;
All of her best friends are like, &#34;Good
to meet you.
We&#39;re here. We&#39;re here.&#34;
And next thing I know, I&#39;m sitting in
this movie next to Maddie, her mom, and
sister watching Redeeming Love. And I&#39;m
just like,
it is like this story of this like
radical, unconditional, relentless love.
Like no matter what you&#39;ve been through,
I&#39;m gonna pursue you to the end.
This man that I&#39;m not is on the screen.
And it just it was such a honestly it
was just so cool like him. I think
getting to meet just like my family and
like my mentor was there. She had such a
piece that Grant was also my husband and
so she was like fighting for it. She
meets Grant. She&#39;s like, &#34;How are you
and Maddie doing?&#34; And Grant&#39;s like,
&#34;Well, actually, I just broke up with
her.&#34; And she&#39;s like, &#34;What?&#34; She&#39;s
like, &#34;You&#39;re coming over to mine and
Zach&#39;s house tonight and we&#39;re going to
talk about this. Like, you guys are
going to figure this out.&#34; And he ends
up going over like the next day. And
they just like really encouraged him and
um just affirmed like a lot of the
things that even like I had been through
and had to work through. It was really
good. But by the end of the night after
the premiere, we were like holding hands
and back together.
Long story short,
so when we say broke up, it was like we
had a few moments of questioning, but I
think like and I&#39;m not sure if y&#39;all had
that since 8th grade. I&#39;m sure y&#39;all had
some moments.
We were too young. Like it&#39;s like hard
to even remember.
Yeah. When did y&#39;all get married? How
I was 20.
That&#39;s what I was thinking. I was like,
I actually might not have because I was
living with Matt then. So I was like, I
definitely knew of you, but I like
definitely don&#39;t know if I watched the
whole season cuz Matt would never watch
that stuff with me. Dude, sorry.
And I got married so young that I was
like, I have been out of reality TV for
a while.
You were 21? I was 21 from Unreal.
I was engaged at 19. That sounds even
crazier, right? Like
And was that just like y&#39;all been dating
for a long time? You were like, &#34;Let&#39;s
We did it for 3 years. We were like so
ready.&#34; Like
I I walked into college telling
literally.
We were telling every we&#39;re going to get
married at like for a long time.
Were y&#39;all doing YouTube stuff before
this? No, we waited till we got married,
which is we were like we&#39;re like we&#39;re
going to we&#39;re basically married now,
but we&#39;re going to be married. And like
what were we all doing before when y&#39;all
got married?
We were in we were in college and we
were uh we were both working part time
just so we could substitute afford to
get married cuz I was like we need to be
able to financially like pay for stuff
if we&#39;re going to get married.
but we definitely had moments. I even
remember the day of our rehearsal. I
freaked out in my parents kitchen. I was
like, &#34;Oh my gosh.&#34; I think the weight
of like that decision is so heavy.
You&#39;re like, &#34;Oh my gosh, did you have
any freakouts like the day before the
I didn&#39;t. I think we dealt with them all
love was like was the seal was the seal.
Yeah, we Yeah. Okay, but hold up. You
guys met and got married within 10
months. Like that that was quick. So
like the honeymoon stage that like that
feeling of like this person is perfect,
you know, like that that just that
infatuation. How long did that last?
Because I think from from our
experience, I want to say it was around
two years
that like I noticed that it like slowly
faded off and
of marriage.
Uh no no of just being together. So it
was before we got married that the
infatuation stage weirded off. How long
did the infatuation stage last for you
We&#39;re both very um emotional, passionate
people. So our first like probably four
months of of dating, we were just like
very feelings b like just like so riding
the high of like high school musical
love. I mean, just like, you know, and I
think the wakeup calls, like the
redeeming love premiere situation was
good, but then I feel like we just we
really walked through some hard stuff
with uh, you know, public just like hate
when we went public and dealing with a
lot of just like hate and criticism. Um,
his grandmother passing away, figuring
out platform, figuring out wealth, a lot
of stuff that just comes with that.
I got a I had a surgery that you had
you had a surgery like he had a hip
replacement as we were engaged like I
think a month out from our wedding. So
there was just there was a lot of like
really serious stuff that we walked
through. My my great-grandmother passed
away. So it was just like
it takes away the Yeah. It&#39;s like hey
are we going to do this or not? Like can
we can we go through hard things
together? And that&#39;s what it just kind
of burned it all away
cuz we say a lot you know I think it&#39;s
it&#39;s very easy to say like you know
marry your best friend get married to
the person that you know you have the
most fun with which is true like marry
your best friend. And like thinking
through the the thought process of like
who do I want to suffer with? Like life
is going to come with some really really
hard moments. And so, who&#39;s the person
not only that I want to laugh with and
have fun with, but who&#39;s going to be the
person that&#39;s going to like be stable
and steady and like a rock and someone
who&#39;s, you know, going to be there when
we&#39;re going through really, really hard
stuff. That&#39;s been huge for us, too, of
just like when you go through hard
things, like making sure we&#39;re leaning
on the right thing and turning to the
right thing. Um, and so we saw that
early on is like, yeah, who who do you
want to suffer with and who do you want
to walk through really hard things with?
Um, who do you want to like parent your
kids one day? Like we were just we we
very much saw it like we were definitely
dating with the intention to marry. So
it was like okay if our end goal is
marriage like you know our first few
months I feel like was the was the like
honey fun like high school and then it
and then we were like let&#39;s you know be
serious about this. Let&#39;s have the like
serious conversations if we&#39;re actually
you know going to do life together
forever. Like let&#39;s ask the hard stuff.
Um let&#39;s dig in. Let&#39;s really pray.
Let&#39;s bring in wise counsel. Let&#39;s ask
other people. Um what do you see on our
relationship? Were there any blind spots
that were overlooking? I think us both
having our own individual community and
mentorship was really important. Um
especially when you&#39;re talking about
like a fast-paced relationship, um
having those people in your life that
can kind of if if we were like out of
line, it&#39;s like, hey, well, maybe
consider this, you know? And we just had
a lot of people in our life that we
trusted that if they had been like, hey,
I don&#39;t think y&#39;all are ready to get
married. Like, you know, maybe we would
have hit the brakes for a second.
But it&#39;s also a different season of
life, right? Like if we would have done
that when we were 17, that&#39;s uh Maybe
even illegal. I don&#39;t know.
Yeah. Can you
like it? Probably depends on the state
Actually, I I know we have a friend that
got married when they were 17. So, I
think it is in some states it&#39;s legal.
Where do they live? Oh, it was in Utah.
Yeah. Utah makes sense.
My parents got married at 18. And both
of our parents uh had really short like
six month.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Like met, married all within like
six to eight months. So, we kind of like
just only made sense.
Yeah. Like, here we go. Yeah. That&#39;s
