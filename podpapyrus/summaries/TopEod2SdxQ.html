<li>Jennette McCurdy wrote a book titled "I'm Glad My Mom Died" exploring complicated parent-child relationships</li>
<li>She doesn't hate her mom but sees her as a complicated, nuanced person who was at times abusive</li>
<li>McCurdy felt relieved when her mom died, a feeling society doesn't accept discussing openly</li>
<li>Her mother always wanted to be an actress and put McCurdy in acting at age 6 to live vicariously through her</li>
<li>McCurdy was a child star on iCarly, appearing happy on camera while suffering trauma behind the scenes</li>
<li>Child star exploitation is more common than people want to admit, based on her audition experiences</li>
<li>She uses humor as a coping mechanism to process trauma, making difficult stories more readable</li>
<li>McCurdy spent 10 years in therapy working through her relationship with her mother</li>
<li>Her therapist advised dropping forgiveness as a goal, calling it "still trying to do your mom's work"</li>
<li>Society puts mothers on pedestals, making it taboo to criticize them unlike fathers</li>
<li>McCurdy was willing to face backlash because she felt the message was worth sharing</li>
<li>The book deals with the conflict between the idea of a "mom" versus one's actual mother</li>
<li>She's returned to entertainment as a director, writer, and podcaster - behind the camera this time</li>
<li>McCurdy worries about being sucked back into toxic entertainment industry patterns</li>
<li>She now has better tools and discernment to avoid getting lost in the industry whirlwind</li>
<li>Therapy and grounding practices help her stay connected to reality in entertainment environments</li>
<li>The book's success comes from addressing the taboo topic of unloving or harmful parental relationships</li>
<li>McCurdy trusts herself not to repeat past patterns because she's developed better coping mechanisms</li>

please welcome jeanette mccurdy
jeanette mccurdy welcome to the daily
show i feel so short my feet aren&#39;t
touching oh that&#39;s that&#39;s fine as long
as like you can you can swing them
around yeah it&#39;s as long as you enjoy it
oh yeah i can lower the desk as well if
you&#39;d like this this is good okay good
okay i can&#39;t actually do it i&#39;m glad you
asked me to do it um
welcome to the show and congratulations
on writing a book that i think for many
people is seen as
not just something funny not just a
story that&#39;s interesting but in many
ways a cathartic exploration of how we
see the relationships that we have with
many of our parents our caregivers
whoever it was in our world because you
wrote a book entitled i&#39;m glad my mom
and it is a massive
so two questions one
did you hate your mom and two
does everybody
[Laughter]
no i definitely don&#39;t hate my mom
think she&#39;s a really complicated and
nuanced person and i try to kind of
articulate her to the best of my ability
and all her many shades and colors to me
her humor is really
she could say things that were so
wild and at times abusive but she just
had a certain cadence and a rhythm that
was so humorous so i tried to capture
that um but i certainly didn&#39;t hate her
and i think
i think that&#39;s why it was so important
for me to write this book because
getting to the place where i was finally
glad and relieved that she was dead you
know it took me so long to be able to
accept that um
reality and i also think that&#39;s
something that people
you i didn&#39;t hear anybody talking about
i didn&#39;t hear anybody saying
you know that the sort of honest reality
of what their experience with their with
their parent was if they had a similar
one it feels like a thing that you can&#39;t
say because society doesn&#39;t accept it
it&#39;s just you have to keep moms on a
pedestal and we all have to have the
same experience and that just wasn&#39;t
mine so it felt even more important to
express it in the book you you go
through your entire journey many people
you know in america and some parts of
the world will remember you from icarly
you were this massive child star and on
the camera you were all smiles you made
people laugh everybody enjoyed what you
were doing
as soon as you read through the book you
realized you you were suffering you were
experiencing trauma it was really
abusive in in how you were doing what
you were doing it feels like in many
you were living your mom&#39;s dream and she
was making you do this
yeah i would love to know
how you did it like did you have a
switch did you have a did you
compartmentalize because you you talk
about it in the book but you could you
could never tell you could never tell on
screen what you were going through no no
so my mom always wanted to be an actress
her dream was to be
famous uh and she would recount sort of
these tales of how her parents wouldn&#39;t
let her she would camp out in front of
donny osmond&#39;s house bring him like
posters um chris knight who played peter
brady in a brady bunch she swore like oh
they had a relationship i think that was
not true
um chris knight if you&#39;re watching
please let me know if my mom actually
had a relationship with you
um but so she she was always fascinated
with kind of hollywood and the aura and
romance as she saw it and so she put me
in acting when i was six to kind of give
i think in my eyes it was to live
vicariously through me and to fulfill
her dream of what she had always wanted
but it seems like she subjected you to a
nightmare yes because you were in a
world where it&#39;s supposed to be fun you
know you&#39;re making kids television and
yeah and yet it it seems pretty horrible
i also wonder if this is the
relationship of many child stars or do
you know was this isolated or do you
think this is a lot more normal than
we&#39;d like to admit i think it&#39;s way more
common than anyone would care to admit i
know just from my experience of going
into auditions countless times i&#39;d have
like 103 feet for my mom would be having
me chug gatorade i&#39;d be walking to like
pretend to be a homeless child which is
just already so kind of messed up as it
is then there&#39;s these this you know
dozens of other girls lined up to also
try and be this homeless child and the
moms are like eyeing each other and like
oh i hope my daughter&#39;s better being
homeless than yours and it&#39;s like this
is so what is this world it&#39;s so weird
uh but i i am able to now kind of look
back and see the the humor in it i think
it is a very absurd reality but i do
think there&#39;s a lot of inherent um
ironic camera there i think what you&#39;ve
done in the book is precisely that
you&#39;ve looked back and you&#39;ve seen the
humor you you use the humor because this
book without the humor is a devastating
tale of a young child who is putting a
it really seems it would be so awful oh
my god that would be awful i think it
just would be it would be a lot harder
for people to read i think it would be
it would be painful because it is still
the real thing you know i i wouldn&#39;t
even think of it as a pity grab but but
the humor
is is is a coping mechanism it&#39;s a tool
you&#39;re processing your life through
there&#39;s a point in the book where i i
find myself
reading the stories of your mom yeah
understanding the complicated world that
she existed in yes but then wondering
you know like how you see her like like
did you forgive her were you able to let
it all go do you still do you still hold
some of those feelings like
what has your journey been oh my god
what a big good question that&#39;s such a
deep like this is what i spent 10 years
in therapy to be able to now say on the
daily show
that&#39;s so cool that&#39;s really awesome
um well i&#39;m glad you initially you know
you&#39;re speaking kind of the humor and i
do think it&#39;s a great coping mechanism
and and i don&#39;t i try not to use it as a
defense mechanism i use it that way for
a long time initially when i was first
kind of trying to grapple with
everything and i think that led to
really unfunny choices and my my sense
of humor is just sort of
overcompensatory and kind of flailing
and obnoxious to be honest um but i
think finding humor in those really
intense moments and that those tragedies
can bring gravity where it&#39;s necessary i
hope i&#39;ve done that um with my mom
i i haven&#39;t gotten to a place of
forgiveness and i was trying to get to a
place of forgiveness for so long in
therapy i would uh sort of
plead almost with my therapist like why
am i not able to get to this place what
is what&#39;s wrong with me that i&#39;m not
able to forgive my mom for this abuse
why am i so terrible that i can&#39;t get to
get to that place and she eventually
said you know jeanette what if you just
kind of dropped
uh forgiveness and didn&#39;t make that your
goal because that&#39;s you still trying to
do your mom&#39;s work
i couldn&#39;t yeah right i mean it that&#39;s
exactly my reaction i um to aaron yeah
wow yeah
it&#39;s um yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a journey that i
think far too many people have been i
think a lot of the success of the book
has been that obviously it&#39;s well
written obviously it&#39;s it&#39;s
fantastically told but it is a very
complicated topic how do you address
the lack of love or the lack of
parenting that you were supposed to get
from that figure because as you say mom
is supposed to be this this you know
this god this icon of everything dad in
some ways as well but not the same and
yet you&#39;re in a world where you&#39;re going
oh no it&#39;s true you know people be like
oh dad my dad was okay but mom is
untouchable or even with dads you can be
like oh my dad never showed up and we
were like oh my neither uh-huh and then
it&#39;s totally normal but i feel like with
moms it is very very much um this
there&#39;s this pedestal there on when you
when you broach this topic when you
started thinking about it were you
worried that people would turn on you
um i felt even if they did it was a
message worth sharing i really i really
mean that wow i love that thanks i
really do that&#39;s because that&#39;s a brave
stance to take because a lot of people
be like how dare you talk about your mom
like yes yeah it&#39;s actually
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so crazy how i mean
everything gets memified and you know
there was a there was a post i saw
online where someone was trying to
chastise everybody for talking about the
you know in like just going like we&#39;re
dead we&#39;re glad this monarchy is ending
in some way and someone was like replace
you think it&#39;s funny try and replace the
queen with your mom and see how funny it
is and someone put a picture of your
book up and then it was like i&#39;m glad
the queen died
and it feels like no but it feels like
that is
it feels like that&#39;s what the book is
dealing with is you dealing with the
idea of a mom
and how that how that competes or
conflicts with your actual mom yes oh my
that should be on the back flap
i can write it i wish you would
you&#39;ve shared your story with us
you&#39;ve gone through a world now you are
back in the world of entertainment in a
very different way you&#39;re behind the
camera you&#39;re directing you&#39;re writing
you&#39;ve got a podcast it&#39;s it&#39;s
interesting because it&#39;s a world that
was so toxic to you and now you&#39;ve come
back in a different way do you ever
worry that it may suck you back in and
how do you prevent yourself from going
back into that space of feeling like
you&#39;re defined by the everythingness
that you hated once oh my god i&#39;m i&#39;m so
can i just say i respect you so much i
this is so cool i&#39;m so happy to be here
truly like this is amazing thank you
very much um
i i have been scared of that there have
been a few times when i&#39;ve done some uh
some press that shall not be named where
it&#39;s so bizarre because i&#39;m like hearing
the pre-roll of you know they show like
the clip of me from the past or whatever
and and it&#39;s so dramatic it&#39;s like
mccurdy vanished from the spotlight
after her traumatic childhood with the
trauma and the devastating it&#39;s like
geez can we calm down
and then i&#39;m like walked out to this you
know to this like cold domineering kind
of set and then there&#39;s the journalist
and there&#39;s three inches of makeup on
the guy&#39;s face and it&#39;s just like
you know it does feel kind of
um it feels easy to lose sight of
reality in these environments and so i
really try to keep myself grounded and
stay on top of you know therapy and
being in touch with things that really
are good touchstones and grounding tools
for me because i do not want to um get
lost in it but also i will say i trust
that i won&#39;t i don&#39;t think i had the
tools before to not get lost in it and
to not feel
sort of caught up in the whirlwind of
but now i feel like you know what there
are some elements that are really cool
about it
like this and then there are some that
aren&#39;t and that&#39;s fine i can use my own
discernment and
and just be grateful for the good
experiences well we&#39;re grateful for you
thank you for having the book thank you
wonderful thank you so much thank you so
i&#39;m glad my mom died it&#39;s available now
whenever you buy a book jeanette mccarty
