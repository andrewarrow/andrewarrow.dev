Okay guys, we did it once. Can we do it
again and visit a city in just a few
Yeah, let&#39;s give it a shot today in
Welcome back fellow trollers,
backpackers, and friends. And today we
have just a few hours to discover as
much as we can of the beautiful city of
Tran. And starting with a lot of what we
can see just behind me is a city with a
lot of street art. Let&#39;s go with the
flow and enjoy this. And oh yeah, please
feel free to comment down below and
don&#39;t forget to subscribe.
Okay, so right now we are walking in
between the different street parks and
main attractions you can find in town.
So it may be a little noisy, but Trump
is actually kind of a big city and
mostly it&#39;s a hub means like not many
tourists stay there. They just come go
directly to the pier and grab a boat to
the islands where from here you can
directly go to porn guy which is pretty
famous our next step and some other
islands. So yeah
Okay, just
strolling inside
what is Ba
Bhutan Garden.
This is pretty nice. Unexpected. I was
walking I saw it on the map but it&#39;s
like in a regular street and suddenly
you arrive like in this garden like
type and um it&#39;s free so
never say no to a free attraction
and um it&#39;s okay it&#39;s not like
exceptional but if you like hours or if
you just want like a nice walk in the
shadows for five or 10 minutes,
that might be the place. Yeah.
Oh, look at this.
The famous Jordanian
Yeah. So,
just a little break and a little
interruption in our
express visit of the city.
As you can hear,
the rain is kicking in and yeah,
hopefully will not last you very long.
But you never know.
Uh tends to open in this region at this
time of the year.
Hopefully the end of the afternoon like
between 4 and 6 7
usually won&#39;t last long. But yeah,
I got a few street car to check. I
wanted to see the church and the temple,
but yeah, let&#39;s see if we have time.
It&#39;s still like 2 hours before night.
We&#39;ve been walking around for around 3
hours and uh yeah uh maybe a little more
I mean for half hour I didn&#39;t do
anything because of the rain. So
pretty much it I guess for what you can
see in train. Of course I&#39;m just saying
about the inner city and like really in
the center. I&#39;m not talking about Yeah.
cuz there&#39;s plenty to do around train. I
guess if you stick to the center of the
city there&#39;s not that much.
It&#39;s pretty
much parked and I guess it&#39;s more about
the vibe you get and walking and trying
some restaurants and like the smile of
the people. You can tell they they don&#39;t
see that many tourists like compared to
probably and I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s
nothing to do in train on the contrary
outside of the city. There are plenty of
caves. There&#39;s a pretty famous and that
I&#39;ve never been to, but I intend to in
the future national park. Uh, and of
course, it&#39;s the getaway door to all the
closest islands and some of the nicest
you can find around here. So, yeah,
people are so friendly here. Yeah, Trunk
has a lot to offer and a great vibe, I
guess you can say.
Even if not that many stuff in the
center area, you can still enjoy. If you
haven&#39;t stopped here for a few hours,
you can still walk around and I like the
architecture. It&#39;s like a lot of
colonial buildings and narrow streets
and plenty of markets, too.
Okay, guys. So, that&#39;s it for today and
this episode. I hope you enjoyed what we
saw and I guess we managed to see most
of the city in only 4 hours and even
less. If you like this content, please
comment down below, give it a thumbs up,
and I will see you on next episode.
Until then, take care and remember to
always just go with the pool. Bye-bye.
