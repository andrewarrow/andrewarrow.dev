<li>The actor did their own stunts, including being positioned on top of moving equipment</li>
<li>Reading the script was described as extremely stressful due to the intense content</li>
<li>Writers are praised for their incredible ability to weave information into exposition and stage directions</li>
<li>The script kept readers on edge and allowed them to visualize scenes clearly</li>
<li>There's a memorable scene involving a child character waving that helped resolve a situation</li>
<li>The actor had very limited character information initially - just a brief breakdown describing someone "fresh-faced, eager, innocuous but with something to hide"</li>
<li>The character's introduction involved helping others and giving a tip about a camera in a house</li>
<li>The actor felt unprepared and didn't understand their character when receiving new scripts</li>
<li>The actor actively sought information by cornering writers backstage for character insights</li>
<li>Writers remained secretive and wouldn't reveal character details</li>
<li>Other cast/crew members looked at the actor with fear, as if they were the character Todd</li>
<li>The actor was confused about why people seemed scared of them</li>
<li>Before shooting a crucial scene, the actor desperately asked director Vince for character guidance</li>
<li>Vince provided a metaphor about driving and encountering a raccoon in the road</li>
<li>The raccoon metaphor involved impossible choices: swerving right into a ditch or left into oncoming traffic</li>
<li>The metaphor represented the character's moral dilemmas and impossible situations</li>
<li>This raccoon metaphor served as the foundation for understanding Todd's character</li>
<li>The actor relied on this single piece of direction until the second season of the show</li>

you do your own stunts that&#39;s me yeah
but you were up there you were the I was
on top right yeah I love this this this
thing going up and down this damn thing
got my work cut end up takes CrossFit to
a whole new level yeah just reading this
script was the most stressful yeah
writers are just so incredible and I
don&#39;t know do they have a way of
dangling little bits of information even
in the exposition in the stage action
and you&#39;re just on the edge of your seat
reading it you you could see it so
clearly how this this this is just when
I read it&#39;s just poor little kid doing
this little way I remember him just keep
waving and look you solve the situation
yeah you&#39;re welcome yeah you really
saved our asses all I had to base the
character on was a tiny little breakdown
that was attached to that seem that I
was telling about that I auditioned with
which said he&#39;s like fresh-faced eager
innocuous but with something to hide
that was all I had and then I had this
other scene and then the first episode
where he&#39;s introduced he&#39;s just sort of
helping out he helps he gives him a tip
about a camera in this house and then I
got this script and was just thinking
holy SH like how am I supposed to do
this without any understanding of who
this guy is and I was just saying
backstage I was cornering every writer
and get something out of him yeah and no
one would say anything but they wouldn&#39;t
look at me as if I were Todd so that
they were looking at me really scared
and I had no idea why and then right
before we shot that scene I said Vince
you have to give me something I have no
idea what I&#39;m doing or who this guy is
and what did he say what did he give you
he said like you know when you&#39;re
driving and a raccoon runs out in front
of your car and if he swerved to the
right you you run to the ditch if you
swerved to the left you hit an oncoming
car like well what do you do yeah that
is until the second season that was kind
of the foundation for Todd
