the the mood music about history, which
I agree in the last, let&#39;s say, 15
years, has been intensely moralistic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that wrong? Like, should we not be
trying to learn the moral lessons from
the past?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The biggest killers were utopian
idealists. They were people who believed
in a better world. Hitler undoubtedly,
you know, it sounds weird to say it, but
he&#39;s an idealist. Stalin is obviously an
idealist. Mau is an idealist. They think
they are going to make a better world.
We now have a slightly
sanitized and um self-deluding
idealistic view of human nature and of
what we&#39;re capable of. They&#39;ve been
completely insulated from the beast and
other people and in themselves.
Knowledge of the beast is is so
important.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dominic Samra, welcome to trigonometry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you for having me. It&#39;s a great
privilege. It&#39;s an honor to be here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, it&#39;s an honor for us to have you.
You&#39;re of course part of the hugely
successful the rest is history podcast
with our former and future guest Tom
Holland. Uh and history has always been
a fascination of ours. our audience love
our history episodes. So, it&#39;s great to
have you here. Uh the thing we wanted to
talk about with you is I think given the
current political climate and everything
else that&#39;s been going on, a lot of
people are kind of aware of the fact
that the way history&#39;s been taught for
quite some time now has produced people
who see a history, our history, the
history of the West, the history of much
of the world really, in very
one-dimensional, black and white, quite
moralizing terms.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And what we wanted to explore with
you is a you know how that was generated
and perhaps fill in some of the blanks
and the gaps and you know contextualize
and add the nuance that I think history
always requires. So first of all how do
we how do we get here?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a good question. Um I think it&#39;s
not so much actually about how history
is taught but it&#39;s how we talk about
history more generally. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so I do a lot of um uh talks in schools,
events in schools um uh to sort of
promote history and whatnot. And I&#39;m
actually always struck by how
enthusiastic the teachers are, how um
committed to history uh but also how
little time they have. So they have very
little time. A lot of children will only
do history for two hours a week, let&#39;s
say, or two 40 minute um sessions. So
there&#39;s not they&#39;re not covering a huge
amount of ground, first of all. Um, but
I think the actual the the mood music
about history, which I agree in the
last, let&#39;s say, 15 years has been
intensely moralistic. I&#39;m certainly
compared with when I was growing up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; By the way, before you get into that,
maybe the right question, is that wrong?
Like, should we not be trying to learn
the moral lessons from the past? Is it
just like evil reactionaries like the
three of us who are like, you know, we
can&#39;t judge people by the new standards?
And are we wrong to be moralistic about
history? No, it&#39;s a that&#39;s a very good
point and not necessarily, right? There
have often been ages where people were
very moralistic about history. So, for
example, if you went back to lots of
people watching this, if they are evil
reactionists will say, &#34;Oh, we should be
just like the Victorians.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Victorians were intensely moralistic
about history. And they really did tell
it as heroes and villains. So, there&#39;s
always been a tendency within history, I
think, to see it as um black and white,
you know, goodies and badies,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and that goes back as long as people
have been writing history at all. So,
you know, if you read, I don&#39;t know, uh,
Roman historians, let&#39;s say, my
co-presenter&#39;s favorite subjects,
Tacitus, Sutonius or something, those
um, those accounts are very moralistic.
You know, you&#39;ve got bad emperors and
good emperors. Um, and often there&#39;s not
much nuance when you&#39;re talking about
Caligula or Nero or whoever it might be.
But I think when I was um doing history,
so let&#39;s say the 1980s, 1990s,
the the the general discourse I suppose
was not terribly judgmental. So in other
words, there was a there was no premium
placed. There was no great value placed
on you saying, &#34;Well, this person is a
terrible person and I want to tear them
down and I want to, you know, diminish
them and this person, everyone has said
this person is a great Florence
Nightingale or whoever it might be and
actually they&#39;re a terrible person.&#34; I
think there was um an awareness that
we&#39;re all terrible people and so it&#39;s
not actually a very interesting
conversation to have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I was quite conscious when I was um
doing my PhD and whatnot uh in the late
90s early 2000s I did American history
so listening to a lot of people coming
from America that there was a new mood
coming in actually from America I think
a lot of this has come from the US um
which was much more moralistic which
which was much more about I mean there&#39;s
a very famous example in the early 1990s
a huge argument about Thomas Jefferson
had heathered children with his slave
Sally Hemings and therefore should
Jefferson effectively be canceled people
didn&#39;t use that terminology then but
that that conversation was already
happening and that was a sort of
harbinger I think of what was to come in
the 2000s then obviously even more so in
the 2010s and then 2020 the kind of high
point of it the Black Lives Matter kind
of George Floyd statue toppling moment.
Um, and for people of a slightly older
generation like me, that&#39;s very
disconcerting because I had grown up
thinking, you know, very much history is
warts and all, but that doesn&#39;t mean,
you know, you you are open about
violence and cruelty and all those
things that happened in the past, but
you don&#39;t set yourself up as a hanging
judge. Um, and I think it&#39;s a question
of tone actually.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s not a question of what the story is
that you&#39;re telling, but it&#39;s how you
tell it. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so in other words anybody who wrote
about the British Empire to give you an
example anyone who wrote about the
British Empire from the moment that it
was happening knew that there was a lot
of violence right they knew that when
the Indian mutiny happened and the
British reestablished their authority
that there were reprisals and they fired
people out of cannons and all of that
kind of thing. But for a long time when
people told that story they sort of
said, well obviously the reprisals and
very terrible things happened and there
was a lot of savagery and blah blah blah
blah. You know that&#39;s not surprising
because that&#39;s how people behave in
history. But I think what changed was
the tone with which people describe
those events. So suddenly instead of
saying you know it&#39;s very the grim
things happen in history. History is
often very dark. So be it people there
was a lot of suddenly then a weeping and
wailing and nashing of teeth and this is
terrible. How could this have happened?
we should tear down the the plaques to
these people blah blah blah blah almost
as though people were indignant and
affronted and surprised that that
something so terrible could have
happened in history whereas I when I
approach history think of course people
behave selfishly greedily you know
sadistically because that&#39;s in us we
would be no different and it&#39;s not our
place or it&#39;s actually it&#39;s not even
it&#39;s not our place it&#39;s a bit boring to
say oh gosh Well, I&#39;m so terribly moral
and these people are so immoral and they
live there in the Gothic compared with
me. It&#39;s obviously I think that&#39;s a
really foolish way to think about human
nature and a slightly it&#39;s a very
egotistical and self-promoting and
pompous way to talk about yourself as
opposed to the people who are your
predecessor.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I would almost say that it&#39;s a
denial of human nature. Um, what what&#39;s
interesting to me though is how why you
think that tendency has happened. I
mean, one of the things we might blame
is the fact that we&#39;ve had this massive
period of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I use inverted commas when I say peace,
but really if you live in the west,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if you&#39;ve not voluntarily enlisted to go
and fight other than the war in Vietnam,
which was many, many decades ago now,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you&#39;ve never really had to be confronted
with the reality that if you even I walk
around London, we&#39;re sitting here in the
heart of London,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; almost every monument is to do with war.
Yeah. And yet no one in our almost
essentially the three generations that
anybody will know themselves, their
parents and their grandparents has any
experience of that really in the west at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that why?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I completely agree with you. Sorry
it&#39;s very boring for you to have a guest
on the podcast who just tells you that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it&#39;s great. It just my ego gets
bigger and bigger. That&#39;s what we do. We
bring experts on to make ourselves feel
agree with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean that is the podcast model. Let&#39;s
be frank. I mean we don&#39;t actually do
that but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a pleasant
change from arguing with idiots.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No but I do completely agree with you. I
I think what we uh have lost is uh
somebody described it as a sense of the
tragic. So for example we no longer have
politicians with a sense of the tragic
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a sense of how um how close we always
are to the precipice as it were but not
just actually to the precipice as in
terms of you know our civilization could
fall apart. a load of people would turn
up in our village and kind of burn all
the houses down and and rape and ravage
and behave really badly, but also how
close we are to the beasts within
ourselves as it were. Now, I think if
people who had been who lived in
societies that were geared for war and
where war was a fairly regular
occurrence,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that would not be surprising. In other
words, I mean, you just think about it
in term, you don&#39;t have to go very far
back in history. So, go back to let&#39;s
say the first half of the last century.
You&#39;ve got two world wars. You have in
central and eastern Europe endless
little conflicts in the 1920s and 1930s.
You know, if you&#39;re really unlucky and
you&#39;re living in what&#39;s now Eastern
Poland or Bellarus or Western Ukraine,
you know, the borders are changing every
few years. Endless pograms, ethnic
cleansing, all of this kind of thing. I
mean, those are people who really do
have a sense of the tragic because they
know that things can change with
dizzying speed. in a couple of years,
the people who you&#39;ve relied on all your
life, who are your neighbors, may turn
on you and try to kill you. And I think
what&#39;s clearly happened is that we now
have a slightly um sanitized and um
self-deluding idealistic view
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of human nature and of what we&#39;re
capable of. And a great example of this
from the period that I&#39;ve written about
is the way that people thought about war
and war crimes. Um so for example in the
Falklands war in the 1980s so the
Falklands war by the standards of wars
is a really really clean war. It&#39;s being
fought over islands where only a tiny
population live. The two groups of
people who are fighting over the islands
the Argentines and the British most of
them have never been to the islands
before. So it doesn&#39;t feel personal for
them. They&#39;re almost fight. It&#39;s as
though they&#39;re fighting kind of they&#39;ve
agreed neutral territory and they&#39;re
fighting on this neutral territory.
there are no war crimes against
civilians because the civilian
population is so small. So actually it&#39;s
a sort of in a vertigas a fair fight.
But after that war um happened about
let&#39;s say eight or nine years later when
servicemen started to write their
memoirs they would describe things like
for example cutting off ears of uh enemy
soldiers who had been killed as
souvenirs. I mean, it sounds lots of
people watching this will be like, &#34;Wow,
that&#39;s pretty horrific, right?&#34; That you
would take a trophy or or posing for
photos with dead bodies.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Those kinds of things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that a war crime?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, people, I guess, can make up
their own mind about that. But here&#39;s
the thing. When that was first reported,
oh whoa, oh, what terrible behavior. How
could we have behaved so badly? This is
unbelievable. We have to have
investigations. And then furious
arguments, other people say, no, that
didn&#39;t happen at all. But actually, if
you read any account of previous wars,
anybody who&#39;d fought in previous wars
would say, I mean, as grim as this is,
this is pretty standard stuff. You know,
Canadian soldiers at D-Day were
notorious for I want I mean, the tourist
is a very loaded word. They were well
known for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; famous
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for, you know, the bit taking people
taking ears, taking trophies, for being
really kind of, you know, they were
pretty hardcore. Now, because it&#39;s World
War II, it&#39;s the good war. We don&#39;t make
it to great fuss about it. But these
things happen in wars. And people who
had fought in previous wars were
unsurprised by the reports coming from
the fools. They were like, &#34;Come on,
this is what happens. You train young
men to fight, you know, to do the most
savage thing possible to kill an other
young men.&#34; And that line is always
going to be a little bit more gray and a
bit slippery than we would like. Let&#39;s
not, you know, be pearl clutching about
this. But I think what that reaction
suggests and of course the reaction to
what&#39;s happened since and stories coming
out of Afghanistan or Iraq or whatever
is that probably we have we we like our
uh confident now very sanitized you know
we like it kind of um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with drones.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Right. Exactly. We like it at a
distance. We like to shy away from the
kind of that the handtohand the the
physical nature of it I guess. And that
goes back to your point about we have
been incredibly fortunate to grow up in
an age of peace and you know lots of
people now have lived and died in this
country or in the west more generally.
They&#39;ve had the dream they&#39;ve been
completely insulated from the beast in
other people and in themselves. So
they&#39;ve kind of lost lost sight of that
I suppose.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I love the fact that you use the phrase
warts and all which is famously Oliver
Cromwell. Yeah. when asked when a
painter asked how he should have his
portrait painted, he famously said,
&#34;Paint me Wartson all.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And actually that&#39;s he&#39;s a fascinating
figure because on the one hand with
Cromwell, you talk to my Irish family
for example and you can&#39;t hear anything
but you know exploitive laden invective
from them rightly so. And on the other
hand, father of democracy in this
country etc etc. But what&#39;s really
interesting is how we can&#39;t seem to
accept that people like Com, great
figures of history, have this duality to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you&#39;re right. I mean, I think
Churchill is a good example of this as
well, right? That people will say, &#34;Oh,
yes, Churchill, I know you say he saved
democracy from Nazism, but he said some
very cool things about Indians.&#34; You
know, people are complicated. And I
think anybody who thinks at all
seriously about human nature or about um
even the characters that you meet in
great literature or something. You don&#39;t
even have to think about the people that
you know. You know that people are
capable of um tremendous things but also
terrible things. I mean Cromwell I think
is what the most fascinating character
in all um English and British history.
Um he&#39;s uh much more complicated than
people think. He&#39;s actually much more
funloving than people think. By the way,
he didn&#39;t ban Christmas. Uh it&#39;s not
Cromwell who bans it. It&#39;s Anyway, we
don&#39;t need to get into all that. But
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, Cromwell uh can be a very savage
character. You know, when he&#39;s
commanding at some of his later battles,
people describe him kind of laughing as
though he&#39;s drunk. you know, he&#39;s seized
with this kind of marshall spirit and a
sense that that actually we might find
very unsettling now that he&#39;s doing
God&#39;s work and his opponents are God&#39;s
enemies and therefore they will be, you
know, he will sigh through them as
though through chaff or whatever. Um, so
that side of Cromwell you lots of people
might find very unsettling. And yet on
the other hand, he&#39;s somebody who
wrestles with his conscience, wrestles
with what he thinks is is God&#39;s plan,
uh, feels himself unworthy. You know,
one of the reasons in the 1650s after he
basically he&#39;s he&#39;s got effectively
supreme power and he wrestles with this
issue about whether he should take the
crown or not, it&#39;s, you know, would that
be too arrogant? Is that what God wants
for me? Am I good enough? All of that
kind of thing. You know, most dictators
don&#39;t think like that. Most dictators
can&#39;t wait to get their hands on the
ground. So, I think Cromwell&#39;s a
fascinating character and he&#39;s a really
good example of somebody who, you know,
there&#39;s a statue of him just down the
road from us outside the um Palace of
Westminster because, as you say, he is
seen as one of the you know, the people
in the in the Victorian period in the
late Victorian period saw him as one of
the great heroes of democracy in this
country. Would I like to see I&#39;m I&#39;ve
got an Irish wife. Would I like to see
Cromwell statue taken down? Absolutely
not. Um because I think as with all
statues, it&#39;s a testament to a
particular time period that in which it
was put up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um but also because I think big it&#39;s
good that people know about big
complicated figures like that and they
appreciate precisely your point about WS
and all. I think that&#39;s true of
Churchill. It&#39;s true of Cromwell. to
true of almost all of the what we would
think of as an invert in inverted commas
great characters in history. They&#39;re
always more complicated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely. And in particular, let&#39;s
look at the British Empire because as
someone who has a South American
background, I actually find it
infuriating when people talk about the
British Empire and they&#39;re like, &#34;This
is the most evil empire that&#39;s ever
lived.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Compared to what? the
Belgians in Congo. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Spanish Empire, the Portuguese.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It smacks not only of ignorance, it
smacks of a certain type of arrogance as
well that the British are, you know, not
only did we have the greatest empire,
but we were also the most evil. The most
evil. I&#39;m like, really?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tremendous
self-absorption. And actually, it&#39;s
something that we share actually with
our American cousins. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know they love to no coup can happen
anywhere in the world but the CIA&#39;s
fingerprints aren&#39;t all over it
according to kind of you know very ultra
liberal kind of American commentators
you know indigenous people or people in
foreign countries never have any agency
it&#39;s always got to be the evil American
puppet masters who have done it and as
you say with the British Empire there&#39;s
a there&#39;s a narcissism about some of the
commentary about it which is kind of we
have to be the most evil everything must
be our fault conflicts in the 21st
century because we drew the boundar
boundaries in the wrong places all of
this kind of thing. Now on empires more
generally um my view on empires is
actually very simple that empire is the
natural unit of human organization.
There are others of course
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and we live in an age now where lots of
people watching this will think of the
nation state as the most
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sort of obvious and natural model but no
model is really natural.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But empires for most people who&#39;ve lived
and died lived and died in empires of
one kind or another. You know China
effectively now is an empire. The United
States is obviously a empire, not merely
continental empire across its North
America. But internationally,
having an empire is in itself, I think,
not illegitimate. It&#39;s the way that most
people have been ruled. It&#39;s the way
that the Romans or the Persians or
whoever the Ottomans organized their
societies. Um, one group dominating
another again is not unnatural. It&#39;s the
norm in human history. I think what
makes the British Empire quite really
interesting and really unusual is that
right from the beginning it has the
seeds of its own dissolution in it
because it one of the things it it
exports is the idea of you know the rule
of law liberal democracy all of those
kinds of things. So from the beginning
the British Empire is is kind of an an
internal argument. There are always
people lots of people in Britain who
don&#39;t like the idea of colonization and
of um dominance and so on. There always
ferocious arguments about it and you
know some of the British Empire&#39;s most
well-known celebrated critics Gandhi a a
great example. These are people who are
profoundly shaped by British
institutions,
uh, British traditions, by the British
idea of British ideas of fairness and
freedom and all of those kinds of
things, the kind of rhetoric of liberty,
if you like. That&#39;s not to say, of
course, there&#39;s d there&#39;s elements of
hypocrisy and greed and all of these
things in the British Empire as they&#39;re
all are in all human phenomena, all
human institutions. But I mean to to go
back to your point about you know the
Belgians, Portuguese, the Spanish and so
on. If you had you know it&#39;s a bit like
um the philosopher kind of John Rules&#39;s
famous sort of conceit which is you know
if you could choose if you had to make a
blind choice and you didn&#39;t know how
rich you were going to be. You didn&#39;t
know what you going to look like but
where would you choose to kind of start
again and you had to choose an empire a
European colonial empire in which to do
it. I think the British Empire would be
a pretty good place to choose. I mean,
it&#39;s definitely not the Belgian Congo,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s not, you know, you&#39;re not in Mexico
in the 19 in the 1520s kind of ravaged
by smallbox with Cortez and the
concistadors rampaging around um uh what
becomes Mexico City. So, yeah, I I think
um I think the British Empire, it&#39;s it&#39;s
clearly not the most evil empire in
history. It&#39;s not dedicated to
extermination or to um or to violence in
the way that the Third Reich is or
whatever. So those comparisons that you
see quite a lot nowadays, especially
online, just strike me as as utterly
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, they are. And and one of the
things that also bothers me about this
and you you mentioned you know uh
Central America for example there is
this sort of idea that you know
everyone&#39;s living peacefully and singing
kumbaya and holding hands and then these
evil Europeans arrived and like started
being violent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like that not entirely my reading of the
attemp empires. Exactly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do you know do you know what I mean?
like all you know the more I read about
the Native Americans in North America I
s suddenly figure out they&#39;re not really
they weren&#39;t really you know they
weren&#39;t really that peaceful or or
loving or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; no no there are very simplistic ways of
talking about this so even the
distinction between indigenous people
and European colonizers is wrong because
often say to give the example of uh the
Aztecs the Aztecs had come from
somewhere else they were they were armed
migrants or you might call them
colonizers themselves they come from
probably from what&#39;s now roughly what&#39;s
now Colorado. They&#39;d come south. They
subjugated people around them. They ran
this empire. You know, they did
sacrifice people to the gods. They did
all these kind of things in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; huge numbers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They were no strangers. Exactly. They
were no strangers to violence. Now,
that&#39;s not to say they&#39;re terrible
villains and the Europeans are great
saints. Um they&#39;re they&#39;re both
complicated societies capable of all the
extremes of human nature. I think that&#39;s
my approach. It&#39;s not it&#39;s not to say,
you know, because I&#39;ve written about the
Aztecs for in the book for children.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um it&#39;s not to say
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you probably have to sanitize that a
fair bit, I&#39;d imagine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually, no. No, not at all. Cuz kids
love the violence.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, they do. When I taught the Aztecs
at school, the kids loved it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, of course. I I Why would that be
worrying? That&#39;s normal. Kids,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if if you&#39;re standing in front of uh 40
10 year olds and you know, you&#39;ve got 40
minutes, if you&#39;re not careful, they
will be very bored very quickly. And the
best way to keep them interested is to,
you know, every few moment, every few
minutes, punctuate it with somebody
having his heart ripped out or, you
know, Henry VII having an enema or any
of these kinds of details, these kind of
grim, gory details that stick in kids&#39;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They love it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They love it. Of course, they love it
because people are fascinated, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In many ways, kids are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; human beings at their most unseasoned.
Well, not in many ways, that very
obvious. They&#39;re most raw and
unseasoned, right? And kids are f Why do
kids love gladiators?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, they&#39;re they they&#39;re not
really interested in Roman baths or in
Roman law codes. What they like is the
coliseum and basically people, you know,
gouging each other&#39;s eyes out and
whatnot because kids, like all of us,
they&#39;re kind of voyers when they look at
history and they they love the extremes.
I think that&#39;s completely normal and
natural. And you know, I&#39;m not saying we
should completely pander to it and sink
into the kind of pornography of violence
when we talk about history, but it&#39;s
self-deluding, I think, to pretend that
that&#39;s not why people are often
interested in history in the first
place. You when I fell in love with
history when I was very small,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it was knights, battles, kings and
queens, executions, all of these kinds
of things. If you had said to me, &#34;No,
actually, um, little Dominic, age seven
or something, it&#39;s much better for you
to learn about the suffragettes and the
struggle for equal rights and all of
these.&#34; You know, how many people are
really going to be that enthusiastic
about history? That&#39;s not to completely
dismiss those subjects and say, &#34;Don&#39;t
do them later on.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But what gets you into history is is is
narrative conflict.

Give me one minute to tell you about
Senolytics and why they&#39;re being called
the biggest discovery of our time for
promoting healthy aging and enhancing
your physical prime as a middle-aged
man. Middle-aged man who wrote this
script. Look, we all have big goals, but
let&#39;s be honest, the aging process isn&#39;t
our friend when it comes to endless
energy and productivity. That&#39;s why I
use Qualiaenolytic. As we age, everyone
accumulates senicent cells, also known
as zombie cells. These old worn out
cells cause symptoms of aging like
aches, slow recovery, and sluggish
energy. They take up space and nutrients
from healthy cells. Much like pruning
dead leaves off a plant, qualioenolytic
removes these senocent cells, allowing
healthy cells to thrive, and you only
need to take it 2 days a month. The
formula is non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free,
and designed to maximize the combined
effects of its ingredients. Plus, it
comes with a 100-day money back
guarantee. Since I&#39;ve started using
Qualia, I felt more energetic, more
productive, and my girlfriend tells me
I&#39;m now somewhat mostly bearable. Just a
little joke, don&#39;t have a girlfriend.
Plus, those middle-aged aches and pains
virtually gone. Resist aging at the
cellular level and try Qualia Senolytic.

So I interrupted you when you were
saying you wrote the book about Aztecs
for kids.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Oh yes you did. Yeah. So I felt
with that that um you know you have two
sort of complicated societies. You have
um a conquest that actually is is is
very again very nuanced and very
complicated because it&#39;s actually not
the Spanish just conquering Mexico. The
Spanish have loads of um they they
actually have far there are far more the
great battles. There are far more
indigenous misoamerican soldiers on the
Spanish side than there are Spaniards,
right? There are internal struggles.
There&#39;s internal dissension. The this is
a clash of empires,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a clash of colonizers if you like. So to
see it really simplistically is these
guys are the good guys, these guys are
the bad guys. Now that&#39;s obviously how
people initially told the story when it
was told from the European perspective.
Now the trend is to completely do it the
other way and to say that everything
about the Spanish or other European
colonizers is terrible and they&#39;re
greedy and they&#39;re they don&#39;t really
care of their Christianity is just a
pretext for their sort of ruthless
mercenary ambitions. I think that&#39;s just
as simplistic as the old stories.
Whereas the kind of Aztec slavering
covered in blood and the Spanish kind of
noble Christian warriors, they&#39;re both
really sort of silly ways to talk about
history, I would say. And I I always
remember uh when I was in Venezuela
being pinned against the wall by what my
uncle&#39;s friend who told me and in great
detail about how Francis Drake was a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a pirate. And uh I was like, well, I&#39;m
kind of 7 years old, mate. I don&#39;t
really understand what you want me to do
with this information. Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but it was a very powerful lesson for me
cuz it made me understand the way that I
see Sir Francis Drake and I was taught
in school to a Latin American he was a
pirate, a plunderer, a thief on a mass
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I think it&#39;s
a fascinating um these lessons are
really good actually. So you mentioned
Cromwell. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I was Irish I undoubtedly would have
a very dim view of Oliver Cromwell. I&#39;m
not so I don&#39;t you know it&#39;s not that
complicated. people always um you know
looking at historical characters you
always have to be conscious of where
you&#39;re standing right where I&#39;m standing
where you&#39;re standing will always be
different places just because you know
not because of any differences between
us but nobody can be exactly where you
are no coming to it with the baggage
that you have and I think actually
instead of you know these people get
into really frenzid and fierce arguments
which to my mind are actually
unnecessary it&#39;s completely reasonable
that people have different views about
characters in the past and the idea that
you that one view must dominate that it
becomes intolerable for anybody to say
well actually I quite like Winston
Churchill I mean that&#39;s obviously
ridiculous you know Winston Churchill
sure I understand I completely get that
if you&#39;re an an Indian historian you&#39;re
going to look at different aspects of
Churchill&#39;s life and career that will
jump out to you and and you know you may
regard him as objectionable that&#39;s fine
I don&#39;t need to to persuade you will
silence you. You say your own thing. But
I think it&#39;s completely reasonable that
people in Britain see Churchill as the
incarnation of the bulldog spirit, as
the symbol of patriotism, as the symbol
of winning the Second World War or those
kinds of things. Why wouldn&#39;t we? I
mean, it&#39;d be weird if we didn&#39;t. And
it&#39;s also as well acknowledging the fact
that when you&#39;re dealing with these
seismic figures who changed history in
such a profound way, they&#39;re going to
change history in ways that are you
perceive to be good, but also other
people will perceive to be bad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Of course. And and and to
take that on a little bit, um it&#39;s mad
to think that other to reward people in
history purely because they agree with
you. In other words,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to celebrate only the people who who
mirror your own um prejudices and
preconceptions, right? So, in other
words, to look back at the 18th century
to say, &#34;Well, so and so is obviously a
good person because they believed in
equality like me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But this person who appears to be very
interesting and civilized and what not
is actually a terrible person because
they invested in the slave trade or
whatever it might be. We can be
horrified by the slave trade and think
that slavery is wrong and all those
kinds of things, but people, you&#39;ve got
to grant people in the past their own
agency, their own space, their own their
difference, I guess, and and sort of and
respect their difference. I guess
respect the fact that they
their moral world, their mental world,
the baggage they&#39;re carrying with them
is completely different from ours. And
of course, what I always say, especially
when I&#39;m in schools actually, and this
always makes the children kind of go,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is to say, &#34;You&#39;re not the end.&#34; Like,
there will be people who come after you,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; who will say, &#34;You were bonkers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and immoral and wrong, and why couldn&#39;t
you see that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; eating meat is morally wrong or getting
on an airplane is, you know, all
whatever.&#34; All these kinds of things
that the kids will take for granted,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a bright picture of the future
you&#39;re painting there, maybe.
Well, you know, I really realized I was
in Isbekistan recently and they have
these giant statues of Tim. They call
him Tim Khan. He&#39;s called Tamil, but
they don&#39;t like that cuz that&#39;s Tim the
Basically making fun of a disabled
person at this point, right? But I if
you actually look at what he did
dayto-day, right? This is a guy that
every time he had an opportunity, he&#39;d
go and invade somewhere, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kill all the men, the women, whatever,
right? come back home and then he&#39;d go
and hunt and kill animals to chill out.
This is and that was basically what you
did. And that was the way that these
people thought. And when I thought about
that, I just went, &#34;Well, this person&#39;s
brain worked so differently to me and to
anyone I am ever likely to meet. These
are different people. Like they think
differently. The whole world view is
different.&#34; Um, but I guess where it
leaves me, Dominic, and it comes back to
what you&#39;re saying is a question about
the truth then, because you go, well,
you know, everyone&#39;s everyone&#39;s got
their own perspective. Everyone&#39;s
standing in their own place, and now
you&#39;ve got these morons on the internet
going, well, actually, Winston Churchill
is the greatest villain of World War II.
And that just isn&#39;t true. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that&#39;s not cuz they&#39;re standing in a
different place. It&#39;s just cuz they&#39;re
they&#39;re wrong.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
Unless they are standing in Adolf
Hitler&#39;s place, in which point maybe
they do. Do you see where I&#39;m getting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I do completely. It&#39;s a really
difficult one actually. Um uh and it&#39;s
one that uh I kind of wrestle with a
little bit. Like is there such a thing
as historical truth? M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think to some extent, you know, the
conversation that we&#39;ve been having,
you&#39;ll probably be appalled by this, but
to some extent, all of us living in the
21st century are postmodernists to the
extent that we all recognize that there
can be different accounts of something
that are all equally correct or all
equally flawed, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Equally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think I don&#39;t recognize that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I think you probably do because I
think you and I I think you do without
knowing it. In other words, that you and
I you might you might have a take on
history, right? Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I might have a slightly different
take on history. A slightly different
take on history.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and we would say, well, we&#39;re
probably not going to agree on this, but
I can see where you&#39;re coming from and
where you say it, and they&#39;re probably
both reasonable narrative accounts of
what happened. In other words, just to
give you a tiny really petty and trivial
example. If we were both writing
accounts of this conversation
afterwards,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we might write different accounts, but
they might both be right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, in other words, what&#39;s the true
account of our conversation?
even the the footage that you&#39;re doing
right now depending on the camera you
choose to they might say well actually
the camera didn&#39;t pick up that bit of
nuance that was kind of lost on you
right so it&#39;s hard
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or the conversation that happened before
we started or whatever so it&#39;s actually
hard to it&#39;s very hard to get at what
the truth yeah about that now that was a
really exciting conversation um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s really hard to get at what that
truth would be however
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; at the same time as saying that so in
other words we can sort of see that you
can have lots of competing accounts
that all have some validity. So
otherwise there would you know you would
be able to write the definitive history
book on the crusades and nobody would
ever write a book on the crusades again
because that person would have published
the truth. Okay, that will clearly never
happen. There will always be lots of
different books on the crusades. People
will ask different questions. People
will see different things. It doesn&#39;t
mean the others are wrong and untrue,
but you can have competing versions,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but you can&#39;t then what you obviously I
think most historians would say is what
you don&#39;t want to do is open the door
and say, &#34;Well, they&#39;re all equally
valid or invalid.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was the reason I disagree with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because obviously that&#39;s not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because if I retold this conversation
as, you know, a 644 black man came sat
sat down and we started talking about
geography. It&#39;s not true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s just factually correct.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. Exactly. So to give you an
example of the crusades of the second
world war, I think it&#39;s we could say
there are many different accounts that
are often wildly different, but they&#39;re
all valid and they&#39;re all uh valuable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But then there are some accounts that
are not valid and valuable. So there is
a dividing line between truth and
untruth, right? So in other words,
Second World War, there are lots of
different books on the Second World War
seeing it from different perspectives.
Some that say,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I could write a book on the Second World
War saying a tremendous victory for
democracy and freedom, blah blah blah. A
Polish historian could write a book on
the Second World War that says, &#34;Well,
hold on. We ended up being conquered by
Stalin. Stalin&#39;s the big winner of the
Second World War, not Churchill, blah
blah blah blah blah blah.&#34; You know, you
can have different accounts that you
could say, &#34;Yeah, I can understand where
you&#39;re coming from. That&#39;s valid. That&#39;s
also valid. It&#39;s good to have different
opinions.&#34; Like people always people
always do that about all kinds of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but there has to be a dividing line. I
think that&#39;s what most academic
historians or scholars would say. There
has to be a point where you say hold on
you know they didn&#39;t just sit there and
talk about geography you know that there
is there is right and there is wrong and
this is what obviously has become more
and more slippery in the last 20 years
or so. to the examples you&#39;re picking
up, you know, people who are um getting
a lot of traction sometimes going on
shows like this or on podcasts or
whatever, saying actually, you know,
Hitler is the is the great victim of the
Second World War and Churchill is the
villain. All of this kind of stuff,
right? I think historians clearly have a
duty to say, &#34;No, you&#39;re just wrong.
There is such a thing as fact.&#34; I guess
it&#39;s truth is a very loathe word. I
guess accuracy is maybe a more useful
word in that context. Say that&#39;s just
not accurate. It&#39;s just not correct. Um
Churchill clearly is not the villain of
the Second World War. Britain did not
force Hitler into war. All of these
kinds of things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I think it&#39;s slightly more
complicated than to say true untrue. I
think you can still have disagreements.
You can still have competing versions.
But what has happened I think because
basically the technological change it&#39;s
a bit like the invention of the printing
press in the 16th century
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; technological change means that suddenly
it&#39;s like the ground beneath your feet
has become unstable. You don&#39;t know what
to trust. There are loads of competing
um versions of reality
some of which are are basically
completely fraudulent and founded on
nothing. And you know, historians are I
I guess it&#39;s also a bit of a problem
that as academic historians have
slightly vacated the field, right? They
don&#39;t they&#39;re not quite as public facing
as they could be. They&#39;re not talking to
the the public often. They&#39;re talking to
each other. That allows opportunists and
charlatans and whatnot to to enter the
conversation, dominate the conversation
instead. And once you&#39;ve left that arena
and if you&#39;re not very good at speaking
to the public, then it becomes very hard
to fight back against it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don, I I want to talk to you about the
evil because a lot of people use that
word particularly to talk about events
in history, whether it&#39;s the British
Empire, whether it&#39;s you Adolf Hitler
and Adolf Hitler. When we think about
evil, we think about Adolf Hitler.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and you look at these people and you
go in Hitler&#39;s mind, obviously what he
did was horrendous. and evil. But in his
own mind, he thought he was doing good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And if you look at a lot of these
figures from history,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they believe that they were doing some
type of good. Whether it&#39;s the
concistadors,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whether it&#39;s, you know, the Mayans who
are praying to the god. Why wouldn&#39;t you
rip the heart out of a child? You have
to appease a god otherwise we all die.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How do we reconcile that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isn&#39;t it? Even Bridgetson thinks she&#39;s
doing good. Um, I think uh, how do you
reconcile it? Do you need to reconcile
it? Do you need to I in a in a sense
human beings never think they&#39;re the bad
guys? You know, that scene, the famous
scene from the Michelin Web sketch where
they they&#39;re looking at their their Nazi
soldiers and they&#39;re kind of looking at
their badges and saying, &#34;Are we
actually are we?&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Are we the baddies? The skulls?
Like, really?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Have you looked at our caps recently?
Our caps.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The badges on our caps. Have you looked
at them?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What? No. A bit.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;ve got skulls on them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Have you noticed that our caps have
actually got little pictures of skulls
on them?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t. Uh,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hands.
Are we the baddies?
There&#39;s never a moment I think where
people you know willfully
genuinely cast themselves as the
villains. So to take your example of the
Nazis, we did an episode of the rest is
history about Nazi ideology and about
why they thought they were,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, they were doing not God&#39;s
work, but they were doing science&#39;s
work. Actually, they thought life was
racial struggle and um they believed
that they were, you know, operating in
the cause of racial hygiene and that
they would leave Germany a better place
and the world a better place. Right?
That&#39;s what Nazi ideologists think. It&#39;s
what they tell their soldiers. their
soldiers, even as they&#39;re carrying out
all what would strike us as appalling
atrocities on the Eastern Front, they
sort of will write in their diaries and
their letters, they&#39;ll say, &#34;Well, it
look sounded, you know, might sound
grim, but it kind of had to be done and
it&#39;s better that we&#39;ve done it.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think there are it&#39;s very hard to find
people in history who say, &#34;I know this
is evil and I&#39;m actually a terrible
person, but does Stalin think he&#39;s a bad
man?&#34; I would say not. All that we know
about Stalin is that you see I don&#39;t
think Stalin is an inverted commas a
monster. I think Stalin is a Marxist
which is slightly different. I can&#39;t if
I can say that a monster and a Marxist
on this show are two different things.
So Stalin thinks he takes his Marxism
very seriously. I think um the recent
scholarship on Stalin has really
emphasized the extent to which he&#39;s a
true believer in his own ideology. He
thinks he&#39;s operating um again not
unlike the Nazis, following scientific
laws that will lead to human progress
and that the world will be a better
place and that collectivization
or purges, getting rid of enemies, all
of these kinds of things that ultimately
the world will be better afterwards and
he will have done tough work, you know,
dirty work, but it had to be done.
That&#39;s what a lot of people think in
history that this was, you know, more
interesting people. Of course, there are
always people who were just sort of
boringly greedy and venal and corrupt or
whatever. But somebody like Stalin, I
think, is interesting and chilling
precisely because he thinks he&#39;s he&#39;s on
the side of right. He&#39;s on the side of
morality. And it&#39;s the capitalists who
are the bad people. He&#39;s the good
person. Now, Hitler undoubtedly thought
of himself as a good person, as somebody
who would be rewarded by posterity for
having done what had to be done to make
Germany safer, cleaner, happier,
racially pure, all of those kinds of
things. It&#39;s very shocking for us to
think that people would think that they
were the they were the good guys, but
people in history always think they&#39;re
the good guys. They&#39;re always the heroes
of their own story.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s one of the reasons I always uh I&#39;ve
talked about this a lot. I don&#39;t fear
evil people that much. One of the
reasons they do exist in my opinion.
There are people who are just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bad people,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; evil, genuinely evil people who like
torturing other people or killing other
people for the sake of it. Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But it&#39;s very difficult if you&#39;re evil
to motivate millions of other people to
join you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. However, if you have a very
persuasive story about why certain evil
things need to be done for the greater
good, that&#39;s when you can persuade
yourself into ignoring rules,
conscience, whatever. And you can lead
millions of people behind you. Which is
why I I I am always very wary of people
who have this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh very strong sense of certainty about
the fact that they are leading us in the
right direction. And just this one time
we just need to ignore the rules of
normal behavior just to get to you know
we just suspend democracy for a bit we
just you kill these people or we just
those are the really dangerous people in
history aren&#39;t they
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the big killers the biggest killers were
utopian idealists right they were people
who believed in a better world Hitler
undoubtedly you know it sounds weird say
it but he&#39;s an idealist Stalin is
obviously an idealist ma is an idealist
Paul pot when the kouge come in in
Cambodia in the 1970s year zero empty
the cities start again on the
They think they are going to make a
better world. And you know, you can&#39;t
make an omelette without breaking some
eggs. That is the classic thing. That&#39;s
what the Jacob thought in the French
Revolution. Um, it&#39;s one, it&#39;s funny
because I was only, I was rereading The
Handmaid&#39;s Tale the other day, you know,
a Margaret Atwoods sort of uh um
feminist sort of science speculative
fiction book and which lots of people
watching this will have seen the TV
adaptation. And she gave an interview
about that when she said, you know, the
real enemy here, it&#39;s absolutely not an
anti-religious book. It&#39;s not an
anti-male book. The real enemy is is and
I quote utopian idealism because the
people who are the oppressors who run
the regime think they are doing the
right thing and that they will and I
think all great you know dystopias 1984
brave new world whatever the villains as
it were are people who think they&#39;re
good people and I completely agree with
you and this is probably because I&#39;m a
very reactionary person as well but the
enemy is certainty the enemy is people
who say I know what should be done I
know who what right where right and
wrong lie. I know I&#39;m a good person.
That goes back to the point I was making
earlier about, you know, losing the
sense of the tragic. And one of the
things that I think the sense of the
tragic um makes you aware of is your own
weakness and frailty and your and your
own you know that I think if we&#39;re
honest with ourselves we know that we
could be greedy and corrupt and violent
and sadistic that because we know from
history by the way that lots of
unexpected people have that in them the
kind of all those people who previously
had been a boring bank cler in Hanover
but actually suddenly for a few months
in 1941 or 1942 turn out to be the most
unbelievable sadistic killers and then
go back and be a boring bankark again
for the rest of their lives. You know
this says a lot about bankers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I think within all of us knowledge
of the beast I was just joking of course
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; knowledge of the beast is is so
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but let me push back on the idea. So you
talk about certainty and you know you
you having that knowledge that we&#39;re all
flawed and broken and I agree with you.
Yeah, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but look at Churchill. Churchill was
pretty certain. He was the one raising
the alarm in the 1930s, banging the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He had been he had made many mistakes,
but he had that certainty.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Cometh the hour cometh the man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But what Churchill believes in is
uh first of all, Churchill is very aware
of his own flaws and his own frailty
precisely because he&#39;s made so many
mistakes. So Churchill knows that he has
a terrible screw- up in him at any given
moment, you know, and he&#39;s his mad
schemes often they don&#39;t work. Churchill
I think has a it&#39;s one reason I&#39;m always
slightly baffled by the intense
antipathy to Churchill by sort of the
more sort of woke element is that I
think Churchill of all historical
characters has a very kind of generous
human sense of his own frailties the
qualities and frailties of others how
complicated life is you know you only
have to read his memoir my early life
when he&#39;s talking about you know serving
on the in the northwest frontier in
India he&#39;s talking by the men he served
with Indians as well as British. There&#39;s
a kind of he&#39;s there&#39;s a rhyess to it
and an awareness of kind of the
complexity of human life and human
nature. So sure is believe has things he
really believes in. He really believes
in the empire. He believes in Britain.
He believes that Britain stands for
freedom and that the Nazis are bad
people and that Hitler is a threat to
democracy and all of those kinds of
things. But I don&#39;t think that is
um I I don&#39;t think that flows from that
sort of intensely moralistic slightly
self-promoting certainty that we&#39;re
talking about which is the sense of I&#39;m
a good person. I&#39;m a really kind and you
know and generous person and I&#39;m on the
side of the angels and all of that kind
of thing. I think Churchill absolutely
did have the sense what I would call the
sense of the tragic. So, in other words,
Churchill believes that, you know, life
can be pretty brutal and because he&#39;s
seen war up front.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, he knows how tough it can be.
And I don&#39;t think he thinks he thinks
we&#39;re going to muddle through. You know,
his famous catchphrase is keep buggering
on KBO. You know, you keep just keep
going and you&#39;ll get there eventually.
But Churchill doesn&#39;t think you know I
will lead the world into a place where
everybody you know there&#39;ll be kind of
lambs gambling in the fields and
everybody will be singing come by and
all of that kind of thing. Churchill is
not an idealist in that sense. I think
his life he is devoted he&#39;s devoted his
life to kind of quite concrete things to
Britain to its empire to tr you know its
traditions its history all of that but
not to an abstract noun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s not trying to remake the world. And
I think one of the other things because
I I agree with Francis in the sense that
I think quite often the people who
really do make a difference in the world
are people who have very strong faith in
in in in things that they believe in
that they want to bring in the changes
they want to make etc. I think the issue
is quite often what you&#39;re willing to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, of course.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the service of that and if you&#39;re
willing to violate particular standards
and norms and rules about not hurting
other people, not killing other people,
not uh you know disenfranchising other
people in order to achieve your goals.
That&#39;s where I see the distinction,
right? Because if you firmly believe in
a particular worldview, well that&#39;s fine
as long as you&#39;re not willing to use
that to hurt other people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I think there&#39;s a couple of things I
think one of them is seeing other people
as expendable, other human beings lives
as expendable. I mean that&#39;s obviously
what I say Stalin would have done.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So Stalin&#39;s thinking is you know I will
make this better world. Unfortunately
these X million people will have to go
first but I mean you know that&#39;s a price
worth paying. I think once you&#39;re using
that sort of language, you know,
politicians always, by definition, a
political leader will have to make bad
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that will involve some people getting
hurt, right? Even if it&#39;s in a very
small way because they&#39;re going to lose
lose a benefit or they&#39;re going to pay
tax or such, right? You&#39;re always going
to make choices if you&#39;re a sensible
polit. I mean, obviously, if you&#39;re like
Kia Star or somebody, you don&#39;t like
making choices at all, but most polit
effective politicians know that there
always going to be losers. Yeah. There
always going to be people whose lives
are worse and you hope that there&#39;ll be
as few of those as possible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But once you&#39;re get getting into the
game of constantly saying, &#34;Well,
there&#39;s a price worth paying.&#34;
Unfortunately, those people had to die
or whatever. I think that&#39;s very
dangerous.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the dying part is where I&#39;m
aiming my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I and I think the the the coroller
to go back to your point about certainty
and I think there&#39;s a difference between
believing something strongly and being
suffocatingly certain about it. So in
other words, I would say I mean you
obviously believe something strongly,
right? You have strong views,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I would well I would assume or I
would hope that you&#39;re aware that not
everybody has those views and other
views are available, right? Of course,
of course we all are.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I think it&#39;s being aware of the
contingency of your position that if you
were somebody else, you might believe
something different. And that that&#39;s
kind of fine, right? I don&#39;t expect I
don&#39;t think I have a hotline to God or
to the truth and that therefore
everybody should fall into line with me
and they&#39;re just wrong and I&#39;m just
right. I think that&#39;s the issue, isn&#39;t
it? Someone like Stalin or Hitler, they
thought, well, I&#39;m just right. Because
in the both cases, actually, they were
kind of scientific materialists to some
degree. They thought the laws of nature
and the world, I know them, you know,
Karl Marx or whoever told me them and
I&#39;m just following those laws. So the
other the other opinions are by
definition illegitimate. They are
totally wrong and the people who are
promoting them are liars and basically I
need to get rid of them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whereas in an impuristic society you&#39;re
aware that there&#39;s lots of valid
viewpoints and let&#39;s say Churchill.
Churchill doesn&#39;t like bulism doesn&#39;t
like socialism but he&#39;s perfectly happy
to work with socialists in his war
cabinet. Clement gets on brilliantly
with them. And Churchill himself is
ideologically complicated. He&#39;s changed
parties. He was once very radical. He
ends up becoming much more conservative.
You know, he&#39;s conscious of the
complexity of a kind of pluralistic
worldview. And that&#39;s what makes him
ultimately, I think, a very attractive
figure because I think what he&#39;s
representing there is a kind of breadth
that these monsters don&#39;t have. They&#39;re
narrow. That&#39;s they&#39;re claust there&#39;s
something claustrophobic I think about
their worldview because they exclude
everything outside of it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right people, it&#39;s trivia time.
Financial trivia to be exact. Do you
know what retirement asset grew the most
in the first 6 months of President
Trump&#39;s second term? Many of you
probably guessed the stock market was
the best since what&#39;s backing the most
retirement accounts in American today is
that. But from January the 21st through
July 21st, the Dow Jones grew less than
1%. What about Bitcoin? President Trump
loves Bitcoin, so it must have performed
well, right? Well, it did. It grew
nearly 15%, an impressive six-month
investment, but it&#39;s not the number one.
The heavyweight champion was, wait for
it, gold and silver. Gold and silver are
considered to be safe haven investments.
So, many of you will be surprised to
learn they both grew by a whopping 25%
in President Trump&#39;s first 6 months. 25%
in 6 months. Not bad for safe haven
investments. Our partners, Augusta

This episode is brought to you by Massa
Chips. Here&#39;s something you might not
know. All chips and fries used to be
cooked in beef tallow. That is until the
1990s when big food companies swapped it
out for cheap ultrarocessed seed oils.
Now seed oils make up about 20% of the
average American calories and they&#39;ve
been linked to inflammation, metabolic
problems, and energy crashes. Massive
chips decided to go back to the good
stuff. Their tortilla chips are made
from just three ingredients. Organic
nyximalized corn, sea salt, and 100%
grass-fed beef tallow. That&#39;s it. No
seed oils, no nonsense. They don&#39;t just
leave out the bad stuff. They taste
incredible. Crunchier than the usual
junk, strong enough to scoop without
snapping, and you don&#39;t feel bloated or
sluggish after eating them. In fact,
thanks to the tallow, they&#39;re actually
satisfying. You eat a handful, feel
good, and move on. Mass&#39;s got a serious

And when we think about Hitler, we think
about the most evil man that has ever
lived. And I think look, obviously he
he&#39;s not true. No,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sorry. No, I was I was checking myself.
I was saying I was going to say I I
don&#39;t know whether he is, but the fact
that it&#39;s in my head is a partly a
result of education.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And we think about him as the most
evil man that ever lived. Even though he
Stalin killed more people, Ma killed
more people. And yet you talk to the
average person and if someone says
they&#39;re a communist, we just go,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#34;Okay, he&#39;s communist.&#34; When someone
says they&#39;re a Nazi.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. How many conversations with
Nazis are you having?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Quite a lot, mate. With our
foundation. No, but genuinely, do you
know what I mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I do know what you mean. I think
it&#39;s a really funny thing. You know, I
often tell this story. I was backpacking
in uh Bulgaria uh with some student
friends in the 1990s and um we were in
this village and there was a bloke
there. He was like selling old communist
memorabilia
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and we were looking through it cuz you
know we&#39;re interested in history. We
were kind looking through, oh, look,
there&#39;s a medal of style and there&#39;s all
this kind of thing. And this bloke said,
I have other tray. And he kind of pulled
out this other tray underneath the this
is like the real tray. And the real tray
is was full of like SS stuff. And I
mean, like, oh no, put it away. Put it
away. Terrible. I&#39;m not interested in
that. But afterwards, we were talking
about it, how our reactions were
different, right? The communist stuff
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to a Brit in the 1990s was kind of
slightly comical, right? You could have
a hammer and sickle t-shirt as a student
and people would kind of, you know, or
CCCP or whatever and no one&#39;s going to
think anything of it really. You know,
it&#39;s a bit of an affectation. You&#39;re
sort of showing off a little bit,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but it&#39;s um it&#39;s an aesthetic thing as
much as anything. Obviously, you know, a
swastika t-shirt walking into a student
union with a swastika t-shirt is is
pretty punchy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and you&#39;re going to get a very different
kind of reaction. And I think obviously
to some degree that reflects the fact
that for us in Britain, Nazism was the
real enemy. We&#39;re very conscious of the
death toll. Um it seems nihilistic and
horrendous and utterly beyond the pale,
right? If somebody wears a swastika
t-shirt, you I think you pretty much
say, &#34;Okay, that&#39;s it.&#34; You know, we we
have it&#39;s inconceivable to me that one
of my friends could come over with a
swastika t-shirt
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unless they&#39;re Hindu,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Well, I guess that&#39;s you&#39;re
you&#39;re trying quite hard there or a
famous rapper, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you&#39;re wearing that you&#39;re wearing that
hammer and sickle t-shirt in Poland or
in you know the former occupied Eastern
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or you&#39;re walking around
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with a Cam Rouge t-shirt in Cambodia or
something. I mean
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that that&#39;s obviously going to have a
very very different um so it does
slightly depend where you&#39;re standing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that because of there&#39;s also a
perception of intentionality? There is
there&#39;s the sense I think most people
fundamentally don&#39;t understand the thing
we&#39;ve been talking about in this
conversation which is the Nazis were
also well-intentioned
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they think the Nazis were just evil
whereas the communists were
well-intentioned I think you&#39;re right
and the things that they did were kind
of like well they were trying to make
they were trying to do good but then
they just put these people in camps or
they killed and also I think the other
thing as well the difference is
communists killed millions of people Mao
and Stalin a lot of the deaths were
actually through incompetence and the
inability of the economic model that
they were applying to actually feed
people basically.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Right. So that they do kill people
deliberately. Of course they do.
Starting purges, the great terror um you
know um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but that doesn&#39;t compare to marching 7
million people if you include all the
different groups into
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; into Yeah. Exactly. Do you know what I
mean? Exactly. There&#39;s not the sort of
there&#39;s not quite the same
industrialized deliberate Yeah. uh
methodical apparatus of extermination.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the really controversial thing I
wanted to ask you is when France has
said Hitler is the most evil man blah
blah blah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is he the most evil man?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From from my reading of World War II,
like I know this will be controversial.
I&#39;m not sure what the Japanese did in
World War II wasn&#39;t worse than what the
Germans did.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh I think the death toll of the the
Japanese don&#39;t have an exterminator
program in the same way that the the
Germans do. The Japanese So if you if
you imagine you had a Japanese guest,
right? what a sort of nationalistic
Japanese guest
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that guest would say to you, I can&#39;t
believe I&#39;ve I&#39;ve degenerated to
impersonating a Japanese.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I hope you don&#39;t do the accent because
that really would take us out of life.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um I he would presumably say, &#34;Look,
we&#39;re doing what European
colonializers.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. What you I&#39;ll do it again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We&#39;re butchering millions of people with
shovels and bayonets. And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he would say, &#34;Violence happens people.&#34;
But he&#39;d say, &#34;Did not Dominic say
earlier in the show that violence
happens and bad things happen in all
empires and so on and so forth? Why are
you judging us by different standards?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he would probably say that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But wouldn&#39;t Adolf Hitler say that too?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, because I think Hitler um I mean
Hitler might, but Hitler has an
exterminatory program which very few
other empires do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s fair.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So to give you an example that you
mentioned, which is the Spanish in the
in the Americas,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the Spanish a lot of people die when the
Spanish arrive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Loads of people die and they die through
disease. They desire through mass, they
die through massacres, all of those
kinds of things. But the Spanish really
don&#39;t want to kill a lot of people. What
they really want is workers. And they&#39;re
gutted when all these people start dying
in the Caribbean or whatever. So the
so-called genocide that the Spanish
carry out in the Caribbean, the Tyino
people, when they arrive, there are none
of them left, right, within a couple of
decades. And the Spanish were really
disappointed because they&#39;d wanted these
people to be working the gold mines and
whatnot for them. They don&#39;t want to go
to the Americas and kill loads of
people. It&#39;s not part of their program.
They want to make loads of money and if
they have to kill a few people, fair
enough. That&#39;s as they see it. That&#39;s
part of the game. But they don&#39;t have a
genocidal program.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Third Reich is unusual.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I see.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In having a deliberate genocidal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even the Mongols weren&#39;t really
genocidal. They were like, &#34;Either
surrender, we&#39;ll kill you. But if you
surrender, we&#39;ll exactly sucking your
city is just part of the course, right?&#34;
That&#39;s what they think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that&#39;s what makes the Nazis kind of
different is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think it makes them Yeah. It makes
them really chilling and unsettling. And
there is a sort of um this application
of the apparatus of of industrial
modernity to killing people. I think
that&#39;s what a lot of people it&#39;s like
you know you think about some of one of
the most you know some of the most
chilling films about the Holocaust.
There&#39;s the film Conspiracy which is
about the Vanay conference and it&#39;s
literally just people sitting around a
table like this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; talking about you know how they&#39;re going
to organize the infrastructure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. or the film I can&#39;t remember the
title now where you never see that you
never see it but you hear it where it&#39;s
set just over there it&#39;s the uh camp
commandant at Achvitz very recent film
did really well um and you you again you
don&#39;t see what&#39;s happening in the camp
but you see the benality
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the ordered methodical
um almost sort of humdrum nature of the
of the apparatus of killing I think
that&#39;s what we find really terrifying
about the Nazis and that&#39;s different I
think from let&#39;s
Stalin&#39;s great terror,
his I mean it&#39;s not unlike other terrors
in history. There&#39;s a sort of um an ad
hoc nature to it of you know there&#39;s a
it&#39;s a regime trying to purge people
within it. We&#39;ve seen it many times in
history. It&#39;s on a much bigger scale of
course but it doesn&#39;t have that kind of
quite had that cold.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s kind of like the French Revolution
and what happened after it cuz basically
you&#39;ve got a bunch of these like crazy
lunatic revolutionaries and you can&#39;t
really run a country like that. So you
have to kill them off and then you kill
off the people who killed them off and
until you you you really
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the idea of the enemy within.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the idea of the enemy within um
is a very the traitor within
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is a is a really dangerous one once you
go down that road. So it almost always
happens with revolutionary regimes.
They&#39;re in battle from the very
beginning because they&#39;ve got the the
old regime. They&#39;re worried they&#39;re
going to come back or they&#39;ve got
foreign advers. they&#39;ve got foreign
adversaries adversaries as they did in
the French Revolution. That&#39;s why I&#39;m
getting so excited talking about the
French Revolution that I can&#39;t even
speak. Um, and then when you start
looking at your kind of you look in
internally and you look at domestic
opposition, you say, &#34;Well, these people
are not just, you know, critics or
opponents, they&#39;re traitors and they&#39;re
a threat to our revolution. Then they&#39;ve
got to go.&#34; And you see that again and
again. And what&#39;s really interesting and
worrying at the same time is you look at
our economy which is faltering to put it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People are getting poorer. People aren&#39;t
going to be able to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m intrigued about where you&#39;re going
to go with it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is it are you going to ask the key
question which is basically is K starin?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Exact. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s that
competent if I&#39;m going to be honest with
you or has the courage of his
convictions either. But I guess my point
is, do you get concerned when you see us
enter these kind of economic times where
richer and rich and poor, the gap is
getting ever wider, people are
struggling economically,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that we&#39;re going to enter more turbulent
times and these are the times where
utopianism, yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; socialism, you know, these people are
bad. That&#39;s going to start to creep in
as people look quite naturally for
someone to play. Uh, am I concerned
about it? I think it will happen, but
I&#39;m not concerned about it because I
think that&#39;s history, right? That&#39;s just
what happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s a really reason not to be
concerned about it. I mean, no offense.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I think my entire family is going
to get wiped out, but that&#39;s history,
mate. You know, don&#39;t worry about it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is what I think. That is what I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean that&#39;s what you think?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that&#39;s what I I think that&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you have children, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what if they all get killed? Are you
not concerned about this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I will say to my son, you know,
the lesson of history is your neighbors
will probably try to kill and eat you.
So, make sure you kill them first.
He is rightwing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think but I think I think that&#39;s like
complaining. Are you not concerned that
very soon you know the summer will be
over and winter will come? I&#39;m like of
course I&#39;m not concerned about it. I
mean I know it&#39;s going to happen. It&#39;d
be waste of time to lie awake worrying
about it. I think people who like us,
you know, born in the post-war period,
grew up in the years of affluence,
um, sort of came of age in the postcold
war era, end of history, you know,
liberal democracy,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh, I we still, even though we
intellectually maybe think, oh yeah, I
know that&#39;s not the norm, and I know
history is much darker, but I think
still instinctively we kind of think
it&#39;d be nice if it like that all the
time. You know, be nice if it was just
economic growth and everybody was happy
and we were all friends. It would be
nice, but it&#39;s never going to happen.
The 21st century will see loads of wars
and uh disasters. Uh there&#39;ll be a lot
of, you know, am I worried about people
being scapegoated or whatever. I mean, I
guess it&#39;s sad that it happens. It is
sad that it happens for the avoidance of
having it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um it is sad that it happens, but it&#39;s
going to happen. Like, history&#39;s not
going to stop. There will be people who
are tremendous villains who will come to
power and there will be um you know
massacres and stuff and because human
nature is never going to change. People
will always keep behaving badly
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and stuff will keep happening and
there&#39;ll be migrant crises and there
will be coups and there will be a
revolution somewhere and all of those
things will happen. Am I concerned about
it? Not really because I spent all my
life reading about it about happening in
the past and I know that history is not
suddenly going to stop. You know, I&#39;m
not Tony Blair or Bill Clinton thinking
that brilliant, the world is perfect.
We&#39;re in 1999 and let&#39;s hope that you
know nothing ever happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The world was pretty good in 1999
though. Don&#39;t you don&#39;t you think?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It really was. It was a great time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was a great time. I guess it kind of
was, but I mean maybe we obviously we
think that for very contingent reasons.
You know, there were lots of places
where it wasn&#39;t.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we don&#39;t care about them. I&#39;m
talking about for us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it was great for us. We I think
this is precisely the problem, right?
This is the the problem about um us
having a slightly stareyed view of
humanity and how history works and what
the future will bring. You know, that
sort of sense that people have now where
they sort of, you know, talk about, oh,
Britain&#39;s in such a mess. Uh the Western
world tearing itself apart. We live in
nature of populism and polarization.
Isn&#39;t that a terrible shame? And blah
blah blah blah. And I often like, you
know what, when we talk about how
terrible everything is,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; most people in history would say, well,
a, those things are completely normal. I
mean, that&#39;s just life. And b, you&#39;ve
got all those things that we always had,
but also you&#39;re living until you&#39;re 80
and you have central heating and you get
to go on holiday all the time and you,
you know, all this kind of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and your children survive into
adulthood.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are you winging about? Yeah, you&#39;ve
got all the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think what people are winging about
and I don&#39;t blame them is that things
are moving in a downward direction,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s what people are winging about
because uh objectively speaking, I
completely agree with you. Life&#39;s great.
If you and I the my pinned thing on my
Twitter is the West is brilliant.
There&#39;s a clip of me talking about why
we&#39;re all lucky and we are lucky to live
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I&#39;d quite like my children and
grandchildren to also feel lucky to live
where we live. And that&#39;s what people
are concerned about.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I understand why they&#39;re concerned about
that, but
But your point is that there&#39;s nothing
you can do about it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t necessarily think that there&#39;ll
be lots of winners. There always are.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, the nature of being a parent
is you want your children to be among
the winners and not the losers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Indeed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But ultimately, the nature of al being a
parent is also realizing that you can&#39;t
control your child&#39;s destiny. So, to
some degree, you do your best, but
there&#39;s no much point worrying about it.
I just always think, you know, a thing
that always um plays on my mind, I think
about this a lot, is what it would have
been like to have been a German in 1910.
You live in a newly unified country
where life really has got a lot better
in the last few decades. You live in one
of the most sophisticated,
civilized,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the German people were amazing. This is
the thing that we all lose because of of
everything that happened after 1910.
Quite rightly, they were an amazing
people. so advanced in so many different
like reading about the they were like
they were act you kind of read it you go
Hitler kind of had a bit of a point this
was like a superior race to some extent
in terms of all the development
scientific I&#39;m joking obviously but you
know what I mean they were incredible
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right of course and so that&#39;s 1910 if
someone says to you then well how do you
think the future will play out you well
it probably be like this yeah it&#39;s going
to be great like we&#39;re and and actually
you know what you could not conceive of
how terrible it&#39;s going to be.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So looking forward, do I do I worry
looking forward to the future? I just
think it&#39;s unknowable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And there are societies right now that
seem sophisticated, safe, united that
may well, you know, you 2050 you&#39;ll be
talking about it and saying, &#34;My god,
who knew that Belgium would have a civil
war that would last 20 years or
whatever.&#34; I mean, silly example, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you just simply cannot predict um what
will happen. And do I worry about it? I
don&#39;t really worry because I just think
that really is a waste of time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s a really interesting way of
looking at it. The maybe as we wrap up
the one thing I it&#39;s probably worth
asking as well is you&#39;ve you&#39;ve
delivered a masterclass of presenting
the tragic vision. Thomas Soul talks
about this kind of being core of the the
more right of center the more
conservative worldview really uh which
is human nature is what it is.
Technology changes therefore we express
human nature in different ways.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Exactly. Um, oh, before we get to
that, actually something else I was
going to ask you which ties into this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do you think that nuclear weapons
fundamentally changed the course of
human history? Because this peace
dividend that we&#39;ve had is actually
because of nuclear weapons.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I do. I do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that is that why
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do I think um there would have been a
third world war without nuclear weapons.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That makes sense to me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s no question in my mind. I think
there would have been a war. Maybe not
immediately.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, we&#39;d be in one now, right? I mean,
Russia, Ukraine probably would have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it could be. Could be. I think
there would definitely have been a war
um probably over Berlin in maybe it
would have been delayed until 196061
or something like that. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but it would have come then human
missile crisis obviously what holds them
back is the fear of nuclear annihilation
again in the early 1980s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know you could have multiple world
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh during the cold war and every time
they&#39;re held back by nuclear weapons.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s so fascinating. It&#39;s almost like
human nature in that way where like the
worst thing is also the best thing
because nuclear weapons probably will
lead to the annihilation of all humanity
at some point. It&#39;s very possible in my
opinion, but also it&#39;s why we&#39;ve had
we&#39;ve avoided a global war. Yeah, agree.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s so weird. But anyway, coming back
to this this tragic vision which you
presented, I feel like the way we talk
about modern things that are going on,
conflict in Russia and Ukraine, in
Israel and Gaza,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is partly because we we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve
lost the that right. Do do you get where
I&#39;m going with this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do. Yeah, I do. We we Sorry, I I was
distracted by the fact that I was
resting my foot on your foot and I
thought it and actually
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; quite a lot happens under the table.
You don&#39;t get that on every podcast, do
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You go to Rogan, you&#39;re not going to get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. People always go, &#34;Why haven&#39;t you
got enough female guests?&#34; It&#39;s cuz of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Listen, I can&#39;t help.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Women aren&#39;t into that sort of Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It doesn&#39;t often happen on on podcasts
where the the host is playing footsie
with you under the table. But yeah, you
learn something special.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, so in the sense that we&#39;re talking
about those wars and we&#39;re surprised by
them. We&#39;re surprised what happened and
we&#39;re very moralistic in the way we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the way we talk about them, you
know, genocide like everything&#39;s a
genocide now. Do you know what I mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do. I do know what you mean that
there&#39;s um uh the language of we&#39;re
we&#39;re sort of we&#39;re horrified, we&#39;re
surprised, we reach for extreme language
to describe what we&#39;re seeing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And I think maybe the war in
Ukraine is a really good example of this
because Putin, if he was here now, would
say, and he said it himself, you know,
I&#39;m doing what Peter the Great did. I&#39;m
doing what Katherine the Great did. I
want to make Russia strong
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and that&#39;s my job
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I really would like an outlet on the
Black Sea. You know, I&#39;d like Crimea and
actually I&#39;d really like Ukraine to be a
puppet state and that&#39;s what empires do.
We want puppet to be bring back puppet
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and this is our sphere of influence and
we&#39;ll do whatever the hell we want.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We&#39;ll do what we want because that&#39;s
what big powers do. That&#39;s exactly what
he would say. And he would say, &#34;Look at
you having a hissy fit about it.&#34; Now, I
think Putin&#39;s a terrible man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very committed to the defense of
Ukraine. But I think
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pretending that Putin is something
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is a weird way of thinking about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like I&#39;ve been very very pro Ukraine,
but on the basis of exactly what you&#39;re
saying, which is of course he&#39;s going to
do that. That&#39;s why he can&#39;t be allowed
to do it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Exactly. You know what I mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s the most obvious thing in the
world. Like he wants to conquer that
country and it&#39;s not in our interest to
let him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. That&#39;s exactly my I I wrote this
column actually before the war happened
just as he was gearing up and there were
people saying oh he&#39;s not going to do it
he&#39;s not going to do it or is he going
to do it and I said I I wrote a column
saying I think he is going to do it
because thinking about Putin the way he
sees the world why wouldn&#39;t you do it he
thinks the west is really divided and
weak it was about the point when like
you know I gave the example at the time
there was a massive halaloo about Boris
Johnson having a cake or something to do
with co and I was like he looks at the
west right now Joe Biden is 3,000 years
oldor Boris Johnson is battling with a
cake or whatever, why wouldn&#39;t you? If
you&#39;re him and you have that ruthless,
coldblooded, amoral view of human
relations and all you care about is
basically oldfashioned Russian
imperialism,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; why wouldn&#39;t you do it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Totally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that&#39;s and so I think so when people
are is Putin mad, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s not mad. He would say, I&#39;m doing
exactly what empire builders have done
all through history. Now, I don&#39;t want
his empire to succeed. I don&#39;t like it.
So, I think we should stop him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right? But I don&#39;t delude myself about
what the nature of.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s why I never used all this
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] language about like it&#39;s an
illegal war. What what do you mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I agree with you about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What does that even mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that I think I agree with you
completely. And I think most people who
I I don&#39;t want to completely go down the
road of saying might is right, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; most wars that have ever been fought
were inverted commas illegal wars,
right? A hundred years war, a legal war.
I mean maybe Edward III would have said
it was because of his claim to the
throne of France but come on
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know this is the point about the the
conservative view of human nature I
suppose right that people will try to do
what they can to maximize their own
power and their own stability and
security and we shouldn&#39;t be surprised
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when somebody who is not our friend
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tries to do that you know when tries to
benefit his own country at the expense
of others Putin would say you&#39;ve
misunderstood the game you don&#39;t
understand the rules I&#39;m playing the
game properly And you clowns in the
west, you know, preining yourselves
about your principles have misunderstood
what we&#39;re all doing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it&#39;s also as well like you use the
word amoral. I imagine Putin would push
back on that and go, I&#39;m not amoral. I
am doing something very moral which is
the best for my country.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, he would. And that&#39;s a fair point
that I think one thing that&#39;s I think
really interesting that we have lost is
a sense of national interest. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there&#39;s a famous um interview of the
story often told somebody sitting next
to the then um cabinet secretary I think
it was Sagus O&#39;Donnell and they asked
him what&#39;s more important in your view
for you to do as the British cabinet
secretary is it the Britain&#39;s interest
or the world&#39;s interest and he said I&#39;d
like to think it&#39;s the world&#39;s interests
I&#39;m like well I think it should be
Britain&#39;s interests I think again you&#39;re
misunderstanding the nature of the game
you&#39;re playing because let me tell you
the Chinese aren&#39;t thinking oh I&#39;ll do
what&#39;s in Britain&#39;s interests. If you&#39;re
not thinking it, nobody else is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I think we have partly as a result
of um the understandable revulsion of
the excesses of nationalism in the first
half of the 20th century, partly because
we&#39;ve built this kind of liberal
rules-based international order and so
on that so many people are very
committed to. we have actually lost
sense of the fact that there is a
competitive element to world affairs in
which basically you know you do what you
can for your team
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and that that means another team will
lose out
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and and that&#39;s again that&#39;s the nature
of a game.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dominic, it&#39;s been great having you on.
We&#39;re going to head over to Substack
where our audience get to ask you their
questions. Uh but before we do the last
question we always ask is what&#39;s the one
thing we&#39;re not talking about that we
really should be?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So it&#39;s something that you&#39;ve actually
alluded to already. I was gutted when
you brought it up because I was freeing
and priding myself on having thought of
this. Um, it&#39;s actually nuclear
annihilation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting how
much, you know, for me growing up in the
early 1980s, this was a constant threat.
You know, it was on TV, there were
dramas about it, there were people
protesting about nuclear weapons, you
know, was Ronald Reagan going to press
the button, all of this kind of thing.
And now of course we live in an age
where we don&#39;t really talk about it very
much at all as an omnipresent fear it
has vanished yet there are more
countries for nuclear capability and to
go back to the whole argument about
human nature nuclear weapons I do think
probably have saved lives since the
second world war and prevented wars but
human nature being as it is one day
people will use them
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and they&#39;ll use them I think out of fear
because I think that&#39;s how wars start
they will use them because they&#39;re not
because they are mad or because they&#39;re
evil, but because they&#39;re frightened and
they feel they have no alternative. And
especially in a world where AI will be
running a lot of these defense programs.
I think once that process starts, it
will be very difficult to stop. And it&#39;s
a bit like, you know, if you&#39;re a sort
of existentialist philosopher or
something, you you think to yourself,
how can people walk around knowing that
they&#39;re all going to die? Like why are
they bothering buying a sandwich from
pret and making plans for Sunday when
actually their own inevitable extinction
is coming. The reason is of course your
inevitable extinction is too big a thing
to think about and it would paralyze
you. And I sometimes wonder, you know,
will our descendants living in their
kind of irradiated ruins say how could
they walk around saying how brilliant
life is, you know, knowing that they&#39;re
sitting on all this stuff that one day
probably it will go off and it&#39;ll kill
everybody and destroy civilization. And
the answer is, I guess, that um
we&#39;re we&#39;re mugs. You know, we&#39;re we&#39;re
blind. We&#39;re willfully blind to the
potential this stuff has. And also
there&#39;s no one inventing it, right?
Never going to go away. We&#39;re just stuck
with it now. So, um, so yeah, that&#39;s a
cheery thought. You really are an
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we&#39;re all going to die in a
nuclear holocaust.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But you seem to believe that there will
be surviv people who live after that,
which which makes you an optimist.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mutant mutant, half crab, half human
scuttling in the ruins.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And on that note,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on that happy note, uh, head on over to
Substack where Dominic&#39;s going to answer
your questions.
Are there any key m moments in history
of whatif scenarios that you believe
could have dramatically altered the
outcome of a particular battle and in
turn change the course of a war?
