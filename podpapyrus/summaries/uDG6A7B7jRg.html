<li>Amanda Knox was wrongly convicted of murder and spent 4 years in prison in Italy for a crime she didn't commit - a case that became an international scandal</li>
<li>She developed a unique approach to healing by reaching out to and forming a relationship with the prosecutor who put her in prison</li>
<li>Her four-step methodology for difficult conversations: find common ground, give radical benefit of the doubt, acknowledge humanity while setting boundaries, and maintain both accountability and compassion</li>
<li>She emphasized the importance of accepting reality as it is rather than dwelling on the life you should have lived - this acceptance leads to becoming a more effective agent in your own life</li>
<li>Knox advocates for criminal justice reform, particularly recording all police interrogations and protecting witnesses' rights, not just suspects</li>
<li>She discovered that approaching her prosecutor with kindness and curiosity made her feel more powerful than she'd ever felt - like a "superhero" - demonstrating the transformative power of compassion</li>
<li>The conversation explores how institutions (media, legal system, politics) can be corrupted by incentive structures that prioritize winning over truth-seeking</li>
<li>Knox discusses the ongoing legal battle in Italy where she's still convicted of slander, showing how the system refuses to admit its mistakes</li>
<li>She addresses criticism about telling her story, defending her right as a victim to share her experiences despite others claiming she's not the "real" victim</li>
<li>The discussion covers the dangers of social media algorithms and how they prime people to be psychopaths, encouraging disconnected cruelty</li>
<li>Knox practices meditation and finds unexpected benefits, including increased libido, showing how slowing down can help rediscover suppressed parts of yourself</li>
<li>She's pursuing stand-up comedy as another form of self-expression, refusing to be limited by others' expectations of how a "tragic figure" should behave</li>
<li>The conversation emphasizes the importance of voluntary adversity and physical training as forms of moving meditation that build mental resilience</li>
<li>Knox struggles with trusting joy over pain, finding pain more familiar and trustworthy after her traumatic experiences</li>
<li>She advocates for treating all people like toddlers who need basic human needs met - attention, rest, and understanding - rather than judgment</li>
<li>The discussion highlights how hurt people hurt people, and how responding with curiosity rather than defensiveness can break cycles of harm</li>
<li>Knox emphasizes living as if there's a documentary crew filming your life - maintaining integrity even when no one is watching</li>
<li>She demonstrates that radical acceptance and forgiveness don't mean tolerating injustice or avoiding boundaries, but rather choosing not to be broken by traumatic experiences</li>

Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe
Rogan Experience. Train by day. Joe
Rogan podcast by night. All day.
Hello. Hey. Good to see you. Good to see
you again. You have a book. I do. Yeah.
I hope you like it. Free. That&#39;s a great
name. Yeah. Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s on point.
Yeah. It&#39;s on the nose. Yes. Well, that
that whole question of what does it mean
to be free and what you know, yes,
there&#39;s the physical like, oh, you&#39;re
out of prison, but then also is your
life the thing that you expected it to
be and how do you make your own freedom
when you feel hemmed in by all of the
things that happened to you? So, yeah,
you&#39;re connected to that forever. That&#39;s
always going to be a part of your life.
It&#39;s not like anything else that didn&#39;t
really happen. Like you didn&#39;t do
anything and you&#39;re connected to
something that you didn&#39;t really do
forever. For people that don&#39;t know the
story. Yeah. Yeah. We should do a little
recap. Recap. Okay. Recap friends. Real
quick. Recap friends. Um and you can go
back to the episode that of Joe Rogan.
What number was that? Do you not off the
top of your head? If you just Google
Amanda Knox, you&#39;ll go, &#34;Holy shit.&#34;
She&#39;ll go down a crazy rabbit hole. Yes.
So in a nutshell, what happened? Yeah. I
was studying abroad when I was 20 years
old in Peruia, Italy. My one of my
roommates was raped and murdered by a
burglar who broke into our home. But I
was accused of having orchestrated a
murder orgy. And I was sent to prison
for 4 years. I was sentenced to 26
years. I was put on trial for eight
years. And it became this international
scandal. uh where it sort of pinged all
of the buttons in all the right places.
This happened in
2007. So, you know, early 2000s when the
internet was well or the internet, the
social media was really becoming a
thing. The iPhone was becoming a thing.
I think that that played a huge role of
people sort of going into their little
echo chambers and fighting online. And
so I think that there was yeah it it was
a case that for whatever
reason rose above the the level of other
cases like ultimately this case was
actually very simple and it wouldn&#39;t
have risen to the level of international
infamy were it not for the series of
mistakes that the prosecution and the
def and the detectives made at the very
beginning by trying to pin a man&#39;s crime
on me, a woman.
Yeah. Um, and if anybody wants there&#39;s a
documentary. Yes, there&#39;s a Netflix
documentary. Um, I wrote a book called
Waiting to be Heard. And then more
recently, I wrote this book, Free My
Search for Meaning, which covers like,
you know, you can read it and learn
about the case, but it&#39;s mostly about
how do you come out of an experience
like that and make sense of it. And then
part one of the big stories in it is how
I then developed a relationship with my
prosecutor, which I think you&#39;ll
probably be in the camp of people of
thinking that I&#39;m utterly insane for
having done that. Maybe, maybe, maybe
you won&#39;t. I just remember that when we
talked about this back in the day, you
were like, &#34;This motherfucker.&#34; Yeah.
So, you&#39;ve become friends with him.
Friend is an interesting word. Um, what
is a friend? Someone else asked me that
like I was like depends on how what you
mean by friend. Um because and they said
well do you trust him? And I said well I
I think that at the point that we are
now in our relationship um I do trust
him. I trust that he&#39;s telling me the
truth about what he really thinks and
and feels about the situation. And so I
feel like I have very privileged special
to the mind of the person who put me in
prison. And that is a very interesting
uh awkward but also empowering place for
me to be because one of the things that
really bothered me about this experience
was not understanding why it happened to
me. Why did this man look at a
20-year-old girl with no criminal
history, no motivation to commit this
crime? Why did he look at me and think,
&#34;There&#39;s my rapist and murderer.&#34; And I
didn&#39;t understand it. And I didn&#39;t feel
like demonizing him in my mind or
vilifying him in my mind was going to
actually give me a satisfying answer as
to the why of it all. A lot of people
said, &#34;Well, it&#39;s just cuz he&#39;s a bad
dude. He doesn&#39;t care what the truth is.
He&#39;s just covering his ass.&#34; like these
were all really simplistic ways of
framing his motivations and I didn&#39;t
really buy them. Um so instead what I
was interested in was going to the
source and confronting him asking why.
But to ask someone, why did you hurt me?
Which I think is a really common thing
that people who have been hurt want to
know is they want an acknowledgement
that they&#39;ve been hurt and they want to
understand why and they they want to
know if that person&#39;s not going to hurt
them anymore or not going to hurt other
people. Like that&#39;s really common for
people who have been hurt. Um the
challenge is that people who hurt other
people don&#39;t like to be confronted with
that fact. And so, how do you start a
conversation that&#39;s not going to
immediately become adversarial? And that
was one of my biggest challenges. But I
came up with this
methodology that I actually became so
important to me that I tattooed it on my
arm. So, this is it. Um, there are four
steps. And, uh, the first one is find
common ground. So, it&#39;s this ven
diagram. Find common ground. I promise
you that every single person on this
earth, you have something in common with
them. Find it. So, I asked myself, what
could I and my prosecutor have in
common? I didn&#39;t know this man. I didn&#39;t
know what his history was, what his
background was, but I did know that he,
like me, was part of this really big
scandalous in the media case. And he
very likely felt misconstrued or
misrepresented. also in the process,
maybe dehumanized in the process. And so
I reached out to him and I acknowledged
that fact. I said, &#34;Hey, I don&#39;t know
who you are. I only ever encountered you
in the police office and in the
courtroom where you were someone who was
trying to ruin my life.&#34; So you were a
big scary
boogeyman. And I saw you in the media
and I, you know, I&#39;ve seen how the media
represented you. But I knowing from
experience, I know how that can be very
misrepresentative. So I said to him, I
want to know who you really are and I
hope that you might be interested to
know who I really am cuz I don&#39;t think
you know who I really am. I don&#39;t think
that you would have prosecuted me if you
knew who I really am. And that was the
beginning of the dialogue. this like I
went out of my way to acknowledge that
he might have had noble motivations even
if he was wrong. And I think this is
like a really important
is I I wanted to give
him radical benefit of the doubt.
Maybe, just maybe, this like horrible
thing that happened to me could have
been the result of understandable
mistakes. And if anything, I think
coming into contact with the innocence
movement and criminal justice system
stuff and reform, all the stuff that
I&#39;ve learned after having gone through
this experience has made me realize that
like some of the most horrible things
can happen and can be enacted by people
who have the best of intentions. And so
I assumed that of him and I gave him
that benefit of the doubt. And as soon
as I like opened that door like, &#34;Hey,
you hurt me, but maybe that wasn&#39;t your
intention. Maybe your intention was
else.&#34; He filled that void with his
story and his message and and what he
wanted me to understand about himself.
And I mean, one of the wildest things
about this book is that I talk about
like I do not sugarcoat what I went
through like and especially what he did
to me. Like I very like clearly set out
like here&#39;s the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] he said
about me in court. Completely without
evidence like totally made up [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like and it ruined my life, right?
Here&#39;s what it
is. Acknowledge these facts. And also
and also here is a person who might have
had like in doing so might have been
coming from a place of trying to
rationalize things in his own mind which
is a thing that we all do. We all do on
a on a regular basis. We&#39;re all just
sort of interpreting our reality in the
way that suits us. And so
I and I wrote this book from my
perspective. I translated the entire
thing into into Italian before it ever
got published so that I could share it
with him so that he would know what I
was saying about him in public, what was
imminently going to come out. And his
was, &#34;I have never felt more
seen.&#34; That&#39;s what he told me. That
sounds like something a teenage girl
would say. Well, that&#39;s an interesting
observation.
um because it&#39;s become
quite emotional
um especially on his part.
Um I don&#39;t I I shouldn&#39;t go there too
much. Um
you&#39;re protecting his privacy. That&#39;s
hilarious. Yeah. AG1 has been a longtime

Yeah, you&#39;re a very nice person. You&#39;re
so much nicer than me.
Well, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve just had really
bad stuff happen to me and like I don&#39;t
wish bad stuff upon other people. And
that&#39;s a beautiful way to live your
life. It really is. I mean, that&#39;s uh
what all Christians aspire to is what
you&#39;re doing.
Yeah. Uh I I guess I&#39;m not a Christian.
Radical forgiveness. Yeah. You know, and
it&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t really set out for
people like point to that. They&#39;re like,
&#34;Forgiveness, forgiveness. You&#39;re doing
forgiveness.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Is this
forgiveness or is this just
communicating with him is forgiveness in
some way and not having extreme anger?&#34;
Well, that&#39;s the thing. I do have
extreme anger. Like that&#39;s all part of
it. Um, and this is where like the
Buddhist in me comes out
where you you can have extreme anger
towards a person and at the same
time hold them in your hand as this like
tender, fallible
creature that is capable of violence
against you, but is also capable of
being hurt. Just because someone hurt
you doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not
capable of being hurt. And I certainly
don&#39;t want to be in the position of
hurting someone. Like that&#39;s just who I
am. And if anything, like one thing that
I&#39;ve communicated to him is like, look,
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re ever going to
really wrap your head around what you
did to me.
Um, but if you do one day,
um, I know that you&#39;re going to feel
really, really bad. And I just want you
to know that
I I
I don&#39;t wish suffering on you. I don&#39;t.
Did you ask him if he had gone over any
of his previous cases and wondered
whether he did the same thing to other
people? because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
something you do once. I don&#39;t think you
are an ethical prosecutor who just
really objectively analyzes the evidence
and puts forth a case based on what you
think is the facts. Mhm. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
think you do that your whole career. And
then this 20-year-old [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I think
she&#39;s too cute. I don&#39;t like how she&#39;s
smiling. Yeah, there. Yeah, there was
that element to it, wasn&#39;t there? Well,
yeah, I think that and I do feel like
there was some kind of
pornographic nature to it like I don&#39;t
know like I think that men Well, there&#39;s
a lot of men that have like a deep
resentment for beautiful women
just from feelings of rejection or Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. because they are
attracted to them or they find them to
be beautiful or desirable and they know
that that woman wants to have nothing to
do with them. Like they are completely
repulsive. And so that you you see it a
lot with unfortunately unattractive men.
They develop a hate for women. I&#39;ve seen
it I&#39; I&#39;ve seen it evolve over years
with people that I used to be friends
with. you know, like just constant
rejection and then it becomes like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
these women and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] them. They just
want this like, okay, put yourself in
their position. You&#39;re
gross. Like, what are they supposed to
do? Try harder. What are they supposed
to do? Like, be with someone that
they&#39;re not attracted to to make that
person feel better. Like, that&#39;s not
what people do. Like, you have a short
window of life. Yeah. Yeah, you&#39;re
supposed to pursue what you like and
you&#39;re, you know, your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hand of
card sucks. Sorry. You know, this is how
it goes. But that thing where you know
they look at you like you have it too
easy. You have too many gifts. There&#39;s
life has given you too good a hand of
cards, you know, and you should be
punished. You should be knocked down a
peg. You see that in particular in the
media with celebrity. It&#39;s a big one
with celebrity women. If something goes
wrong, like they just can&#39;t wait Oh,
yeah. to dunk on them, mock them for
weight gain, whatever it is. For getting
out of a car in the wrong way and they
they were the ones who were like showing
up to get up their skirt. Yeah. Any any
sort of That stuff was on purpose. Oh,
is it? Yeah. I think the Paris Hilton
stuff like back in the day where a lot
of women were like it was like an
epidemic of girls getting out and
photographers just happened to be on the
ground like you&#39;re a woman you&#39;ve worn
skirts. It&#39;s not easy to look up
someone&#39;s skirt if you&#39;re standing up
and someone gets out there. How the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
do you get down there? You you&#39;d have to
be on your knees. I think they were
doing it on purpose. I think it was a
way of going viral before viral was a
thing cuz it went away. Like when was
the last time that we had an up the
skirt shot? Why don&#39;t you have any
underwear on? That seems weird. Well,
panty lines, you know, that&#39;s a real
thing. Uh, yeah, sure. But that&#39;s what
g-strings are invented for, right? Those
still create lines, my friend. Depends
on the dress. Yes. But I mean, are you
that concerned with lines that you want
to go bearback? I&#39;ve not gone bear back
uh at a at a premiere. I have a little
skirt on hopping out of a car. And the
way they did it, it&#39;s just I think it
was like uh you know the same people
that had sex tapes that leaked air
quotes that were engineered. I mean the
whole thing was it was on purpose like
Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. But in but in
terms of your of like trying to take
beautiful women down a peg, I think
you&#39;re right. I also think that
something that was going on um in my
case that I think you also tend to see
in those situations where you&#39;re trying
to take beautiful women down a peg is
this idea of like pitting women against
each other. Um like that was a huge
thing in my case where they were
suggesting that, you know, here I was
this like free-spirited but also hory,
you know, American girl versus the
uptight, judgmental British girl. and
and therefore they hated each other and
with you know with a vengeance with a
lethal vengeance and then then this idea
of like a murder orgy appeared where
this pornographic fantasy of women ex
expressing their own violent fantasies
towards each other in real life and
using men as pawns in that in that game
of of violent hatred towards each other.
I think you see that a lot. um you know
even in like a person that I I write
about in this book who&#39;s become a a dear
friend of mine is Monica Lewinsky and
how I feel like people really wanted to
bring her down a peg in part because
they wanted to bring Hillary down a peg
and the whole like p the person who
actually committed the affair was sort
of I mean he definitely got his part but
it was all like a political game of
they&#39;re trying to take down the man but
they&#39;re also taking down on the women
and they&#39;re especially railroading this
young woman who made a mistake and it
became known as the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and not you know the the Bill
Clinton affair or whatever like it
matters what you name a thing and it
seemed like the legacy of that and the
person who became defined entirely by
that scandal happened to be Monica the
one who was the person with the least
amount of power and agency in that
equation and also 20 years old. Yeah. 23
years old. Yeah. Who did a very normal
thing, which was fall in love with a
charismatic, powerful man. And he was
handsome as [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] back then. Oh, yeah. I
mean, he was the president of the United
States. He was the president of the
United States. He was charismatic. He
was handsome. He showered her with
attention. And it makes sense that a
young inexperienced person would fall in
love with him. And yet, she was the one
who got railroaded. She was the home
wrecker. She was the the one who became
the subject of all the rap lyrics. and
her entire life and her entire identity
became identified with this mistake she
had made. And that was not the same
thing with the president of the United
States. And I think that that impulse to
define women by their worst moments and
to tear them down for their worst
moments is um is prevalent as from what
I have seen. I think because they know
it&#39;s so devastating to the person, you
know what I mean? It&#39;s like there&#39;s that
the bully instinct when they know that
you&#39;re weak and vulnerable, you know, to
attack, you know, but why? To what end?
People are cruel cuz they&#39;ve been hurt,
you know. It&#39;s the hurt people hurt
people thing, you know. I think it&#39;s
like shot and freed just as an audience
like we want we want a story. They want
a real life story where we get to, you
know, passively enjoy the destruction of
another human being, right? And also,
you don&#39;t know her, so you&#39;re
disassociated. Yeah. Right. Like, if she
was your friend and you did that, you&#39;d
have to be special kind of monster. Like
that woman, Linda Trip, like who did it
all, that&#39;s a special kind of monster,
right? Special kind of monster who trots
that out to the whole world to try to
take down Bill Clinton. Yeah. You know,
which didn&#39;t even work. No. And that&#39;s
what&#39;s fascinating. It it worked to
destroy Monica, right? But also like you
when you look at Bill uh Bill Clinton,
this uh handsome president, and then you
look at Linda Trip who is very
unattractive, that&#39;s also plays in like
I want to take him down too and probably
I want to take her down as well. Like
there&#39;s a lot of like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
everybody else. There&#39;s a lot of that,
you know, when you&#39;re, you know, you&#39;re
unseen to use the same vernacular, you
know, and then you see like other people
getting attention and it&#39;s just like the
fact that she did it and she knew her
and she but also this is like this is
the game of cards that they&#39;re playing.
This is House of Cards. This is you know
that this is literally what they do
anytime they have a chance in the
political realm to use any window, any
vulnerability, anything. It&#39;s the
dirtiest game in the world. It&#39;s a
disgusting game, you know, and if you
get sucked into it, you&#39;ll find that
out, you know. It&#39;s I don&#39;t want
anything to do with it. It&#39;s the most
evil. It&#39;s really is like when I see
people that are running for president,
I&#39;m like, what are you doing? I know.
Why would you do that to yourself? Yeah.
And then you have to spend the rest of
your life like with, you know, Secret
Service following you around so you
can&#39;t exist in the world as a normal
human being. like
that. I do feel like there is uh you
have to be a special kind of person in
order to be attracted to something like
that. Yeah. And and ironically that&#39;s
the kind of person that&#39;s attracted to
that in general is not the kind of
person you want in a leadership
position, right?
You know, which is like wow, what do we
do now? Yeah. Yeah. So is democracy uh
completely and utterly flawed because it
relies upon the ambition of uh the wrong
people or heroes or legitimate heroes
like someone who&#39;s like you know I&#39;m
going to tolerate this. I&#39;m going to
carry the burden of this on my back
because I think I can help people. But
does anyone ever like actually arrive at
the pre like at the seat of the
president as that person? Like I here&#39;s
the question. Do they stay that person?
Because I used to think Obama was that
person. I really did, you know. I was
like, &#34;Wow, we got a good one, you
know.&#34; And then I was sad I missed out
on that. Yeah, it was pretty cool. But
in retrospect, you know, when looking
back, like probably not really like
probably got corrupted by the system or
was corrupt originally,
you know, and is now willing to openly
lie. God. Yeah. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s dark. It&#39;s
dark, you know, and I think
um it&#39;s just
a it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange social position
that I don&#39;t think is manageable for
anyone. I don&#39;t think the human mind is
prepared to be in that kind of a
position of power and not have it
completely distort what you are. And
then there&#39;s the relationships that you
have to have with all these various
politicians and then special interest
groups and lobbyists and then foreign
leaders and then yeah, how do you manage
all of that? Heads of defense contract
companies like what?
Can I tell you a story? Yes, please.
So, this story didn&#39;t actually make it
in my book, but it is one that
I wanted to tell you because it it talks
about how my weird relationship with
other people who are in positions of
power like police officers, right? Like,
you know, I&#39;m a I&#39;m an advocate of
criminal justice reform. Um, I talk a
lot about like I go and testify in front
of my, you know, state Congress trying
to get certain laws passed to protect,
you know, innocent people. And one thing
that I like to point out is that I&#39;m not
anti- law enforcement. Um, if anything,
I was a victim of crime before I became
a victim of the criminal justice system.
Like, someone broke into my home and
raped and murdered my roommate. And then
I called the cops and then the cops went
on to betray me. And but that doesn&#39;t
mean that there isn&#39;t like I&#39;m not one
of those, you know, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] all the police,
we don&#39;t need them, you know, abolish
the whole system. That&#39;s not what I
Um but as as someone who has had this
complicated experience with police, um I
don&#39;t really know what to do when
something bad goes down. And I want to
tell you a story about something bad
that went down. Um, it was in LA. I was
staying at a friend&#39;s house with my
husband and our two kids. We were doing
work down there and our friends were not
there. But, um, in the middle of the
night, we hear someone yelling out in
the, you know, out in the street. We
think there&#39;s some drunk guy out there,
but it gets closer and closer and closer
until finally there is a huge bang. Um,
and my husband gets up in his tidy
whiteies and says one thing to me, call
the police before he marches downstairs.
We were upstairs in the second story and
we hear a bang. We hear yelling. He goes
down there in his underwear and I don&#39;t
know if the last thing I&#39;m ever going to
hear from my husband at that point is
call the police, which is an interesting
final words to get from the love of your
life when you&#39;re me. And my my, you
know, infant son is crying. My, you
know, 2-year-old daughter at the time is
going, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; And I&#39;m trying
to calm him while reassure her while
looking around the room thinking, &#34;How
do I barricade a door? And can I jump
out of a window with two small
children?&#34; All of that before I think
dial 911 because the last time that I
dialed the equivalent of 911 to call for
help, I got thrown into prison.
I realize that there&#39;s nothing I can do
to protect my kids. So, I call
911 and eventually, you know, my husband
is able to get this intruder to leave
the house. Um, the police arrive and I
have a very strange encounter with them
because they are very nice to me and I
was not expecting that and they are very
nice to my daughter and they give her a
nice little, you know, police badge and
I&#39;m sitting here thinking great, now I&#39;m
going to have to throw a police themed
birthday party for her cuz now she&#39;s
going to be super into police and I&#39;m
just like what is happening to my life?
And I&#39;m scared that they&#39;re going to
recognize me and I&#39;m scared they&#39;re
going to think maybe she faked a break
in like all of that is going on in my
and I don&#39;t know how to resolve
that of you know somebody broke
into I have you know broke into my home
once murdered my roommate broke into the
place I was staying again thankfully
didn&#39;t murder
anybody but like how do I make sense
of my relationship with people who are
empowered to protect me but also are
empowered to hurt me. What do I do about
that? You tell me, Joe. What do I do?
There&#39;s no way I could know what&#39;s going
through your mind.
You know that the experience that you
is no one can even pretend
to have those thoughts in their head
because this is not just paranoid
fantasy. This is this is your actual
lived experience for
years. Yeah, that&#39;s a good question.
What what had happened like the bang?
Was it someone kicking down the door?
Yeah, he had kicked in the door through
the deadbolt. What was the yelling? The
yelling was he was just uh
schizophrenic. Yeah. He he thought that
he someone had stole that house from him
and he was yelling for some name of a
person who didn&#39;t live there. Clearly
was just like either confused or
mentally ill in some capacity.
Um but and thankfully not armed, but
like my husband didn&#39;t know when he
walked down the stairs in his underwear
without any any like he grabbed a broom
on his way down and that was he was
between putting himself and a broom
between whoever this person was who had
just kicked in the front door through
the deadbolt and his family.
Um, and that might have been the last
time I ever saw him, you know, and I did
not know what to do. I try to like joke
about it now where I actually did a
standup bit about it a while back about
how I was like testing my butt to see if
it was bouncy enough to like jump out of
the window and bounce. But like I when I
think back on it, it&#39;s just it&#39;s still
scary, you know?
Um, and and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like how I
feel right now that when I&#39;m scared, I&#39;m
supposed to call the police, but I&#39;m
also scared to call the police. Jesus.
And so, you know, when I go and do
advocacy work for, you know, I&#39;m I&#39;m now
on the board of an organization called
the Innocence Center, um,
innocencecenter.org, which by the way
just got a bunch of federal funding uh
taken away. Thanks Elon. Um you&#39;d think
that they would be interested in
supporting organizations that clean up
the messes of the criminal justice
system, but apparently not. Um so if you
want to support us, innocencecenter.org.
How did what what happened that they got
their funding taken away? What what was
the circumstances like? Uh I mean there
there&#39;s a federal funding that is
designed for innocence organizations and
I think what I heard is that there are
certain words that sort of became taboo
within the um
administration that if you were using
these words or these terminologies that
they associate with like DEI that then
they&#39;re that sort of puts you on the
list of being cut for federal funding.
And one of those words was like the word
fair. And in a organization that is
interested in justice and for in getting
innocent people out of prison, the word
fair is going to come up quite a bit. So
is it just an algorithm? They&#39;re just
scanning the mission statement of
whatever these organizations are. Yeah.
I mean, I think that that&#39;s a first a
first step is they&#39;ll just use this.
They&#39;re going to use algorithms and AI
to help them identify potential things
to cut. And I think as a as a new
innocence organization, we were
considered not worthy of the federal
funding that we have relied on and to
help innocent people. And now are you
one of the founders of this
organization? Me? No, I&#39;m on the board.
Um, but yes, this is um formerly the
California Innocence Project that has
since sort of turned into the Innocence
Center. But you&#39;ll see you&#39;re seeing
this all across the board of innocence
projects of getting their federal
funding taken away. And there&#39;s no
accusations of impropriy or misuse of
funds or high salaries for certain
individuals or
nothing. Nope. Just it&#39;s deprioritized
because I think we&#39;re considered leftist
organizations potentially. I don&#39;t know.
Um, but I know that
like I have always thought that
innocence and getting and justice were
bipartisan issues and I thought that we
had been making great, you know, strides
in in sort of welcoming in both liberal
and conservative partners in this
ongoing fight. But because these sort of
these things disproportionately impact
people of color, you&#39;re going to
see language around that that
acknowledges that fact. And I think that
that has been sort of put in we are
innocence organizations are now being
put into DEI camps and we&#39;re being
stripped of funding. And I think that
that&#39;s I hope that that&#39;s an oversight
issue um and that they&#39;re going to
recognize the mistake that they&#39;re
making. But as it stands right now,
innocence organizations, not just the
one that I&#39;m associated with, are
scrambling to get the funding that they
were promised to
continue doing, you know, doing the
things that cost money, like filing, you
know, filing all of their work and and
going through all of the case work and
doing the DNA tests and doing
investigations to see if you can reach
the witnesses that maybe have changed
their stories in all these years. takes
a lot of money and resources to prove a
person&#39;s innocence. You have to
reinvestigate a case and we&#39;re we don&#39;t
we don&#39;t have the funding that we we
used to. This episode is brought to you

Josh Dubin. Mhm. And you know Josh?
Yeah. I mean, I&#39;ve never met him
personally, but he&#39;s with the he was
with the Innocence Project and now he&#39;s
with the Ike Prutter Center for Legal
Justice and it&#39;s same kind of work.
Ironically, Ike Prutter is very close
friends with Trump. Huh. And so I mean I
would have thought that that would have
been of interest to Trump considering I
think it&#39;s a baby with the bathwater
type deal where there&#39;s a lot of what
you would call almost like slush fund
NOS where they&#39;re
inappropriately moving funds around and
doing stuff. And I don&#39;t know if you
ever seen any of Mike Benz&#39;s work, but
he essentially says that US A is really
there to do things that are too dirty
for the CIA. So the extraordinary amount
of money that was being moved around,
there&#39;s a certain percentage of it that
was inappropriately being used. I
imagine so. Yeah. Yes. An enormous
percentage. There&#39;s it&#39;s a lot of m. But
unfortunately, there&#39;s a lot of good
that also is coming out of that money.
And that&#39;s what&#39;s difficult. That&#39;s
like, you know, when you round up uh all
the quote unquote gang members, right,
and you fly them to El Salvador, are you
sure? Yeah. They&#39;re all gang members, or
do you care? Right. Exactly. I think do
you care or is it just like we&#39;re just
here to clean things up and if And if we
throw it in make an omelette, right? our
are innocent people the price of us
getting to be efficient. Don&#39;t become a
monster when you&#39;re fighting monsters.
Yeah. And that&#39;s what I think we&#39;re
we&#39;re brushing up against right now. And
um and as someone who really is like
just interested in keeping especially
this issue like this is a human like we
all we all should be on the same side
about this. Um, yeah. Why, like, why is
it being turned into this a left or
right issue? And well, maybe I can get
this in front of Josh and he can present
it to some people and, you know, have
them reconsider their position. That
would be great. I I would you know and
if you need put me in contact like I
would be happy to you know one of the
things through working with Josh and you
know just through this podcast we&#39;ve
gotten a lot of people released um that
were wrongfully convicted and you know
when you go over the amount of
corruption that&#39;s involved and I I think
there&#39;s an
issue with uh human beings whenever
there&#39;s a binary position, a one or a
zero. You win or you lose. Yes. The
adversarial system where it&#39;s like I
have to be I have to win this side and I
cannot at all like acknowledge some
truth that might be to the other side.
Like and then you have this game where
you hire like if you are a guilty
person, you hire the best defense
attorneys that probably even know you&#39;re
guilty, but their job is to get you off
by any means necessary to Well, their
job is to make the government prove your
guilt, right? That&#39;s what a technically
a defense attorney who&#39;s really good,
right? But that&#39;s not really what
they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re trying to get you
out of jail. Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Yeah. Yeah. The goal being if you can&#39;t
actually prove it then well their goal
is to win as often as possible so that
they&#39;re the person like this this is the
guy you want you know although I have
talked to some really interesting
defense attorneys
um the defense attorneys who represented
Larry Nasser for example um famously for
those who don&#39;t remember was uh
molesting young gymnasts. Do you
remember him? The Olympics guy. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. And I I interviewed them
because it was two women who represented
him. And so a lot of people were like,
&#34;How dare you represent this man as a
woman? How could you?&#34; And their
position was, &#34;Well, we didn&#39;t represent
him to prove him innocent. We we had him
plead guilty to these crimes. We just
feel that everyone deserves to have a,
you know, a defender. We&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re
defenders. We we represent people in in
the law.&#34; and they were getting like
demonized for even taking him on as a
client. And I thought that was
interesting because they weren&#39;t trying
to get him off. They were just trying to
have to to represent due process. And I
I felt like that was a really
interesting case
of people
confusing the the what what is the role
of a defense attorney? And I think
you&#39;re right, like some defense
attorneys really don&#39;t care if their
clients are are guilty or innocent
because they are also in this
adversarial system and so they are also
in this position of just wanting to win
and and wanting to make the lives of,
you know, law enforcement difficult and
they&#39;re willing to throw victims under
the bus in the process. Like I&#39;ve had
really frank conversations with um with
friends of mine in the in the innocence
world where they talk about how they
were trained to just destroy a victim in
order to to diminish their credibility
in court and and to really put them in a
a really bad position so they didn&#39;t
want to pursue justice for themselves.
And I think that and they look back and
go, &#34;Oh my god, I can&#39;t believe that
that&#39;s how I was trained to be a defense
attorney.&#34; But like that was just part
of the game. And I think that&#39;s where
this whole course of justice gets
completely distorted because it&#39;s like
well what is the what is the point of
all of this? Like it should be about
like arriving at the truth and then
doing and then having there be like some
recognized consequences for
acknowledging what really happened. we
need to address the issue which is
somebody got hurt by someone else. What
do we do? Now what? And instead it&#39;s
become well I&#39;m going to win like I&#39;m on
this team you&#39;re on this team fight.
Let&#39;s see who wins. And as a result the
the whole issue of truth gets distorted
and and becomes about making the best
story that that captures the people&#39;s
attention. And I think I mean that was a
huge lesson for me was realizing that
like the truth didn&#39;t matter. Like
nobody cared about the truth. They cared
about the story and was it a story that
spoke to them and was it a story that
lingered for them? And that&#39;s, you know,
an ongoing thing that I I I write about
is like, okay, here&#39;s this crazy story
that is not true that took over my life
and that still has this huge role like
I&#39;m still in conversation with that
crazy story that was written about me
and and the fact that like my entire
identity is now wrapped up in the death
of my friend that I had nothing to do
with and I&#39;ll forever be defined by
because it&#39;s such a cap. captivating
story and because the prosecutor
was dead set on winning and wasn&#39;t
necessarily interested in the truth.
what he says and it&#39;s very it&#39;s again it
goes back to like what are we telling
ourselves and what is what is the
cognitive bias and I think this is where
it gets super interesting
winning is interpreted in some people&#39;s
minds as doing their duty right like the
way that my prosecutor has always talked
about it with me is that he maintains
that he was doing his duty. He this was
his job. His job was
to make a case that made logical sense
to him based upon certain
premises and then to win that case in
court. That was his job. That was his
duty. And he believes that he was doing
the right thing because that was that&#39;s
what he was trained and incentivized to
do. In the same way that like you know
journalists if you ask journalists back
who covered the case back in the day
they&#39;ll be like well we were doing our
job our job was to sell the best story
that we could to our audience and right
and but and so that&#39;s when it gets like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up cuz like how how have our
institutions that we&#39;ve relied on to be
truth seeeking institutions been
corrupted from the inside by ultimately
what is a question of like money or or
power. Um, when politics gets brought
into the the equation with criminal
justice, suddenly, you know, your
prosecutor is now wanting to win cases,
not because they&#39;re the right cases to
win, but because they want to be
elected. Like, all of that
gets distorted and and the the
motivations behind all our institutions
become warped. Well, the but the with
the media, it&#39;s even more disgusting
because it&#39;s not about politics. It&#39;s
literally just about getting people to
pay attention to their story, right? And
buy newspapers or click on links, right?
That&#39;s it. Right. And then they hold
then they hold their the audience
accountable for the kinds of stories
that they are then incentivized to
write. They say, &#34;Well, you know, I
wouldn&#39;t been writing the story if you
weren&#39;t clicking on it.&#34; And and it&#39;s
like this vicious cycle. That&#39;s crazy.
It&#39;s like I wouldn&#39;t have robbed your
house if you didn&#39;t have nice stuff.
Exactly. Exactly. That&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] crazy.
But like that&#39;s how if you&#39;re in that
little echo chamber of a system and
that&#39;s what your reward structure is. Of
course that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to end
up delivering if you&#39;re somebody who&#39;s
not who doesn&#39;t have the introspection
to question like okay wait what am I
doing and what is the point of all of
this and do you have certain principles
but again the people who rise to the top
are maybe the ones who are willing to
question those principles in order to
achieve certain ends. Yes. Yeah. And
then there&#39;s also the problem with
you&#39;re working for a corporation if
you&#39;re in the news. If you&#39;re not an
independent journalist who has like rock
solid personal ethics, you&#39;re working
for a corporation and your job is to
make money for your shareholders
ultimately. And the way you do that is
to get as many people to click on those
links as possible. And maybe the person
who&#39;s on the ground has a certain vision
for what they want their like on the
ground reporting to do. But then once it
gets in the hands of editors and other
editors, like it becomes completely
warped from the thing that they were
originally reporting on because the
person who&#39;s over here is so divorced
from the actual on the ground story and
they know instead the story that&#39;s going
to sell. Yeah. So yeah, it&#39;s dark. I
mean, it&#39;s the same sort of distortion.
Excuse me.
Salute. Sorry. It&#39;s the same sort of
distortion um with when you were talking
about prosecutors
um just trying to win. It&#39;s this it&#39;s
this thing where and
ultimately
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a a severe distortion of
what the best case scenario is. The best
case scenario is prosecutors don&#39;t care
about winning. They care about finding
truly guilty people. And in cases where
someone, whether they uh withhold
evidence that could have exonerated an
innocent person or whether they distort
things or twist things around in order
to win, they should be forever removed
from that system. You should never be
allowed to do that.
But this is Kla Harris did that and rose
to be vice president and almost became
president and she is absolutely guilty
of doing that. Yeah, I know it&#39;s she
tried to withheld withhold DNA evidence
that would have exonerated someone. I
know she was not a popular choice among
the innocence community. I&#39;ll tell you
that. Oh yeah. No. Josh Dubin broke her
down on my show but when she was here
president No. Okay. No. No. No. No.
broke down what she was guilty of when
she was a prosecutor in California.
Yeah. No, it it wasn&#39;t. And that&#39;s why I
was so mad that our party never actually
gave us a choice. Right. Right. There
was no primary. No, there was no
primary. They were just like, &#34;Here&#39;s
the person now.&#34; And and if you don&#39;t
vote for her, you&#39;re a bad person.
Exactly. You&#39;re a fascist. Yes. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. No, it was that that this
whole But then again, that&#39;s also just
trying to win. Yeah. It&#39;s the same kind
of thing. It&#39;s just the the focus is on
winning. Yeah. At what cost? I mean, and
then that&#39;s a very slippery slope
because if you&#39;re willing to accept
that, guess what? Guess what? That that
slope keeps slipping. Mhm. And then next
thing you know, you know, yeah, you
don&#39;t have breaks, right? You have to
put a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] blinder on because you&#39;re
you&#39;re part of the problem. You&#39;re part
of what&#39;s destroying society. So then
you have to like reshape your own
personal narrative and lie to yourself
about what you&#39;re doing and why you&#39;re
doing it, right? a little bit of like
self brainwashing. Yeah. Um, and that
fascinates me like in conversations with
my prosecutor, how how has he convinced
himself that he&#39;s the good guy and and
how has that changed when I have
approached him not as an adversary but
as someone who is
uh I wouldn&#39;t say like tolerant because
I&#39;ve never put myself in a position of
sort of saying, &#34;Oh, what you did was
not a big deal.&#34; Like when I approached
him, I was like, &#34;What you did was a big
deal and you were wrong and you hurt
people.&#34; But like acknowledging his
humanity and the complexity of him and
acknowledging that like he&#39;s not an evil
person. Um well, what is evil?
Intentional malice. Maybe that seems
like he was doing it intentionally if he
was paying attention to the facts of the
case. I mean, there was DNA evidence.
There was all sorts of stuff that
pointed to you not being the guilty
party, and they ignored that. If that&#39;s
not evil, I mean, what he did, it&#39;s
interesting. um he wrote a whole book
about the case and he talked about how
when he first arrived at at the scene,
he immediately knew that it was a
conspiracy because he looked at the the
broken window, how the person had
actually broken into our home and said,
&#34;There&#39;s no way, zero chance that a
burglar would have broken in to a house
this way.&#34; He just was like 100%
convinced that immediately that the
break-in was staged. And if you take
that, if if you and your brain truly
believe that, then what logically
follows is a lot of what he then came up
with. Well, someone in the house is
trying to cover up for a crime that they
were involved in. Who lives in that
house? Well, there are three other
girls, one of whom was in Rome, one of
whom is another Italian girl who was
with her boyfriend and friends, and one
of whom is the American girl who was
with her boyfriend that night, but who
also happened to be the one who called
the police and brought attention to the
house. So maybe because we found her at
the scene of the crime, may like all of
it sort of starts to like make logical
sense if you begin with a false premise.
How did he reconcile that in the book?
In his book? Yeah. I mean, he he makes
logical leaps. So, he goes, &#34;Okay, well,
then we discovered that, you know, all
of this DNA of the person who actually
committed the crime, right? Like, you
know, they they finally get the DNA back
and it&#39;s all pointing to this guy who
has a history of breaking and entering
and and aggression towards women.&#34; And
he doesn&#39;t go, &#34;Oh, no, we made a
mistake.&#34; He goes, &#34;Oh, how can now he
be involved in this thing that I know
Amanda&#39;s involved in because I know the
break-in was staged.&#34; And you know like
so these the this is how a person with
good with genuinely good intentions can
can have false beliefs that then logic
from which one can logically derive an
insane story that requires like him to
now believe like one of the things that
I pointed out to him that just like
drives me nuts that he continues to like
somehow hang on to is this idea that I
was in a threesome with like I was in a
three-way way relationship with my
actual boyfriend Raphael and this
burglar Rudy GDay. And I was like,
&#34;Where are you coming up with that?&#34; And
he was like,
&#34;Well, whenever I interviewed Rudy, like
he talks about interviewing, you know,
interrogating Rudy, Rudy always seemed
to have affectionate things to say about
he always seemed to like be interested
in you.&#34; And from that, I can logically
deduce that you guys had a relationship.
And I was like, we we like I didn&#39;t even
know his name. There&#39;s no record of us
ever communicating with each other. No
one ever like saw us hanging out with
each other. Like what are you talking
about? And he&#39;s like, well, if he was
involved in the crime and you&#39;re
involved in the crime and he&#39;s sort of
talking about, you know, you in an
affectionate way, then logically it
makes sense that you were in this, you
know, three-way relationship with
Raphael and Rudy. And I&#39;m like, that&#39;s
not true. And he was like, &#34;Well, that&#39;s
what it&#39;s that&#39;s what made logical sense
to me at the time.&#34; I think the issue is
an egotistic idiot that has power.
That&#39;s really what I think it is.
Certainly someone who has a belief and a
confidence in their own abilities as a
logical thinker. And I think anyone who
is in that kind of position has to
believe in themsel in that kind of way.
But not just that, like you have too
much power. Like there&#39;s not enough
oversight. You have too much power. And
then you say something and if your
initial assertion is incorrect, you then
have to defend it. So then you do mental
gymnastics to try to defend it at the
expense of your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] life. Yes. He
was willing to put you away forever.
Like he had to know at some point in
time in the back of his stupid brain. He
had to know that you were innocent. and
he was willing to push forward and
concoct some sort of a three-way
relationship narrative that he still
sticks to. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that guy.
Well, and and sometimes that&#39;s what my
brain says. You know, sometimes I Your
brain should say that, you know? I mean,
forgiveness is really important, but
some people you just can&#39;t forgive. Like
some people it&#39;s like, no, you need to
come to grips with the fact that you&#39;re
a piece of
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong here. It&#39;s not
me forgiving you and you having this
hall pass to just to be a piece of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
because you had this theory that you&#39;re
still accusing me of. No, that&#39;s that&#39;s
not you&#39;re bad at what you do. And
sometimes people are bad at what they
do. Sometimes you get bad teachers, you
get bad cops. Sometimes you get a bad
electrician, your house catches fire.
Some some people suck at what they do.
and to like have this like eternal
forgiveness like sometimes it&#39;s not
smart to do that. Well, certainly. And I
and I think that&#39;s He&#39;s still working as
a prosecutor. No, no, he&#39;s retired. He
he has retired. He should be in jail.
Like literally, I do not wish jail upon
him. I don&#39;t Okay, that&#39;s sweet. But
that&#39;s crime. Like what he did, it was
not just a crime, but it was a
conspiracy.
Yeah. I I um I would have to say that I
agree that there I always wanted to I
always wondered where the adults were in
the room like you know the whole first
two years of my imprisonment I was like
this is all a huge mistake and it&#39;s
really obviously a huge mistake and when
are when are like the mommies and
daddies going to show up and say okay
kids stop your squabbbling like let&#39;s
straighten things out there&#39;s no mommies
and daddies there are no mommies and
daddies That&#39;s the thing that freaked me
out is like we&#39;re all adults now and
this is all we are. We&#39;re just a bunch
of screaming toddlers just screaming at
each other constantly. And here I am now
I feel in a way trying to mother my
prosecutor through his, you know,
psychological tantrums. Um, which is a
weird position to be in. Um because now
that I&#39;ve, you know, developed the
relationship that I&#39;ve developed with
him, I I I like I care about him. Like I
don&#39;t think that you can I I set out to
understand him. I wanted to understand
him, but in the process of like really
understanding a human being and having
like be really open to you, I don&#39;t
know. I feel like you
inevitably begin to care about this
person even in their, you know, flawed
fragility as a human being. And so on
the one hand, I&#39;m very angry at him to
this day and on the other
hand, I I care about him and I have to
give him some props. He didn&#39;t have to
respond to me. He didn&#39;t have to meet
with me. He didn&#39;t have to sit there and
hear me talk about how he had [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up
my life and he shouldn&#39;t
have. I did not like it&#39;s not that like
me being kind to him does not mean me
tolerating injustice
and it does not mean me not setting
boundaries and it does not mean me
sugarcoating what really happened. like
he knows what I think really happened
and he says,
&#34;Well, you know, we can disagree about
our perspectives in some in some ways,
but ultimately what matters is that you
reached out to me and saw me as a human
being and in response I like I also
inevitably came to see you as a human
being and I care about
you and and so in a Hey, like we&#39;re
still in this
awkward dance of like one part of us is
stuck in that adversarial system and one
part of us is in a non, you know,
adversarial very like accepting of all
the things
space and we&#39;re paradoxically existing
in both of them at the same
time. And I think that that&#39;s just kind
of how life is. M like you know one of
the paradoxes of life is that like if
you really just sit down and and sit
with yourself and your life just the way
it is right now. If you really do just
like notice like right now you and me
here we are talking. We are okay. You
and me we are good. And also there&#39;s
still [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in my life and
there&#39;s still [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in your
life and and things could be better and
all of those things can be true at the
same time. like you know I&#39;m still
fighting to clear my name in Italy. I
don&#39;t know if you have you kept up with
like the latest with my case. Oh yeah.
So still so I&#39;ve been cleared of like
all the crazy you know horrible murder
orgy all of that stuff cleared. The
thing that remains and this is just the
bane of my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] existence is when
they cleared me of having anything to do
with the crime. They left open the
possibility that I was present when the
crime occurred. And I believe the reason
that they did this was because they
wanted to find me guilty of something.
And the thing that they found me guilty
of was the way lesser crime on the list
of all the crimes that were there, which
was slander.
They accused me of knowingly and
willingly falsely accusing an innocent
person of having committed this crime
because during my interrogation, I was
coerced into implicating myself and my
boss, Patrick
of of committing this crime and I
immediately retracted it, all of that.
But that was one of the things that they
were holding me accountable for. And
they to this day I am still convicted in
Italy of knowingly and willingly
accusing an innocent man. And for me to
knowingly and willingly accuse this
innocent man, I would have to have been
at the house and known who really was
the murderer at the moment that I
falsely accused this innocent person.
like I would have had to know that he
was definitively innocent for this to be
the case. And for that to be true, I
would have to be physically present at
the crime even if I was not
participating in it. So the legal
standing right now to this day is that I
was there and that when I was
interrogated, I knowingly and falsely
accused an innocent person. I appealed
this, by the way, to the European Court
of Human Rights, and they ruled in my
favor. They said that because I had been
denied the right of to have an attorney
and an an interpreter when I was being
interrogated that none of that should
ever have been I should never have been
convicted of that. And I took that back
to Italy. I took that ruling back to
Italy. And they overturned it. I was
actually acquitted of that for a second,
but then sent back for retrial recently.
And recently, yeah, this is 18 years
later. recently was put back on trial
for that. This was last year and I was
found guilty again. Oh my god. On the
basis not even of the statements that
the police like coerced me into signing,
but on my retraction. So I hand wrote a
retraction of those statements that the
police coerced me into signing. And I
was like, I&#39;m so confused. I can&#39;t
testify. Like I I I don&#39;t know if
Patrick did it or not. Like I just don&#39;t
know. And they said, &#34;Well, even a
confused statement where you&#39;re not sure
what the truth is if you were physically
present of the crime is is slander and
you falsely accused an an innocent man
that you knew to be innocent.&#34; And so,
but they have no proof that you were
there. Exactly. So, we&#39;re in this like
cyclical thing where they&#39;re like, they
just don&#39;t want to admit that they
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up. That&#39;s what I think. And I&#39;m
at this point where I&#39;m like, okay, now
what? Because I&#39;m definitively convicted
of this thing. And like the legal truth
in this case does not represent the
actual truth in this case. Are they
trying to protect themselves from some
sort of a civil suit? Maybe. Um I think
even more than that, I think they&#39;re
trying to protect themselves from
admitting that they tortured an innocent
girl. Oh my god. Oh my god. So, so they
can say, well, she is guilty. She did do
this. She&#39;s guilty. And so it&#39;s not
crazy for us to think that she might
have been involved in the in the murder
because here she is at least she
probably lied about being there and
Jesus Christ. And all they were ever
able to do is prove that I lived in the
house that this happened in. Like sure
my DNA is in my house. It&#39;s not anywhere
near Meredith&#39;s body or where the crime
occurred. But they&#39;re saying that like I
was there and it&#39;s sort of this like
cyclical sort of reasoning like Amanda
said she was therefore she was therefore
she said she was you know like it&#39;s this
like insane cyclical reasoning and I&#39;m
at the point where I have to ask myself
like how do I fight this and if so do I?
And that&#39;s where this whole question of
freedom comes in. like do I do I have to
definitively like prove my innocence in
a court of law to feel that I have
definitively proven my innocence or do I
need to definitively prove my innocence
in the court of public opinion in order
to feel free or to feel like I like I&#39;m
not regardless of whether I definitively
prove my innocence or not like am I ever
going to be free of this is this ever
going to be not touching me and
impacting my life and the answer that
I&#39;ve come to is well no in the way that
like any of our experiences have come to
define us as human beings and in a way
it&#39;s like another way of reframing this
is okay these are my credentials now
like I went to the I didn&#39;t go to four
years of P master&#39;s degree in poetry I
got a master&#39;s degree
in whatever this is being [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
you know,
like, you know, and and so like and I&#39;ve
learned things from this. I&#39;ve learned
I&#39;ve learned things about the criminal
justice system. I like I can see things
that need to be fixed that have are
really common sense fixes to like it.
There is no reason why we shouldn&#39;t be
just recording any kind of
communication. Like anytime that anyone
is being questioned by anyone in law
enforcement, there&#39;s no reason why we
shouldn&#39;t be recording it. And I&#39;m not
talking about even just suspects because
like there&#39;s been a whole, you know,
world of advocacy around like recording
interrogations, right? like custodial
interrogations and especially
um making it so that police officers
can&#39;t lie to you when you&#39;re being
interrogated because that was a huge
thing that impacted me as like a young
confused like overwhelmed human being is
police lying to me and telling me that
they have proof that I was there when
the crime occurred and it made me like
feel like I was insane. And so like the
problem of of police lying to you is not
just that it&#39;s like a bullying
technique, but it it warps your sense of
reality and you start to question
yourself. And so there&#39;s psychological
research to show that there are very
negative consequences for police lying
to you during interrogation. But at the
very least, if you record it, you can
sort of track how that is impacting uh a
person who is being who is a suspect.
The wild west of all of this is
eyewitnesses or anyone else who is being
questioned by police because there&#39;s no
Miranda rights. The like as a person who
is being questioned by police, you don&#39;t
have rights like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t
have like one of the things that they
say in my case is that I never had the
right to an attorney because I wasn&#39;t a
suspect. I was a witness. And so like to
this day in Italy there&#39;s like this
resistance to the idea that I was like
coerced into I was that I was even
interrogated at all because there&#39;s this
like little loophole where they say oh
you weren&#39;t interrogated you were
interviewed. Oh you weren&#39;t interviewed
you were questioned. They just changed
the language but what&#39;s ultimately
happening is the same thing. you are
stuck in a room with a law enforcement
officer who may or may not be lying to
your face and bullying you and you don&#39;t
know if you&#39;re free or not to go because
the door is closed and it doesn&#39;t feel
like it. And so for me, I think that if
you consider how many wrongful
convictions happened because of
misidentification by witnesses or the
number of times that like witnesses say,
&#34;Well, I wasn&#39;t really sure that it was
him, but the police sort of coaxed me or
pressured me into saying it was him and
let sort of made it known to me that it
was him.&#34; Like there are lots of things
that are happening behind closed doors
that we really don&#39;t have an excuse for
not fixing when every single one of us
has a recording device in our pocket at
all times. And the amount of resistance
to like getting just really common sense
changes like that to happen from like
law enforcement lobbies is just so
frustrating. as someone who like shows
up again and again and again to like try
to make because it seems like this
adversarial thing like we&#39;re we&#39;re all
on the same side. It&#39;s not like victim&#39;s
rights versus defendants rights. It&#39;s
not law enforcement versus you know
innocence. It&#39;s like we&#39;re all on the
same page. Why can&#39;t we just acknowledge
a true thing? Um, that&#39;s been one of my
frustrations in this world is like
feeling like we should all be on the
same side and we should be making common
sense changes and that don&#39;t, you know,
but it&#39;s the way the system is
structured, you know, there&#39;s two sides
trying to win and when you lose, you
don&#39;t like to lose and so people would
cheat to win. But like lose, what are
you losing? You know, but they&#39;re
playing a game. I mean, it&#39;s your life
and it&#39;s other people&#39;s lives. It&#39;s
innocent people&#39;s lives, but it&#39;s also
guilty people&#39;s lives. Like, but why
doesn&#39;t like a law enforcement officer
look at something that happened to me?
Actually, you know what? I take that
back. Plenty of law enforcement people
have talked to me and said like, &#34;We are
so sorry for what happened to you.&#34; The
ones who weren&#39;t
involved. That&#39;s the problem. The the
problem is, do you look away when you
involved? You know, how many law
enforcement officers will stick their
neck out if they think their partner
overstepped their boundaries and got
someone to admit to something that maybe
they did or didn&#39;t do, withheld evidence
that may or may not have exonerated
someone. Like there&#39;s steps along the
way on the road to evil, right? And and
no one gets rewarded for sticking their
neck out or for holding their friends
accountable. Yeah. you get exa I mean
you you
get excommunicated from your tribe it&#39;s
very dangerous you know the so how do we
motivate any other like how do you it&#39;s
a real problem it&#39;s a it&#39;s a giant
conundrum it&#39;s a real problem in in the
way this the system is structured and
the feeling that you have to like in
order to do the right thing you just
have to switch sides like that really
bothers me also because like one thing
that I have I would love to see more of
is more of like a collaboration between
victim&#39;s rights advocates and innocence
rights advocates. Um, but like oftent
times you see us sort of pitted against
each other as if like you
know I&#39;ve always felt that the the
criminal justice system never did enough
for victims.
um that like the only compensation that
victims are really given is the idea
that you&#39;re going to punish the
perpetrator. And I&#39;ve always wanted to
know how is the system how is the system
going to help the victim rebuild their
life and take back and like reclaim what
can be reclaimed of their experience and
and and be uplifted. And well that&#39;s
supposedly where the civil
supposedly but like you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re
suing the person who committed the crime
and are you ever actually going to get
any money from them? Are you like Well,
sometimes money is awarded to families
by the
state you know there&#39;s those but I mean
is that enough? Like is money&#39;s is that
enough? You know I don&#39;t think so. I
think that people need more support than
What is the support though? Like what
would make it right?
Well, I think overhaul the system. Yeah.
Really the only way to to truly make it
right is to find I mean if you&#39;re if
you&#39;re a person like I think your
approach to this all this radical
acceptance and forgiveness is very very
very beautiful. It&#39;s it&#39;s amazing that
you can do it. It&#39;s amazing that you
think the way you think. And you know I
used you as an example the other We&#39;re
having this conversation about um
uh horrible things that have happened to
people that have made that person a
beautiful person because you you went
through this insane thing, but on the
other end of it, you came out this like
really interesting person. Oh, very
much. You really are. You I used you as
an example
of things that don&#39;t break you, but that
you would never want to wish on anyone
else. But then the result of that is
this person comes out extraordinary.
Yeah. I mean that&#39;s a lot of the
obstacles the way kind of stuff. I mean,
it&#39;s a lot of stuff that I write about
in the book actually is one of the
things that my goal with this book was
to try to like yes, what happened to me
is like, oh, crazy story happened to a
girl one time, but also there are like
universal lessons and truths that I&#39;ve
derived from my from my experience that
make me and when I communicate them,
they make me feel less ostracized or
less like singled out as a human being.
And one of those is like there is
opportunity in every tragedy. Um, and I
think that what my tragedy challenged me
to do
was to not be broken by it. And my
definition of being broken by it was
coming out of
it. A person who was angry and and
embittered and and
diminished by this experience. And I
just the the rebellious side of me was
like, &#34;Fuck that. What matters to me?
What matters to me is the truth and is
compassion, curiosity, compassion. Those
are things that I genuinely care about.
and having the
to approach human beings and situations
that are painful and that are
wrong with the open heart that it
requires to have compassion and genuine
curiosity. That is what I wanted to
define me. I did not want this horrible
experience to define me on its terms. I
wanted to define me on my own terms. And
I think the challenge that any one of us
has is remembering what even our terms
are when we&#39;re feeling sort of
overwhelmed with the the existential
crisis of it all. And and the and the
and the I think the one of the biggest
mistakes that people make is they are
stuck. They are fixated. They dwell on
the life that they should have lived
of acknowledging and accepting that this
is the life that they are living. And
when you are acting in the world as if
you are living the life that you should
have lived, you are inevitably becoming
ineffective. Like if I were to approach
the world and be like, &#34;My prosecutor
never should have done this to me and
and my I I I never should have gone to
prison and people never should have
villainized me in the press.&#34; I would
just find myself debilitated, utterly
debilitated by the fact that reality is
other than that. And I would just find
myself angry and and and
and bitter about it all. And instead, I
&#34;Well, all of that happened. Now
what? And by accepting reality and life
as it is, I can now become in a more
effective agent in my life. I don&#39;t want
to live my life acting and feeling and
thinking in ways that are not going to
be effective. And so instead, what
happens and the radical acceptance of it
all is truly coming from a place
of not I&#39;m not trying to be Christian
about it. I&#39;m just trying to like not be
the completely and utterly overwhelmed
and dis-empowered person that I was when
I was in prison. Like I I lost so much.
I I had so little control of my
life. And I think in the end all of us
do. I feel like I weirdly had a midlife
crisis when I was 20 because my entire
life fell apart or I was on I was I was
put on this this track, this train that
just like left the station and was going
on its own and there was really nothing
I could do to stop it. And so, okay, now
what? That&#39;s a great way to put it. Like
you&#39;re on a train that you can&#39;t stop.
Yeah. I mean, what you&#39;ve done is
admirable. I mean the the the approach
that you take is really I mean if is it
admirable? Is it self- serving? Like is
it just like it&#39;s not self- serving. I
mean obviously it&#39;s self- serving but
that&#39;s a good thing. I mean you&#39;re
serving yourself in the best possible
way and to to not be completely defined
by you&#39;re being victimized. You you&#39;ve
risen above it. I mean, just the fact
that you contacted the prosecutor and
and tried to reach out and talk to him
as a human being and try to find out and
accept him where he&#39;s at. Yeah. Like
this is where you&#39;re at. Well, he&#39;s a
kind of a victim in in a way because he
shouldn&#39;t have had the kind of power
that he had. uh he there&#39;s no way to
tell like there there&#39;s no no checks and
balances that are put in place to make
sure the person&#39;s ego is not
overwhelming them to the point where
their initial idea of a conspiracy this
and he&#39;s also not in a vacuum like there
were other people around him who were
like building building him up and
supporting that story and and you know
like well it&#39;s also like he&#39;s in a
position of power they&#39;re underneath him
you know there&#39;s this weird structure
that&#39;s in place
yeah All of that can be true. Yeah. All
that and I can accept that as also true.
And I think there&#39;s this like weird
resistance that people have to accepting
the context around a person. Maybe
because you you realize that if you
accept the context around the person,
that feeling of self-righteousness that
you&#39;re ultimately grasping
onto dissipates because it does
inevitably dissipate. But I think that&#39;s
again a per that&#39;s a symptom of someone
dwelling on the life that they should
have lived right instead of accepting
the life that they have right um and I
just find that to be a waste of time. It
is not just a waste of time it&#39;s the
opposite of self- serving. It kind of
destroys you from within because you
know it&#39;s not true right. Yeah. And so
you&#39;re bullshitting yourself as you&#39;re
bullshitting the world and that&#39;s who
you are now. Yeah. that I think that is
a scary trap that victims can fall into
is like how you then become
selfdestructive in your own mind as a
result of someone having been
destructive towards you. That is I think
that is the deepest tragedy of of hurt
is how it can then become
implosive. And I did not want to
implode. I was scared to implode. I saw
a lot of people around me in prison
imploding and I did not want that to be
me. It&#39;s insane mental resolve to not
and that&#39;s it&#39;s the trap that most
people are going to fall into and in a
to a lesser extent he&#39;s a victim as
well. He&#39;s a victim of his own actions
and he&#39;ll it will haunt. I mean, he&#39;s
defined by that as well. Now,
particularly that everybody knows that
you&#39;re innocent and that you you&#39;ve been
proven innocent. And then in the
retrial, you got proven again. And so,
that&#39;s him. That&#39;s over his head.
Everywhere he goes, he wrongly
prosecuted and jailed you for a murder
you did not commit. And he has to live
with that every day when he wakes up and
he looks in the mirror. That&#39;s who you
are, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] forever. And you could dance
around, you know, I was doing my job and
this you can you can have, you know,
that&#39;s that&#39;s where you kind of try to
find some sort of No, no, you did this
thing. You were wrong. you, your ego,
whatever the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] it was that led you
to come up with the initial theory and
then try to use confirmation bias
to reinforce it at every step of the
way. That&#39;s you. And if if he doesn&#39;t
admit that, he will go to his grave
And I I think what&#39;s a really
interesting thing for me is
discovering what can come from
approaching someone recognizing that.
So when I approached him, I approached
him in a really unconventional way,
right? Like I&#39;m trying to find common
ground with this person. I&#39;m trying to I
very I&#39;m deeply genuinely curious about
this person. I am primed to feel
compassion for this person because that
is just the mental and intentional space
that I put myself
in approaching
him and the surprising dividends that
arise from that because I think everyone
evolving. No one is static. Even he is
on his own journey. He&#39;s on his own path
and I&#39;m not in control of his path. But
that doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t be a very
compelling influence of all the people
in the world who could be nice to him
and have that have an impact on
him. Me and like recognizing like I
didn&#39;t really fully comprehend that
until I sat down with him and like I had
sort of in my
mind I I realized what it looked like
from my position. like here&#39;s this
person who had this overwhelming impact
on my life and and to this day like
continually like this story that he made
up like took over my life and continues
to take over my life. Like this is what
I&#39;m going to live with for the rest of
my life is because of him. This person
who has had this outsized influence on
my well-being and my my personhood and
my existence. this
guy. I sit down across from
him and I&#39;m nice to
and I walk away from that encounter
realizing that his well-being depends on
me much more so than my well-being
depends on him. And I think because deep
down he understands that there is this
dynamic that you know whatever stories
he can tell himself about what
happened, he was the one who was in
power and I was the one who went to
And for
me to be kind to
him, I didn&#39;t have to do that.
He had never had it happen before. It
was unheard of. And as a spiritual
person, he experienced it in a spiritual
way. Me, I came out of that experience
feeling like a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] superhero. I have
never felt more powerful in my life than
when I sat across from him and was kind
to him. And it didn&#39;t matter what he
said or what he did because I showed
And that was I was not expecting that to
happen. That was not how I expected to
feel. It surprised
me. But like it had such an impact on me
that I felt like I had discovered
something about
about trauma and and about healing and
and about people and dynamics and in a
world that is so conflicted and where
the people are, you know, not building
bridges, they&#39;re blowing them up. I was
like I wanted to remind people of what
happens when you when you take a chance
and you take a stand.
Yeah. Well, that kind of kindness is
rewarded by the universe and that was
the feeling that you got like that you
were on the right path to like the best
possible person that you could be. What
would the best possible version of you
do? And you did that and then you had
that feeling because of that. That was
the universe telling you right this is
the best thing you can do. You could
yell at that guy and call him a piece of
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and slap him in the face and feel
justified in doing so. And you would be
and that might even feel a little good
in a way but it wouldn&#39;t feel like that
good. Yeah. Negativity
always, no matter what, leaves you with
residue, this like icky, even if you&#39;re
correct. This just like slime that&#39;s on
the psychic slime, right? That&#39;s on you
no matter what. Yeah. And that&#39;s your
power that you could sit across this
person and treat them with
compassion and that&#39;s why you felt that
You know, it&#39;s like, have you ever felt
that way? I&#39;ve never had anything
remotely like your situation.
But you&#39;ve had you&#39;ve had encounters
with people like I don&#39;t think you have
to have as devastating of a situation to
like be in a position to know that
you&#39;re doing the right thing in a
moment. Like for instance, when my
husband got up in his whitey tidies and
walked down the stairs to put himself
between me and my fam and his family and
this crazy guy, I feel like maybe he
felt that in that moment, like
total clarity of
and it didn&#39;t really matter what
happened because he was doing the thing
that had to be done in that moment. And
there was no confusion. I think that
like when I talk about it with him
today, like to this day, he&#39;s just like
I was just not confused. I just knew
exactly what I needed. I didn&#39;t even
think it it was that flow state even
that they talk about like how when like
you you and the universe are moving in
the exact in in sync. Yeah. And that
that was my version of it. That was his
version of it. And I think that all of
us have the opportunity to glimpse that
in our lives. And I&#39;m just curious if
you&#39;ve ever felt like you were moving in
sync with the universe. I try to be.
Yeah. But again, I haven&#39;t. You still
feel kind of slimy.
Well, I&#39;ve had moments where I haven&#39;t.
I&#39;ve had moments where I was very
negative and attacked back and I never
feel good about it. You know, it&#39;s one
of the reasons why I don&#39;t engage with
people online that are negative. I just
I don&#39;t you know especially particularly
like the lowest level of it is social
media you know uh I&#39;m not interested in
conflict. I&#39;m not interested in it. I
don&#39;t want to do it. You know even if
someone has negative things to say about
me I&#39;m not really interested in
engaging. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s valuable.
You know I think it&#39;s a trap. Yeah. But
it&#39;s not the same situation as what you
were in. I don&#39;t know how I would be. I
would cuz the other danger is
like you know I I don&#39;t want to consider
myself above criticism say like that&#39;s I
think the the other flip side of that of
like of having confidence is potentially
having the confidence that my prosecutor
had when was he feeling in sync with the
universe when he was prosecuting me? Did
he? Clearly not. There&#39;s no way. No.
That but that&#39;s not confidence. That&#39;s
ego. Confidence is an objective analysis
of all the
facts. Doing the right thing, having a
rock solid ethical and moral foundation
and knowing you&#39;re doing the right thing
and knowing you can do it. That&#39;s
confidence. What he had was ego. You
know, this desire to, you know, when
people are in a position like that where
freedom hangs on your decisions and what
you do and what you don&#39;t do and then
you do it for so many years and you see
so many people prosecuted, you just get
calloused about it. You see it with
doctors where doctors don&#39;t you know
they they have this some not all some
doctors develop this very callous
feeling whether someone lives or dies
they don&#39;t care anymore they&#39;re so used
to people dying you know I mean there&#39;s
doctors that do surgeries that are
completely unnecessary just because they
want the money you know we were talking
the other day about this guy who is a
oncologist who um treated people with
chemotherapy who did not have cancer
because he wanted the money. Wow. And it
was he was convicted. It was like I
think it was some insane number of
people took this horrible poison to try
to kill the cancer inside of them and
ruin their lives and ruin and and there
was nothing wrong with them. Wow. Yeah.
Because there&#39;s and I think his
justification was even more sick. His
justification was that he was always
taught that you eat what you kill. And
in that business in the business of
being a surgeon and a be business of
being a doctor like you have to perform
this medicine in order to get money and
this is the incentive structure that&#39;s
put in front of you. I don&#39;t know if you
know that but uh chemotherapy is one of
the most profitable things that a doctor
can prescribe. They actually get an
enormous amount of money from each
individual person that they Yeah.
There&#39;s there&#39;s all sorts of very
twisted and bizarre financial
incentives. Again, these institutions
that get warped by these various
Exactly. I mean, this is the case with
vaccinations. This is the case with
prescriptions of of various medicines.
There&#39;s kickbacks and these kickbacks
become incentives and you know and then
you have the overwhelming burden of the
financial responsibility that you have
with your medical school debt and then
you have uh malpractice insurance which
is overwhelming. You have overhead, you
have staff, you have a bunch of people
and then people start justifying things
in a very twisted way and it&#39;s because
of the system and you have to be an
incredibly powerful person to rise above
that and to say this is not what I&#39;m
going to do even if it means I can&#39;t do
this anymore. I&#39;m not doing this. And
then the the weakest amongst us just in
instead they go the other way and say
I&#39;ll justify what no one is going to
know. I&#39;ll say yeah you got cancer.
Yeah, I&#39;m sorry. you know, we&#39;re just
gonna I&#39;m gonna give her a low dose of
chemotherapy for like six weeks. Just
like, you know, whatever. No big deal.
Yeah. Just destroy your body from this.
And then just like this godlike power
that you know that you are imposing this
medication on this person that
absolutely does not need it and that
person doesn&#39;t know any better. Yeah,
that&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] dark. Um, well, you could
go darker. You go darker with medical
transition of children. you know, this
uh this whole gender affirming care
thing where you&#39;re taking young kids and
convincing them they need to be
chemically castrated or physically
castrated, right? There&#39;s that&#39;s there
there&#39;s a a lot of weirdness in in the
world. Yeah. Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of
there&#39;s evil is a real thing and that
the motivation to do these things can be
very very hidden and masked with all
sorts of incentives and the structure in
which this institution was sort of
created and that&#39;s that&#39;s the world
we&#39;re living in and it&#39;s not a good
world. It&#39;s not it&#39;s not a perfect
world, you know? It&#39;s not like this is
ideal. This is how it should be. No,
it&#39;s not like that. There&#39;s money is a
weird [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] thing. Money and power are
two very, very weird things. And
without some sort of a higher power that
you call upon or some sort of a higher
power that you are beholden to and that
you have to answer to, it&#39;s very
difficult for people to
make decisions if they know they&#39;re not
going to get caught. If they know
they&#39;re not going to get in trouble. If
you&#39;re a prosecutor and you&#39;re beyond
reproach and all you have to do and the
system protects you and everyone&#39;s
protecting you and not only that, once
the wheels are in motion, the train&#39;s on
the track, we can&#39;t turn the train
around. What do you want to do? Well,
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] train has to be on the
track. So, uh, she&#39;s got to go to jail,
I guess. Yeah. And there you go. Can I
tell you something I&#39;m conflicted about?
um, you know, my book&#39;s been out, uh,
for a month or so now, and I&#39;m also, you
know, working on, I don&#39;t know if you
knew this, I have a Hulu show that I&#39;m
working on that&#39;s based on my life. Um,
yeah, uh, Monica is executive producing
it. Monica Lewinsky is executive
producing it. Um, and I&#39;m really proud
of it. It&#39;s it&#39;s um it goes it&#39;s coming
out at the end of uh at the end of the
summer, late summer. And um but one of
the things that like one of the
responses that I&#39;ve had to my book and
to the you know the news that I&#39;m
telling my story in this way or in
another way and I write about this in
the book is this question of
um do I have the right to tell my story
and um what
who&#39;s saying that? Well,
um, people who believe that I&#39;m not the
real victim of the story. The real
victim is my roommate who was murdered.
And that unless I have the blessing of
Meredith&#39;s family to tell my story, that
I should shut up and disappear out of
respect. That&#39;s crazy. You&#39;re a victim.
Period. Full stop. No if ends, or buts.
You were 20 years old. I was 20 years
old. You&#39;re a victim. Period. You didn&#39;t
commit a murder. You went to jail for a
murder. You&#39;re a victim. Period. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
those people. Are they even real people?
Have you talked to those people? Are
they humans? I mean, have you been in
front of them or are you just reading
things? I mean, I reading things online,
journalists certainly who have
interviewed me. I I get this. I get this
a lot. I get this a lot. Um, from who?
from people who I feel like are
suffering from something I call the
single victim fallacy. This like idea
that like you have to decide who&#39;s the
real victim. Oh, there&#39;s a victim
hierarchy. You&#39;re not the greatest
victim because you&#39;re still alive,
right? You weren&#39;t raped and murdered,
so you&#39;re still alive, so you&#39;re fine.
Like, that is ridiculous. If that&#39;s a
journalist that&#39;s saying that to you, I
would just leave the room. I would be
like, well, well, I&#39;m trying to have a
conversation with these people about it
about that. That&#39;s a preposterous
position to tell a 20-year-old that went
to jail for years for a crime they
didn&#39;t commit and had their whole life
publicly publicly ruined worldwide in a
country you don&#39;t even live in or you&#39;re
not even from. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that person. That&#39;s
a crazy position. And if they&#39;re just
trying to do that
to, you know, just get a rise out of
you, to get a reaction, to try to like
they&#39;re bad. They&#39;re bad at what they
do. It&#39;s it&#39;s a bad person. The idea
that you&#39;re not a victim is
preposterous. That&#39;s a crazy position.
An actual human being sat in front of
you and was saying that. So, it&#39;s it
comes in different forms. So, some
people are very explicit and say
like, &#34;Don&#39;t you think you shouldn&#39;t be
doing this when the Kercher family&#39;s
lawyer says that you shouldn&#39;t be doing
this?&#34; And then it&#39;s So, they&#39;re saying
this to your face. Yeah. Yeah. And then
I have to sit
there and again do
like experience the rage that washes
over me and then go how do I have an
effective conversation with this human
being? How do I convey that my life
matters too and that there&#39;s room in
this world to acknowledge all of the
truth of what happened which included my
own victimization and my own story and
the things that I&#39;ve learned from it
that I&#39;ve had the privilege to learn
from it because I&#39;m still alive. That
that&#39;s such a crazy position. That&#39;s
like saying if you were in the Twin
Towers and you got out right before it
collapsed, you should shut the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up,
right? because you didn&#39;t because you
didn&#39;t die like all those other people
that were inside of it. That&#39;s
ridiculous. He&#39;s still your life. It&#39;s
still your real lived reality. And the
lawyer for the family that&#39;s telling you
that you shouldn&#39;t be talking about it,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that guy, too. That&#39;s crazy. That&#39;s
a crazy position. You You can&#39;t listen
to that. You&#39;re going to get the most
preposterous takes because you&#39;re
dealing with something that millions of
people are commenting on. So the idea
that you&#39;re every one of them is going
to be a rational position, that&#39;s not
real. People are silly. Like people are
weird. They have crazy takes on
everything. There&#39;s all sorts of
personal justifications and mental
illness and there&#39;s people who hate
women. There&#39;s people that, you know,
whatever. They law enforcement&#39;s always
right. You&#39;re always gonna have
ridiculous takes if you get a billion
takes on things. That&#39;s your world. No,
you shouldn&#39;t be struggling with that at
all. That&#39;s crazy. Anybody who says you
shouldn&#39;t be talking about it, but
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] of course you should be because
there&#39;s a lot to be learned. There&#39;s a
lot to be learned from, first of all,
the admirable positions that you&#39;ve
taken. The way you&#39;ve formed your life
and who you are as a human being because
of your struggle, because of this insane
experience that you had to go through at
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] 20 years old. Your brain&#39;s not
even fully formed. It&#39;s insane. Your
frontal cortex is not fully formed. And
for someone to say that you you you&#39;re
not the real victim. Well, that&#39;s crazy.
That&#39;s crazy. That&#39;s a this is a stupid
position. Well, we shouldn&#39;t be
conflicted in any way, shape, or form
about that. And I think
there&#39;s a great deal that we can learn
from your experiences. First of all,
again, learn from the way that you&#39;ve
handled it where you can sit across from
that prosecutor and this feeling of like
being kind to this person who did this
thing to you, how it made you empowered.
I really do think that&#39;s the universe
telling you you&#39;re on the right track.
You just can&#39;t listen to the peanut
gallery. You can&#39;t listen to all the
noise. There&#39;s just too much noise. And
you you have to learn how to do that on
a much lesser scale. I I see that with
friends who are famous who read comments
about them or read articles and get
infuriated. It ruins vacations because
they have to type up a response or you
know the impulse to respond is like You
don&#39;t have to. Not only do you not
should you not respond, you shouldn&#39;t
read what they&#39;re saying in the first
place. You shouldn&#39;t pay attention. Is
there ever like I I wonder if the fear
is and maybe this is my fear cuz I&#39;m
always questioning myself is like is
there I always want to like at
least hear it and like cycle the thought
through my mind so that I can test the
validity of it in my mind. Yes, there&#39;s
definitely that. Sure. But to a point,
you should probably do that yourself
without those people. That&#39;s the best
way. The best way is to have an internal
auditing system where you look at your
own life and say, did what did I do that
I could have done better? Right? And
what what what about is there anything
about what I&#39;m doing that feels icky?
Right? Is there anything about the way
I&#39;m capitalizing on this that feels icky
or feels conflicted? Is there anything
about it that I don&#39;t like? Right? But
just do that yourself. You don&#39;t you&#39;re
a smart person. You don&#39;t need all those
other opinions to where you have to
like, you know, let&#39;s take email today
from all Amanda Knox haters. Like you
don&#39;t have to do that. Fair. Yeah. And
thankfully my husband is the one who
takes the brunt of that and he shouldn&#39;t
do it either. Yeah. Let me help.
As a person who&#39;s been famous for a long
time, don&#39;t do it. Okay. Fair. There&#39;s
no value in it. There&#39;s zero value in
it. I mean, there&#39;s times where I was
forced into responding like during the
whole COVID situation when CNN was
saying I was taking veterinary medicine
and and you were like, I need to clarify
reality or not. Also, I need to say,
hey, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you. Because the world should
say [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you. You&#39;re not supposed to be
able to do that. You&#39;re not supposed to
be able to be the news and lie and then
hold yourself to this moral high ground
and say we have to stop misinformation.
What about you, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Like, what
about you? You know, and so there&#39;s
that. Like, I&#39;ve had to respond in that
way. But I mean, if I responded to
everything that everybody ever says
about me, I&#39;d have no time for my
children, for my family, for my life,
for my job. I I would have no time for
anything. Like, you can&#39;t do it. You
just you have to have an internal
auditing system where you look at
yourself and you have to be your own
worst judge. You know, anything anybody
says about me that tries to make me feel
bad, well, guess what? I&#39;m way harsher
to me than you are. And I know me, you
know, and that&#39;s you know, all the dark
thoughts and the slimy feelings. But
that&#39;s why I work really hard to be a
good person. I work really hard to be a
good person because I don&#39;t like those
feelings. I don&#39;t like the when I judge
myself and I find myself to be lacking.
I don&#39;t like it. So I institute a lot of
self-discipline and I institute a lot of
introspective thinking. Yeah. What is
your what&#39;s your auditing like what&#39;s
your self- auditing process?
Well, first of all, it&#39;s like why are
you doing what you&#39;re doing with your
life? Like what are why why do you why
do you do a podcast? Why do you do
comedy? Why do you do anything? Why do
you do what you do? I So, the best way I
approach it is I do it because I love
what I do. I&#39;m intrigued. I&#39;m curious
and I do my best. Always do my best.
Now, if I halfass something, it will
haunt me. Like if I have a bad podcast
interview, if I don&#39;t if I think I
interrupted too much or if I didn&#39;t ask
the right questions, like that&#39;ll [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
with me for the rest of the day. Like I
don&#39;t need other people to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with me.
I [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with myself. I really do. I So I
So the best response to that is do
better every time. Every time. Like sit
when you sit down, be as open as
possible. Try to like don&#39;t let all
these little weird mind [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] things
enter into your head.
Just try to be pure. Try to be genuinely
curious like what&#39;s your genuine
feelings about these things? And then
did you did you handle it well? If you
didn&#39;t, what could you have done better?
Right. Well, then work on that. Yeah.
And that&#39;s all you can do. I think one
of the things that I am I worry about
is that
people only feel safe when they&#39;re
either being self-righteous or when they
are being cynical. Yeah. And like
genuine compassion or curiosity is
looked down upon as naive and a w and a
weakness. Mhm. And but I feel like the
only way to be truly
ethical is to be exposed in that way.
Cyn cynicism and self-righteousness are
shields. They are ways of approaching
the world with with with a barrier. Yes.
And absolutely. And so I
I and I can&#39;t promise anyone that doing
things my way, which is like really
trying to like push back against those
impulses, which I recognize as being
impulses, is going to necessarily lead
to good things. Like it&#39;s led it&#39;s not
your job to promise people that. It&#39;s
not your job. It&#39;s your job is for you,
for your your soul, whoever you are.
It&#39;s to speak to what what is the right
path for you. You don&#39;t you&#39;re not you
don&#39;t have to promise these people. This
is the burden of being a public figure.
Like you&#39;re not you&#39;re not a role model
for all these people. If you are a role
model for these people because they find
you admirable, that&#39;s great. But your
responsibility is to your yourself. Your
responsibility is to your own mind and
the people that you come in contact
with. So your your responsibility is not
to like say like don&#39;t be cynical, be
kind, and oh it didn&#39;t work out for you.
Oh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up. It&#39;s me. It&#39;s on
me. No, it&#39;s on them. It&#39;s on them. It&#39;s
on you. Everyone has their own soul,
their own mind, their own path, and you
have to find out what&#39;s right for you in
doing what you&#39;re doing. You are most
certainly a role model, and you most
certainly will be a role model for
including me. I I find
myself admiring like when we had the
first podcast I thought about it for a
long time. I would think about it all
throughout the day sometimes like
randomly I would just think
about imagining myself in your position
and how would I be and I I you
know I don&#39;t know I I can&#39;t answer it
but I I admire the position that you&#39;ve
taken. I think it&#39;s incredible. I think
it&#39;s a
great I it&#39;s a great example to the
world of what&#39;s possible if someone is
thrust into a horrible position that&#39;s
totally beyond their control. But what
is in your control? What&#39;s in your
control is how you respond to it. Mhm.
And how you responded to it was
incredibly admirable. That&#39;s that&#39;s your
responsibilities to yourself and you did
a great job with it. A fantastic job.
Exemplary. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anybody
else that I could point to that&#39;s ever
been through anything even remotely
close to what you&#39;ve been through and
come out the way you have. The only
examples that maybe I could point to are
some of the people that have dealt with
through Josh where we brought people in
that were wrongly accused that went
through these horrible incarcerations
and came out on the other side. these
incredibly well- readad, brilliant,
articulate people that are so thoughtful
and so introspect and so and can and
then made that time in prison empower
It can be done and those are those are
examples but the responsibility is to
yourself. It&#39;s not to these other
people. I guess like I I think that&#39;s so
I mean thank you. Um, and I agree like
I&#39;ve met very incredible people who have
made the most of a bad situation, which
ultimately that&#39;s what it comes down to.
I guess my one push back might be that I
have come to realize that we are so
interconnected like we are all
influencing each other constantly. Yes.
And so on the one hand, yes, I&#39;m only
answerable ultimately to myself, but
when I really sit down and like sit with
it, like part of the reason why I was
able to approach my prosecutor with the
perspective that I had was realizing
that like there is a fluidity between us
and all of us where we&#39;re all
influencing each other and people in his
life have now like the influences in his
life. People I will never have
met have have had direct influences in
my life because it&#39;s been like this
fluid path like this connectedness
between me and him, me and you. Any any
person we talk to, any person we
encounter is going to then have this
ripple effect. And so on the one hand,
yes, like I&#39;m a drop, but I&#39;m also a
drop in an ocean that has a ripple
effect. And that ripple is going to
interact with your ripple and and all
these other ripples. And and so yes, I
am answerable to
myself, but I also feel like I can&#39;t
ignore the potential impact that my
ripple might have on another person. And
I&#39;ve been really rewarded in the way
that I have I&#39;ve been comm those ripples
have been communicated to me. Like I&#39;ve
had someone tell me that they didn&#39;t
kill themselves because one day they
heard me, you know, in an interview and
and like that they were going to kill
themselves and then they didn&#39;t. And
like I&#39;ve had someone tell me that. And
like I never in my wildest dreams
thought that me just deciding to like
have a conversation with someone one day
on a podcast would save a human being&#39;s
life. But like those are those like the
interconnected fluidness of all of us
that like I also can&#39;t discount. You
should and that I think about a lot.
Well, you should. I mean, you are an
example. I mean, we are all an example.
And if you&#39;re a public example or we
right now, both of us are public
examples. We&#39;re we&#39;re two human beings
that are communicating right now to
millions of people. It&#39;s kind of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
up if you really think about it.
What are we doing? I know, but we&#39;re
what we are. We&#39;re we&#39;re being real
people publicly. So you you we&#39;re
thinking publicly, you know, and um that
is very beneficial to other people that
are thinking privately because you get
to hear people think publicly and
especially a person like you that&#39;s very
exemplary and that I would love if more
people could follow that line of
thinking and your example. It&#39;s it&#39;s a
beautiful example of someone who did
nothing wrong but had wrong done to them
and came out a better person because of
it. And
that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s not just
inspirational, it&#39;s aspirational. It&#39;s
it&#39;s a it it it it provides the universe
with positive energy in a weird way, the
human universe. I mean, and and this
this thing that you said I think is very
important. this um people protect
themselves with cynicism and
with people that like constantly want to
criticize things. They&#39;re constantly
criticizing things, finding fault.
You&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re also you&#39;re
ignoring your own life. That&#39;s a part of
what&#39;s really going on. The the real
things are in inside their own life.
There must be things they&#39;re ignoring.
if they&#39;re spending that much time
focusing on external factors like that
and other people and other people&#39;s
flaws and other people&#39;s things, other
people&#39;s especially like trivial
nonsensical things like celebrity beefs.
Oh, I know. You know, you know what I
mean? It&#39;s like what are you doing with
your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] lives? Like you don&#39;t It&#39;s
like I just don&#39;t know how anyone has
the time, honestly. Like as a It&#39;s
because they&#39;re losers. And this is the
reality of like some people don&#39;t want
to hear this cuz you&#39;re a loser, you
know? And it sucks being a loser. I&#39;ve
been a loser. I&#39;ve been a loser many
times in my life. You&#39;re a loser. If
you&#39;re doing that because you are on
with your own decisions becoming a
loser, you&#39;re deciding to be a loser by
focusing this precious energy that you
have in life on [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that should mean
nothing to you. Is there like a a is
there are they thinking that they&#39;re
being effective agents in the world by
participating in it? That&#39;s the con.
That&#39;s the con, right? That&#39;s the con.
Like, yeah, by taking them down a notch.
I&#39;m Yeah, I&#39;m a part of something and
I&#39;m and I&#39;m accomplishing something.
Yeah, you&#39;re not you&#39;re not you&#39;re not.
It&#39;s cynicism. It&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s, you
know, the flag of moral virtue that
you&#39;re you&#39;re waving to show that you&#39;re
better than other people, but in doing
so, you&#39;re attacking that person, which
is inherently evil. Like you you&#39;re
you&#39;re using this justification that
you&#39;re correct to try to ruin someone&#39;s
lives or ruin someone&#39;s reputation or
ruin someone&#39;s feelings, to hurt them
that day, to reach out to them and
attack. And it&#39;s almost always based on
a feeling of personal inadequacy. almost
always based on your life is not what
you want it to be. You know, the pe
people leaving horrible comments on
someone&#39;s Instagram page or Twitter
page, there&#39;s no way
you&#39;re living the life that you want to
live. There&#39;s no way that you&#39;re in an
ideal situation of love and harmony and
success and you know you have great
friends and life is amazing but yeah
this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] fat [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know, like
there&#39;s no way. There&#39;s no way if you&#39;re
typing those things there&#39;s no way like
that. It&#39;s a it&#39;s a a human flaw and
it&#39;s accentuated by this disconnect that
comes with social media. This disconnect
of being able to send a message to
someone and have no consequence. no
consequences and no social cues not to
see the person read it and get hurt by
it, you know. You&#39;re like sending little
bombs over the fence like Yeah, we are
primed to be psychopaths in
uh our our algorithms have primed us to
be psychopaths. Um and
that worries me. But if you&#39;re but
that&#39;s like a disempowering position,
you know, like you don&#39;t have to be you
don&#39;t have to do that. Like it&#39;s no
one&#39;s compelling you to do that. I don&#39;t
do that. Why are you doing that? Like
why do it? You don&#39;t have to do it then.
This is the example that you can lead
for for other people. If you are talking
and speaking publicly, just don&#39;t do
that. It&#39;s not good for you. It&#39;s not
good for it doesn&#39;t help anybody.
Hurting someone that you don&#39;t even
know, that doesn&#39;t help you. You should
be you have I always try to this is what
I tell my friends when I talk about uh
reading comments and reading things and
engaging with social media because I
have friends where it it&#39;ll like ruin
their week, ruin their day. Like one
comment will [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] them up and they and
they&#39;ll come to me and talk to me about
it. I&#39;m like listen I want you to think
about your mind and your attention like
it&#39;s a number like it&#39;s you have energy
and like like a battery, right? you have
or bandwidth that&#39;s on a a broadband
cable, right? You have a hundred units.
If you&#39;re spending 30 units of your
precious time concentrating on someone
who&#39;s saying something that&#39;s not even
true, that&#39;s mean and horrible and it&#39;s
the worst possible, least charitable
position on you, right? You&#39;re robbing
yourself of these precious units of
attention. You have a hundred units. You
should your 100 units should be all on
loved ones and friends and things that
you love to do and life. That&#39;s what
your units should be used for. And if
some of that sneaks in and it resonates
and you go, &#34;Oh my god, they&#39;re right.&#34;
Well, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] correct it. Figure out
what you did. Don&#39;t do that anymore.
It&#39;s like it sounds so simple, but
that&#39;s it. If you if you are do
something you are doing something that
people are rightly criticizing recognize
it recognize it course correct like this
is this is where friends are supposed to
come and play your friends are supposed
to be able to tell you Amanda
you didn&#39;t have to do that like I know
the the reason why you did it but like
don&#39;t do that like this is why this is
what I felt I felt like you overreacted
you didn&#39;t have to do that now this
person&#39;s all [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up because of it
right but your friends are not going to
define you by what they consider that
are the worst thing you&#39;ve ever done.
And they&#39;re going to recognize that
you&#39;re an evolving human. And I feel
like and they love you. The whole
picture of you and it&#39;s coming like
their criticism is coming from a loving
place instead of an attacking place. And
so how do we get back to communicating
with each other, not from an adversarial
place, which automatically instigates
defensiveness and sort
of refusal to acknowledge anything,
right? to a place of like genuine
Well, this is gonna sound so cliche. You
have to act out of love. Like I I
reached out to a friend of mine
recently. They&#39;re doing a podcast and it
went completely sideways and I I reached
out to him and I I sent him a text
message. I said, &#34;Hey, man. You can&#39;t do
this. Like, this is why you&#39;re doing
that. You have to recognize that people
are listening to this. You&#39;re actually
ruining your own product by doing this.
you you and and he responded back, I
know. I realized that I felt terrible
while it was happening. I got caught up
in this
thing. I got bunched up. He&#39;s like, I
got all bunched up and I just responded,
I felt terrible. I was like, it&#39;s okay.
Just don&#39;t do it again, you know, cuz he
gets to have another chance. Yeah. But
and the reason why I said it to him is
cuz he&#39;s done it before and I&#39;m like,
stop doing this. Stop doing this. Like,
you don&#39;t have to do this. This is
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you up. And ultimately like if
you I hate to use like is conversation
an art form? I kind of think it is.
Right. If if if people are consuming it
a skill. Yeah. If people are consuming
it is an art form. So if you&#39;re being
overbearing and gross and like whatever
it is, it&#39;s like that you&#39;re ruining
this art that you&#39;re creating. And this
real art like that painting is art. This
is real art. This is a weird art. It&#39;s
like I don&#39;t even want to call it art.
It&#39;s like a dance but with words. It&#39;s a
dance. It&#39;s a dance. It is a dance. It
is a dance. Conversation is a dance. And
this is why I have such a hard time.
Like I would go on a double date with my
wife or something like that where with
people and they start talking over
everybody else and sometimes I have to
say, &#34;Well, stop.&#34; Like she&#39;s talking
like he&#39;s talking. Haven&#39;t you ever
listened to a podcast? What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are
you guys doing? It&#39;s like playing. It&#39;s
like if you were Roger Federer and
you&#39;re playing tennis with people like,
&#34;No, you can&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hit the ball like
that.&#34; Like, what are you guys doing?
You can&#39;t just do multiple balls at the
same time. Do you not listen? I know you
want to say something, but this other
person is talking right now. And you
can&#39;t just talk when you want to talk.
You have to also listen. Like listening
is a part of the dance. Don&#39;t step on
people&#39;s feet. Like, you see that foot
there? Oh, I want to put my foot there.
But the foot&#39;s already there. Don&#39;t step
on their foot. This is crazy. But but
you have to step on a couple of feet to
realize, oh, I stepped on her feet. I
can&#39;t do that. You have to accidentally
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up to realize like, okay, don&#39;t do
that again. Like back up and figure out
what you did wrong. Course correct.
Can I ask you about comedy? Sure.
Because I want to do comedy. I&#39;m doing
the way you said that. I just wanna,
guys, I wanna I&#39;m actually doing standup
on Saturday. Um, but on my on Vashan
Island, I&#39;m doing What&#39;s Vashon Island?
It&#39;s where I live. It&#39;s a little island
right outside of Seattle. That is Oh,
awesome. Okay. I know where that Okay.
Have you been to Bash? No, I&#39;ve been to
uh Bainbridge. Oh, yeah. Okay.
Bainbridge Island. Um, our island is a
little more rural than Bainbridge. Um,
it&#39;s Oh, so you&#39;re doing comedy for your
community? Yeah. That&#39;s a terrible idea.
Is it? Yes. Is it? Don&#39;t do it. No. You
want strangers. Really? I feel like you
don&#39;t want to interact with those
weirdos that you live with. They I I
feel like we have a very supportive
community. I I&#39;ve done it before and
it&#39;s been great. Do you have an opening
act or you just go out by yourself? No,
I&#39;m part of like it&#39;s like um this
Saturday I&#39;m going to be a part I&#39;m in a
lineup of people who have like seven
minute set. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, that&#39;s
safe. Seven minutes is safe. Yeah. Yeah.
You know, I&#39;m walking up there and I&#39;m
like, how many times have you done it?
Uh, this will be like the fourth or
fifth time. Um, Whitney actually was the
one who first introduced me to standup.
She like I love Whitney, by the way. Can
we just can we just gush about Whitney
for a second? And I love the fact that
we both have small kids at the same
time. And I just I just love her. And so
she was the one who first recognized
like this girl&#39;s been through some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
I bet she&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] funny. and and you
know befriended me after I got on her
podcast and then when she did the roast
of Whitney Cummings for Only Fans, I was
her like special surprise guest and I
got to do a little bit of a roast of her
and a little bit of myself, right? Like
of course the one place that I can
finally get my comedic, you know, true
self out there is on Only Fans of All
Things. And you know, I get to be, you
know, when I go this Saturday, I get to
be the ex-con mom on the on the menu.
And that&#39;s a Pornhub search for you, you
like, you know, like I get to like lean
in to the tragedy of it all, but it then
goes back to that question of do people
stick you into boxes or are you allowed
to be more than what people expect you
to be? And I&#39;ve, you know, in the past,
not from my my own community, but from
strangers, received criticism for making
jokes about my experience. And again,
coming from that place of how dare you
joke about, you know, going to prison
for a crime you didn&#39;t commit when
you&#39;re not the real victim and whatever.
Or you&#39;re or you&#39;re a true crime figure.
You&#39;re a you&#39;re a you&#39;re a person who
has been I associate you with a tragedy.
Therefore, you have to stay in tragedy
space and moving into comedic space is
not allowed. And so, I&#39;m just curious
what your thoughts are about that.
That&#39;s the same thing. You&#39;re dealing
with commenters. Like, you can&#39;t listen.
I just just want to do my thing and mind
business. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If I
listened, I would have never done
anything I&#39;ve done. If I listen to
people, I&#39;ve would have never done
anything that I&#39;ve done ever. Not one
thing. But we should. Yeah. Okay. I
would have never fought. I would never
got into martial arts. I never would
have fought. I never would have done
standup comedy. I never would have done
a podcast.
Even my own wife jokes around about it
because when my kids were really little,
there was one time where my wife wanted
to go to Disneyland and I said, &#34;I
can&#39;t. I have to do a podcast.&#34; She
goes, &#34;No, you want to do a podcast.&#34; I
go, &#34;No, I I I have to. I told the
people that I was going to do it, so I
have to do it.&#34; I committed. But back
then it was it made no money. It was
just like nonsense thing that I was
doing on the internet. like what are you
doing? And to this day, we laugh about
it like thank god you didn&#39;t listen to
But I don&#39;t listen to anybody. I listen
to me. I listen to my own mind if I want
to do like I would have never moved to
Austin. Like I moved to Austin in the
middle of this giant Spotify deal and
they were like what are you doing? Like
you like what? Like so they gave me all
this money and I&#39;m like I&#39;m going to
leave LA. They&#39;re like what? Like how
are you going to get guests? I&#39;m like
I&#39;m flying them in anyway. Like who
cares? I got I want to do what I want to
do. I&#39;m going to just do it. I have a I
have a little [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] compass. It&#39;s like
right as if also as if everyone only
lives in LA and you weren&#39;t like the
only people worth talking to are going
to be in LA. Also, I was like I would
rather be broke and not live under the
the thumb of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] government than
than stay in LA and have a successful
career. Like, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you. I&#39;ll just do
standup and travel the country and just
live in the middle of it. I&#39;m not doing
this anymore. I mean, you can&#39;t tell me
I can&#39;t work. You can&#39;t tell me I can&#39;t
go out. You can&#39;t tell me I have to put
a mask on when I&#39;m walking the dog. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
you. Like, the whole thing was just
like, I&#39;m out. I&#39;m getting out of here.
And, you know, moving to Austin was a
crazy risk, you know, like to opening up
a comedy club. Everybody&#39;s always told
me, I&#39;ve always told people, be nice to
comedy club owners because you don&#39;t
want to be one of them. Like, you want
to deal with us? want to deal with a
bunch of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] crazy people
that travel the country. Half of them
are on drugs. They&#39;re all narcissists
and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] insane people and they&#39;re
all just like just their whole day.
You&#39;re really selling being a comedian
right now. Yeah. Well, just being
honest. They just half their mind most
of the day is trying to figure out
things that are [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up enough to talk
about on stage. Like, and how do how do
I phrase this? How do I structure it?
What&#39;s a way to get into people&#39;s heads
with this idea? How do I how do I make
it really funny? Like what what&#39;s the
best way to do it? And like that&#39;s a
crazy way to live. Like you don&#39;t want
those people to be your primary source
of income because like with a comedy
club owner, all you have is what the
artists create. That&#39;s all you&#39;re
selling. Otherwise, you just have a box.
You have a box of the microphone and
you&#39;re selling drinks. All you have is
other people&#39;s creation. And those
people, half of them are [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] insane.
Like, you don&#39;t want to be one of those.
But then I came out here and I was like,
&#34;God damn it, I have to be one of those
No regrets. No. No. It worked out great.
I mean, I went to your show last night.
It was super fun. Thank you. Yeah. Thank
you. Great. Glad you had a good time.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have to just do
what you think you want to do and then
just do the best version of it you can.
But to listen to people say you
shouldn&#39;t be making jokes because you&#39;re
a tragic figure. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
you. Who says who says you? Let me look
at your life, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Let me let me go
through your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] pathetic mind and
find out what weird justifications
you&#39;re making for the way you think and
behave. Like you&#39;re not in any position
to be giving out advice. And most of
those people are not in any position to
give out to be giving out advice. Yeah.
And I do worry about people&#39;s lack of
imagination. It&#39;s like I don&#39;t know.
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve had enough taken away from me
that I am not going to be limited by a
lack of imagination. Absolutely. So, and
it&#39;s also people don&#39;t want you to
You know, that sucks. Yeah. Why? Yeah.
Because because they&#39;re not succeeding.
It&#39;s all it is. People that are
succeeding for the most part want you to
succeed up until you get to their level
and you&#39;re like, &#34;Hey, hey, you&#39;re
you&#39;re buttoning up on my success.&#34; Is
there a limited amount of success in the
world? No. Why then? Well, because
they&#39;re fools. And it&#39;s famine thinking.
It&#39;s a famine mentality. And you could
either think in terms of abundance or
famine, you know. But it&#39;s a real
problem with uh comedians. Comedians
that criticize other comedians. Kind of
crazy that they&#39;re only criticizing the
ones that are way more successful than
them. Seems odd. Convenient. Seems
weird. But they don&#39;t think about it
that way. They just look at this other
person that&#39;s getting a lot of attention
and they feel bad. So they think that
should be them and instead of like using
it as inspiration like, &#34;Wow, look at
her. She&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] selling out arenas.
This is crazy. What is she doing that
I&#39;m not doing? What can I learn from
her? What can I learn from that?&#34;
Instead, they&#39;re like, &#34;Fuck her and
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] this and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that.&#34; And what
you&#39;re doing is stealing bandwidth from
yourself. that 100 units, you&#39;re now
spending 30 units criticizing other
people who aren&#39;t even thinking about
Haha. Haha. Doing it to
yourself. And it ruins. And not only
that, but when you&#39;re doing it publicly,
everybody knows what you&#39;re doing.
Anybody who&#39;s really worth considering,
who&#39;s an intelligent, objective person
knows exactly what your motivation is.
They know why you&#39;re doing it.
the least charitable takes on things and
the worst possible light that you&#39;re
shining on things and the the the worst
descriptions of people like you know
what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re just trying to
make up for the fact that you&#39;ve fallen
You don&#39;t like how your path has gone
and you&#39;re you know you see someone all
of a sudden she&#39;s telling she&#39;s doing
comedy now. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that. you know, you
shouldn&#39;t be doing cuz she shouldn&#39;t be
doing comedy. These hot takes that
people have, you know, while they&#39;re on
anti-depressants and their whole [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
world&#39;s in a tizzy. Like, shut up. You
don&#39;t have to listen. But it&#39;s okay that
they talk. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s like part of
the learning experience of human
culture. Like, civilization has to have
a bunch of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] people talking about
stuff and a bunch of it noise. And it&#39;s
up to you to figure out what&#39;s noise.
And like well then you see someone who&#39;s
not noise and who&#39;s someone who&#39;s living
an exemplary life and go okay that&#39;s not
noise okay what&#39;s in that what&#39;s in that
like oh she met with a prosecutor wow
and she like she felt empowered you know
people are going to listen to what you
just said about that and just like just
like when they&#39;re alone like throughout
the day when they&#39;re driving their car
when they&#39;re sitting on the train they
got to think about that. I mean I&#39;m
still thinking about that. I&#39;m I&#39;m still
like trying to figure it out. And I
think that&#39;s good. I think Yeah. We&#39;re
all, like you said, we&#39;re all
interconnected. We&#39;re all learning
together, you know, and the only thing
you could do is do your best. Do your
best. Do your best. Is that the advice?
Do your best. Yes. Is that is that
advice, Daddy? With everything. With
everything. With everything. Do your
best. Be a nice person and do your best.
Yeah. It&#39;s all you can do. Done and
done. Yeah. we have solved. It seems so
simple, but you know those demons will
they never sleep. They&#39;ll wake up in the
morning tapping you on the head. The
thing that again the thing that haunts
me is when people think they&#39;re doing
their best and they&#39;re not. That&#39;s what
haunts me like and that happens that
that is happening constantly is people
convincing themselves that they&#39;re doing
their best and they&#39;re not.
But then how do you get out of that
cycle of convincing yourself? because
that&#39;s where the the issue of cognitive
bias comes in and like reaffirming your
your sense of self to yourself and your
identity like I&#39;m a good guy. I can&#39;t,
you know, I can&#39;t do wrong or like uh,
you know, I&#39;m I&#39;m a good friend, I can&#39;t
be a bad like there there are ways that
we define ourselves that makes it
impossible for ourselves to to see
ourselves clearly. And that freaks me
out. Like I&#39;m always afraid of that.
Five grams in silent darkness.
Prescribe.
And you might have to do it more than
once. You might have to do a lot of
cleaning. Yeah. Clean your closet. clean
your closet, okay? Throw out all the
stupid [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] But it&#39;s hard for people
because, you know, you&#39;re on this path
of momentum. Often times people are
ahead of their skis. You know, they&#39;re
on this path of and they don&#39;t know how
to stop the train that&#39;s out of the
station. Yeah. But in a much lesser
extent because it&#39;s more in their
control, you know, in your situation,
it&#39;s beyond your control. And a lot of
people, they&#39;re the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] they&#39;re at
they&#39;re the engineer, you know, they&#39;re
the ones who&#39;s in the skis. They&#39;re the
ones who are deciding to go straight
downhill, you know. It&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s
hard. It&#39;s hard. And then you have all
these things once you&#39;ve sort of created
a life and you have all these pieces in
motion and then you realize like, oh my
god, this is like kind of beyond my
control and I don&#39;t like where it&#39;s
going, but everything&#39;s still moving. It
takes a lot to pull that back and you
kind of have to slow it down in stages,
you know? you have to like throw things
off the side of the car like what&#39;s go
got to get rid of this got to get rid of
that some you&#39;re going to have to cut
people out of your life sometimes
sometimes it&#39;s people sometimes certain
people they&#39;re not going to learn and I
think you know the universe provides
them as an example of how not to live
but also as a puzzle that you need to
solve like you need to sol if this
person is continually bringing negative
things into your life and continually
tripping you up and sabotaging you. You
have to at a certain point in time
separate yourself. You have to, you
know, you got to ghost
people. As horrible as that seems, like
you can&#39;t because you don&#39;t have enough
time. Yeah. There&#39;s not enough time in
the world. Your time is very precious.
And if people don&#39;t want to help
themselves, you can&#39;t help them. True.
That&#39;s very true. I&#39;ve definitely found
myself in the position of not being
helpable. Um, there&#39;s a story I tell in
in the book about trusting the wrong
person and wanting to believe that they
were someone like me, someone who could
understand me, and then I realized they
were not. That&#39;s horrible when you let
someone in and you realize you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
up. I&#39;ve had that happen multiple times.
Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of conart artists
out there. There&#39;s a lot of sociopaths.
There&#39;s a lot of slippery people that
they&#39;re chameleons. They&#39;re like little
cuttlefish. they kind of adapt to their
environment and slip into your world.
It&#39;s dangerous. You know, there&#39;s a lot
of people that that they look at it
like like it&#39;s a like a game, like how
do I get close to this person? How do I
benefit from this relationship? How do I
make these connections? And in the
business world, you&#39;re actually taught
to do that, right? which is you&#39;re
really crazy, which is what like no
wonder, right? It&#39;s a good word in that
way. You have to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know, and
you and the wife have to go out and like
pretend that like I know he&#39;s an
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] We&#39;re going to sit with him
because it&#39;s really important for my
promotion. And then, you know, that&#39;s no
wonder why CEOs become sociopaths. Like,
of course, like that&#39;s part of has a
good book about that. Have you read the
psychopath test? No, I haven&#39;t. I read
the publicly shamed book though. Yeah,
that&#39;s a good one, too. It&#39;s great.
Yeah. He&#39;s so funny. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s um
I mean it&#39;s a Being a human is weird.
There&#39;s no guide book, you know. There&#39;s
You have the most
complex interactive machine that is
constantly adapting and changing and
it&#39;s completely variable. It&#39;s
completely variable based on your
environment. Like not just your
environment in terms of the human
beings, but even the like weather. Like
if you live in Seattle, right? You&#39;re on
a very different wavelength than when
you&#39;re in Austin. It&#39;s true. I come here
and I feel like I&#39;m in a bath all the
time. Just in a bath. What do you mean?
It&#39;s so hot and like But and and that
like impacts me in a way where I just
feel sort of dreamy like I&#39;m in a bath
all the time instead of That&#39;s
interesting. I&#39;ve never heard it put
that way. In a bath. That&#39;s funny.
That&#39;s funny. I I Yeah, I don&#39;t think
about that way. I wanted to ask how you
slow down though, right? You&#39;re talking
about slowing down and like taking
stock. Uhhuh. And the way I do it is by
meditating, but I have found that a lot
of people are resistant to the idea of
meditating because they have certain
ideas about what meditating is. and like
it&#39;s shutting off your thoughts and it&#39;s
like well you know eventually you might
be able to do that but ultimately it&#39;s
just sitting down and noticing your
thoughts that arise. Um but I like to
say that anyone who can masturbate can
meditate and ultimately like actually
people that can meditate maybe not be
able to masturbate because they don&#39;t
have any arms. You can still meditate.
Exactly. and you get ultimately to a
similar place of like just single-minded
and bliss. So go for it. Don&#39;t hold
back. Yeah. Um and the funny things that
occur to your brain when you are
meditating like I have Okay. Can I can I
tell you something that&#39;s kind of like
off color? Sure. Well, maybe you know
this, like since becoming a mom, like my
really. Oh, yeah. Just because I&#39;m
constantly being like touched that like
the last thing I need is for my husband
to climb on me like a jungle gem. Like
it&#39;s just it&#39;s just not what&#39;s on the
menu for me. Also, you&#39;re probably tired
all the time. I&#39;m so tired and like I&#39;m
just like my body is different. The
chemistry is still working itself out.
Uhhuh. The one thing that reliably makes
me horny is meditating. Interesting.
Isn&#39;t that wild? Huh? And you know, we
have this like term in meditation like
monkey mind, right? Like the idea being
that like when you sit down, you really
notice that your mind is going all over
the place and is just like reacting like
a monkey. But also another thing that
monkeys are famous for is just
masturbating voraciously. And I feel
like that&#39;s also what&#39;s happening in my
mind. Like I sit down and notice like
how perverted my mind is when I&#39;m
actually just sitting there meditating
in a nice group of people on a Sunday
morning. That&#39;s funny. So Oh, group
meditation. Oh yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s not just
like when I&#39;m home alone like in my
intimate space. Like I&#39;m like I feel
Yeah. This is I hope no one at my zeno
this conversation. Maybe they&#39;re going
to come up to you the next time you do
like me too. Yes. But then you don&#39;t
want to know cuz then you&#39;re going to be
meditating like this freak is thinking
about sex too. Well, I mean and you&#39;re
sitting there and you&#39;re thinking like
what else are the uses of these floor
cushions? Like you&#39;re just like going
like all of the things in your brain and
then you&#39;re thinking am I the only one?
Am interesting. Yeah. So I don&#39;t know.
There&#39;s something again one of those
like weird un um unintended consequences
of just trying to like sit back and take
stock is like rediscovering parts of
yourself that are have been sort of
diminished or made dormant because of
the the stress of existence. So another
reason why they should advertise that. I
don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t advertise that
on meditation apps. Like, is this just
It would attract the wrong people. Like,
I&#39;m trying to get
perverted. I&#39;m trying to find my inner
pervert. Exactly.
Yeah. I don&#39;t know. Um, I don&#39;t
necessarily meditate that way, but I do
incorporate a lot of voluntary
adversity.
Um, a lot of it is working out. Um, you
got a lot of Buddhas around you for
someone who doesn&#39;t meditate. I know.
Weird, right? Let&#39;s go with that. My
friend Duncan has some very bizarre
theories about that. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m
very uh drawn to that. Um
uh I do though, it&#39;s just I do it while
I&#39;m doing other things. I&#39;ve always said
that martial arts is a form of moving
meditation because it&#39;s so singular in
its focus that it requires all of your
thoughts and it cleanses your mind.
There&#39;s a bunch of things that I do, a
bunch of things that I do that do that.
Archery, archery does that, oddly
enough. Archer in the art of archery.
There&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s that book.
Yes. There&#39;s something about because
Have you ever done archery? I have done
it because my um my brother-in-law is a
Renfair guy. He&#39;s a Renfair performer.
Yeah. So cool. I&#39;m going to Can I call
out Seattle Nights by the way? He is the
director of the Seattle Knights. And
yes, he jousts. He like talks in I know.
It&#39;s so cool. It&#39;s so cool. I love it.
And I always I&#39;m gonna go to their show
on Woodby Island this month anyway.
That&#39;s funny. Yeah, they&#39;re awesome. But
yes, so yeah. Uh what were we saying?
Archery. Archery. Yes. So I&#39;ve done it
like in his backyard because he has all
of the medieval weaponry and
Yeah. I don&#39;t use the medieval ones. I
use modern ones. But the the the thing
about it is that it it&#39;s very difficult
to do accurately, especially at
distance. Right. So when I practice, I
practice it. Most of the time I practice
in at about 85 yards and the amount of
movement like so if you&#39;re at full draw,
so you draw the bow back, right? If
you&#39;re at full draw, if if you look at
my arm, if my arm does this, I miss by
six inches. Wait, what did you just do?
This this this ah I&#39;m missing by six
inches at 85 yards. a slight I mean a
millimeter of movement is 4 in off
target. So you&#39;re saying that Legolos is
a badass is what I&#39;m hearing. Who?
Legalis from Lord of the Rings.
Oh yeah, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not. That&#39;s not a
real person. I&#39;m applying it to human
beings. Oh, okay. Fine. That there&#39;s
this repeatable technique that you have
to do. It involves breathing and focus
concentration and uh there&#39;s actually a
whole process that I go through. There&#39;s
this guy named Joel Turner who was a uh
he was a SWAT instructor and a lead guy
in hostage situations where you know
someone would like have a a child
hostage. you had to shoot the guy who
was like holding a knife to a child. And
he&#39;s he&#39;s had situations like that where
you have to be completely focused on the
task. And so he developed this process
of talking yourself through the shot
with this you have these words that you
say and you repeat in your mind while
you&#39;re going through all of these
various techniques. So when you&#39;re
drawing a bow back, you draw back. You
have to anchor. So you put this string
in a very particular part of your mouth.
Every time my knuckle, this finger goes
underneath my jaw in the exact same
spot. Every time my elbow goes up in the
exact same spot, and then it&#39;s staying
still and concentrating on the target
and pulling through. and you can&#39;t think
about anything else. It&#39;s so
overwhelming
that you have to focus if you want to be
accurate, you have to focus only on
that. And in doing so, the world just
goes away. The world goes away because
it requires so much of you. Martial arts
is the same thing. Like if you&#39;re doing
jiu-jitsu and you and this person are
trying to solve each other&#39;s puzzle and
you&#39;re trying you&#39;re you&#39;re essentially
trying to kill each other but in a
friendly way like you&#39;re friends but
because you can tap out you don&#39;t hurt
each other but you&#39;re it you can&#39;t be
thinking about your bills. You can&#39;t be
thinking about an argument you got in
this. Why did my dog [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on the rug?
You can&#39;t be thinking about those
things. You have to be completely
focused on what you&#39;re doing. And in
that way, like jiu-jitsu people are some
of the calmst, most chilled out people
you will ever meet in your life. First
of all, because they get all of their
aggression out. Like all the
unnecessary aggression that people carry
around with them, all this angst and
100%, which is part of being a human
being because we&#39;re designed to run away
from predators. We&#39;re designed to hunt
and gather and look out for invading
tribes. is like this is the genetic
sequence that evolved for hundreds of
thousands of years that we still have.
It&#39;s still a part of us. These human
reward systems that are all in place,
you have to honor those. And one of the
ways you have to honor those is rigorous
exercise. Whatever you like to do. You
can play squash. You could play tennis.
You can run. You could do yoga. You
could lift weights. You could do
jiu-jitsu. But you have to do something.
if you don&#39;t do something, you&#39;re going
to always be the most anxietyridden
people I know are also sedentary. I
don&#39;t think that&#39;s a coincidence. And I
also always feel like whenever I&#39;m
feeling really shitty psychologically, I
need to go for a run. Yes. Um, do you
find So, here&#39;s my question.
Given that that is your like meditative
practice, do you find that in the moment
that the you release the bow and that
like that becoming one and that flow
state that you have entered into in
order to perfectly align yourself with
the bow and the arrow. Does that moment
of release
ever result in some kind of unconscious
processing coming into your
consciousness? So like some kind of a
new awareness of something that you&#39;ve
been trying to figure out and it like is
a catalyst for you figuring out what you
need like that feeling of like being in
sync with the universe and knowing what
you need to do. Do you ever find
yourself like in the moment that you are
like immediately exiting that flow
state? Do you real do you feel more
clarity about your life or what you need
to do or or that thing that you weren&#39;t
thinking about like your to-do list or
your bills or that argument that you&#39;ve
had with somebody that you care about?
Like does anything come into focus or do
you find you you walk away from an
encounter in jiu-jitsu like knowing not
just feeling better emotionally but like
knowing what you need to do next? I
think more so with jiu-jitsu. Um, with
archery it&#39;s
just, you know, because it&#39;s so hard to
do at the and it&#39;s such a singular
thing. You&#39;re just doing this one thing
over and over and over again. Like I&#39;ll
do it like a hundred times in a day. The
the the thing is like, okay, what did I
do right? What did I do wrong? Like what
why why did that shot go bad? Like what?
Minute adjustments. Yeah, just minute
adjustments. And again, it&#39;s just a
clarity. I&#39;m sorry about my throat,
people. Yeah, no worries. It&#39;s um it&#39;s
just a clarity of uh analysis of
technique and of execution. So it&#39;s it&#39;s
so overwhelming. It&#39;s so singular in in
it in in the focus that you don&#39;t really
think about anything else. So there&#39;s no
room for like oh now I know what I did
wrong in my life. Like yeah I guess I
one of the benefits that I get from
meditation is feeling like when I come
out of meditation I feel like I I have a
clarity of purpose that I might not have
had because I was I had monkey mind and
I was busy I was distracted and I was
using my bandwidth was so much and so
you just tune down what your bandwidth
is like paying attention to and then you
re-enter the world with a renewed sense
of clarity.
and you&#39;re not as distracted. You&#39;re not
on that treadmill of thought. Yeah. I
think that comes to me at least that
comes much more through rigorous
exercise. That makes sense. Yeah. That&#39;s
the at the end of a really hard workout
and sauna and stretching. Stretching is
always great, too. That&#39;s a good time
for reflection after it&#39;s over and it&#39;s
like this wind down, cool down. And then
I&#39;m just I always feel so much nicer.
That&#39;s the one thing I really like about
it. Like after I work out, I feel so
much nicer. Like I want to be I&#39;m a good
person now. I want I know. I just want
to be nice to people. I want to I want
to smile and say hi to everybody. Like
all the weirdness of being a man, it
just goes away. You know, the weirdness
of being a man. I do think that I am I
do not envy you being a man. Oh my god,
it&#39;s the best. I don&#39;t envy you being a
woman. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Oh, no. I
much prefer being a woman. Of course
you&#39;re a woman.
I mean, testosterone is a hell of a
drug, my friend. Like, what the hell is
that? Testosterone? I don&#39;t want to deal
with that. It&#39;s interesting. But you
have some. You have more testosterone
than you have estrogen. What? Yeah.
Yeah. Women have more testosterone than
they have estrogen. But I&#39;ve never felt
the impulse to punch a wall, you know?
Me neither. That&#39;s stupid. Okay. Well,
punch walls. Well, you have an outlet
for your punching energy, but like the I
don&#39;t I mean, what I mean is like that
innate elevate like an elevated level of
aggression that just is not like
accessible to me as as a as a woman. I
is that wrong? Am I like inaccurate in
this? I just feel like I don&#39;t know what
I would do if I wanted to just like jerk
off all the time. Like I just don&#39;t
understand what that is
like. And that seems over like
that doesn&#39;t seem fun to deal with.
Uh yeah. Well, you don&#39;t really want to
jerk off all the time unless you&#39;re a
sex addict, you know, then you probably
got other deal issues you&#39;re dealing
with. Um but the aggression
thing, it&#39;s not just like aggression for
no reason. Like you only have aggression
for a reason. Like I I never have
aggression for like I&#39;m never like
walking around like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] mad at
everything. There&#39;s never never it&#39;s
never the case. And um but I also I work
out a lot so I get it out. I get it out
of my system. It&#39;s just a thing like you
just have to maintain. You have you just
have to maintain your life. You have to
maintain your body. You have to
recognize you have biological needs.
And as a man I think one of those needs
is you have to exercise to to just calm
yourself to relieve anxiety. And again,
that&#39;s that term that is used often, but
I think it&#39;s the right term, voluntary
adversity. You show up at class, you
work out really hard. You show up at the
gym, you work out really hard, and then
when it&#39;s over, you&#39;re like, you feel
better. You feel good. Like you&#39;re
nicer. Like strong, powerful people can
be the nicest people because they don&#39;t
have to be nice. They&#39;re being nice cuz
they want to be nice. M there&#39;s a lot of
weak, feeble men that pretend that
they&#39;re nice, but really what they are
is just vulnerable. They&#39;re they have to
be nice cuz they don&#39;t have any choice.
Like if you you and if they were in a
position of not having to then they
would they would drop the nice act. And
that&#39;s what happens. They&#39;re some of the
creepiest [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] people when they have
power is like really weak men. They&#39;re
some of the scariest people and they&#39;re
the scariest people as politicians.
They&#39;re just really weak men that all of
a sudden have power. I&#39;m going to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] show you. Like having real power
is to be kind when you don&#39;t have to be
kind. You know what I love about being a
woman though? What that I do think is a
genuine thing and a genuine difference
is it&#39;s easier for me to be nurturing.
um in the sense that like no one would
bat an eye if I saw a kid who was like I
couldn&#39;t figure out where their mom was
and I were to approach them and say come
here honey let me help you as a man like
do you second like I know that like my
husband has told me this that like he
secondguesses like hanging out at you
know with the kids at the at the park
because someone might think that he&#39;s a
pedophile. Oh that&#39;s crazy. Hanging out
with his kids. Yeah, cuz like if you&#39;re
just like a a guy sitting on a bench and
your kids are playing, like how does
anyone know that you aren&#39;t just a guy?
I think he&#39;s really overthinking things.
Like, of course, you&#39;re a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] dad at
the park. That&#39;s crazy. You see other
dads at the park. You say hi. Like, it&#39;s
like you&#39;re not a pedophile. Those are
my kids. Which How old&#39;s your kid? Like,
it&#39;s normal. I&#39;ve taken my kids to parks
a thousand times. You&#39;ve never felt in
some way that your masculinity inhibited
your ability like your your instinct to
be like nurturing and affectionate?
No. No. I think that&#39;s a weakness. Like
if you can&#39;t be nurturing and
affectionate because you think you&#39;re
masculine, that&#39;s crazy. That&#39;s just
weak. That&#39;s that&#39;s nuts. That&#39;s like a
distortion of what strength means. Like
that&#39;s not that&#39;s not strong. That&#39;s
weak. Like, why can&#39;t you be nice? Like,
why can&#39;t you be like the idea that if
you&#39;re nice and you&#39;re affectionate,
you&#39;re kind that you&#39;re weak. That&#39;s
crazy. That&#39;s crazy. Especially if you
have options. Like, if you if you don&#39;t
have to be nice and you&#39;re nice, like
that&#39;s real niceness. Like, it&#39;s pure.
Like, you don&#39;t have to be you don&#39;t
have to be a nice person, but you&#39;re
nice because it&#39;s a good thing to do.
Like, that it&#39;s the right way to do it.
Okay. Okay. So, what&#39;s so great about
being a guy?
Everything. It&#39;s awesome. We [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
build everything. We run the world. It&#39;s
I don&#39;t know. I I I am a guy. I mean, I
would And yet like all comes down to
trying to like get the attention of some
lady. That is all. No, I already have
the attention of a lady. I&#39;m good. I&#39;m
still love being a guy. It&#39;s only, you
know, it&#39;s not like that&#39;s the primary
motivation. No. What is the primary
motivation? Fun. Fun. Fun. Yeah, life is
fun. Life should be fun. Sounds pretty
great. It should be fun if you pursue it
correctly. There&#39;s a lot of stuff to do.
A lot of stuff to do. That&#39;s
interesting. That&#39;s why when I hear
people say, &#34;I&#39;m bored.&#34; Like, I don&#39;t
even understand you. I don&#39;t even get
it. How the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you be bored? I
wish I had 50 lives to live
simultaneously. I would do a bunch of
different things. I would have a bunch
of different jobs. I was always there
like so many different things that I&#39;d
love to do. Aren&#39;t people sometimes
beholden to doing things that they don&#39;t
want to do just because they have to
make bills or they have to But that&#39;s
all choices that you make too. And
unfortunately these choices sort of they
cascade, you know, you could find
yourself motivated by the wrong things
and doing things for the wrong reasons
like doing things just for money and
just for this or just for that. And I&#39;ve
done that before. I I know it. But then
you have to realize like what you&#39;re
doing and not and and stay focused on
the prize. Yeah. Take the steps to not
want to do that anymore, you know.
But, you know, it&#39;s like
you people there&#39;s people listening to
this right now like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s easy
for you to say because I have to do this
and I have to do that.&#34; That&#39;s true. But
you can do things to better your life
with your free time. Go open your phone
right now and look at your screen
time. Okay. Now, I understand the screen
time is 10 minutes here, 20 minutes
there, 5 minutes here, 5 minutes there.
But that screen time, it&#39;s probably
about five hours, which is crazy. That&#39;s
five hours you could have been improving
your life. That&#39;s five hours you could
have been doing something different.
That&#39;s five hours you could have went to
the gym. That&#39;s five hours you could
have eaten better. You could have taken
steps to have better food in your house.
That you could have taken steps to
pursue a career or move in the direction
of pursuing something that&#39;s different
than what you&#39;re doing that you would
actually find satisfying and and
fulfilling. You just have to decide what
are you doing with your time? And you
know, and this goes back to people
commenting and and bitching at people
online. Well, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.
If if if you&#39;re distracting yourself by
doing a bunch of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that&#39;s just
worthless and it is worthless and easy
maybe and easy and very easy. Yeah. It&#39;s
cuz you need discipline. You need to
figure out what do what do you really
want to do with your life and what makes
you feel better. Do you feel like you
are innately disciplined?
No. H no. I&#39;ve learned that. Okay. I&#39;ve
developed that. Yeah. That&#39;s not No
one&#39;s innately disciplined. No, I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s real. I think we look at
people that are disciplined like, &#34;Oh,
it must be easy for them. You&#39;re just
born with that gene.&#34; No, that&#39;s not
real. No, you recognize the value of
discipline and the rewards. You reap the
rewards and then you like it and so you
keep doing it. You keep pursuing it. H
I&#39;m just curious about like brain
chemistry because when I think about you
know you&#39;ve been very complimentary uh
towards me in this conversation but a
part of me is wondering am I just lucky
that I have the kind of internal
chemistry that I have that makes me
value the things that I value and you
know I&#39;m just doing what I feel
compelled to do and I&#39;m curious when
people feel compelled to do otherwise
and I don&#39;t know where to place
um responsibility for that. Do you know
what I mean? Well, you you wouldn&#39;t know
unless you are them. You could look to
your own life to times where you
haven&#39;t lived in an exemplary way or or
done things where you&#39;re helping
yourself and done things in fact that
are actually sabotaging your life. Mhm.
And you can correct them yourself, but
it&#39;s very hard. I mean, you would have
to be a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] counselor that would
have ultimate truth access to a person&#39;s
thought processes to really find out why
they&#39;re doing things differently, why
why they&#39;re not living in a way. The
only thing you could do is live by
example. You know, there&#39;s a um a term
for a taekwondo instructor. It&#39;s called
a sabom nim, and it&#39;s one who lives by
example. And that&#39;s what you have to do.
You have to you have to live by example
like live like someone&#39;s watching. Yes.
Li this is what I tell people and I&#39;ve
I&#39;ve said this for years. You want to
have a successful life. If you want to
live your life like there&#39;s a
documentary crew around you filming your
everyday life and that you want people
to be impressed with you. Do it when no
one&#39;s watching. Do it when no one&#39;s
watching. I think about that when I work
out. I think I think about that. Yeah.
If people were judging me and they were
watching me right now and they would
what what what would you think?
Yeah. I and I now I&#39;m wondering if like
that&#39;s one of those weird silver linings
to this whole experience is that my life
became very very public very early and
so I literally do have to walk around
living my life as if there is
potentially a documentary crew following
me around. Yeah, I think that is I think
that&#39;s real. I think that&#39;s the gift
that I have gotten by being famous.
That I have to live publicly.
And if I didn&#39;t, like if I was just some
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tyrant that no one knew, you
know, and I just had all this wealth and
power and no one knew me and I could
just get away with being an [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
right? Yeah. I think the the most
wealthy and the most powerful do not
want fame because with fame comes
accountability. Yeah. But that&#39;s good.
That&#39;s good.
Even the haters are good, you know. And
then the people that defend the the
defend you against the haters, that&#39;s
good, too. It&#39;s all good. So, everyone&#39;s
just working this out together publicly,
you know, and they&#39;re doing it through
different vessels and sometimes they do
it through other people. They&#39;re doing
it through me and they&#39;re doing it
through you. Would you wish fame on
anyone? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
You can&#39;t handle it. Yeah. No. But you
can handle it. I mean, but most people
can&#39;t handle it. It breaks people.
That&#39;s why people can&#39;t have it when
they&#39;re young. The worst thing you do to
a child is make them famous. The worst
thing. I mean, look at there&#39;s countless
examples. I&#39;ve I&#39;ve talked to so many of
them on the podcast. They&#39;re all broken.
Yeah. Like who who have you talked to?
I&#39;m curious. Kulkin, Miley Cyrus. He&#39;s
doing much better now, isn&#39;t he? He&#39;s
great. Yeah, he&#39;s great. I mean, he&#39;s as
great as you can be to be super famous
when you&#39;re six. Oh god, I&#39;m friends
with Ricky Schroeder. Um, you know, uh,
I&#39;ve had a bunch of them on, a bunch of
people on that were famous when they&#39;re
young and they all are missing
something. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re making
cement and you don&#39;t add enough water.
There&#39;s like something that happens when
you have fame and agilation during your
de developmental stages as a child when
you&#39;re supposed to be like figuring out
how do I get people to like me like what
what is it about, you know? And there is
that is that is that developmental stage
when like your your brain chemistry is
being configured for the rest of your
life like that that is scary. You want
to you want to put that brain chemistry
uh coagulation into the in the right
configuration in the right set of
circumstances or else you&#39;re going to be
having a complex for the rest of your
life that you&#39;re going to be grappling
with because I don&#39;t know if you can
undo the stuff that you that gets
ingrained in your brain chemistry when
you&#39;re a kid. Like I don&#39;t know [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I
don&#39;t know anything I don&#39;t know [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
all about brains but like it seems to me
that like
especially developmentally when your
brain hasn&#39;t configured yet that&#39;s when
you get hardwired to have complexes the
rest of your life that you&#39;re going to
be dealing with 100%. And if your brain
formulated with extreme agilation and
love for no [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] reason just because
you&#39;re a cute kid, but you&#39;re a cute kid
in front of the whole world in Home
Alone. That&#39;s nuts. That&#39;s nuts. Yeah. I
mean, he&#39;s a very thoughtful person and
he&#39;s come through it. I mean, I really
enjoyed talking to him. He&#39;s a really
nice guy. Does he regret being in the
Home Alone movies? Boy, that&#39;s a good
question. I&#39;d have to ask him. I don&#39;t
know. I mean, I don&#39;t know, you know,
cuz I mean, you know, you can look back.
I don&#39;t even know how much of a choice
that was for him. How many how much can
you choose anything when you&#39;re six? How
could you choose? But like, so in a way,
it was a thing that happened to him that
he didn&#39;t really have control over,
right? And does he look back on that and
go, would I would I give up that like if
I could get that life back, would I have
a different life? I&#39;m curious what he
would say. Well, he most certainly would
have a different life. Yeah. Yeah. Um
would it be better? I don&#39;t know. You
know, but I don&#39;t know anybody that&#39;s
again gone through that
that&#39;s air quotes whole at the end of
it, you know. I just think
that there&#39;s also this weird thing where
you become the provider for the family
which is very strange child. Yeah. And
then you have this parasitic
relationship that your parents have to
you which is I have friends that were
famous as as young people and they have
these very [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up complicated
relationships with their parents. One of
my friends where they found out their
parents stole from them millions of
Yeah. And then you have to grapple with
that as you&#39;re an
adult. These monsters, you know, they
they used you as an ATM machine and they
stopped working and they became your
quote unquote manager. Really just
pushing you out there to try to siphon
money off of you. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] a. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] a.
Yeah. Yeah. But I got fame in a a slow
drip. I got slow doses like like snake
venom. You get a little bit of snake
venom. If you get one big bite from a
cobra, you&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] You know, that&#39;s
what I got. Yeah. So,
well, you&#39;re strong. So, here I am. But
you&#39;re strong. You came through it on
the other side. A very durable person,
you know, and I think there&#39;s, you know,
it&#39;s a trial by fire and you went
through it. I mean, you know, that&#39;s
what, you know, that&#39;s what they do in
boot camp.
you know, you you go through something
very difficult to be strong at the end.
And you don&#39;t become strong, just wake
up one day, I&#39;m strong. No, you have to
go through some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know, and that
going through some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] when you&#39;re a
kid as becoming famous is different than
going through like hardship as a child.
I know a lot of children that went
through hardship. Like all my friends
that are interesting all had horrible
childhoods. All of them. All my most
fascinating friends. I&#39;m so grateful
that I did not have a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up
childhood. Well, that&#39;s probably what
prepared you or helped you. Indeed. I
feel like if I had gone through this
experience after having a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up
childhood, I would be a psychopath
today, right? So, thank God I had a good
childhood. Yes.
Yeah. I didn&#39;t have a bad childhood. I
had a complex childhood, but it wasn&#39;t
bad. You know, my mother and my
stepfather are very nice people. there.
It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up. It
was moved around a lot. Didn&#39;t have a
lot of friends, got bullied, a lot of
different things. Okay. But wasn&#39;t the
worst, you know? Nothing horrible
happened to me, you know. So, it&#39;s
like the the
trials can&#39;t be too hard. They can&#39;t
break you. They have to be just enough
so that you gain some strength and you
rebuild. And if they do break you, then
it&#39;s a very difficult task of
rebuilding. And people that have gone
through horrible childhood trauma,
particularly abuse and sexual abuse,
that they have the most
difficult hurdles to overcome. I agree.
I think in in large part because how do
you trust like I think rebuilding your
life relies upon like upon rebuilding
yourself in the context of other human
beings and how do you do that when you
can&#39;t trust anyone? It&#39;s true. But I do
know some people that have gone through
childhood sexual trauma that are also
incredibly fascinating people because
they they they&#39;ve figured out a way to
acquire strength through it all. But
what about trust? And that&#39;s the other
thing I was going to say. And then
they&#39;ve also figured out a way to well
they&#39;re also very skeptical of people
and rightly so. But that&#39;s a good thing
because a lot of people don&#39;t have your
intentions in mind. Especially if you&#39;re
a woman, right? If you&#39;re a woman,
everybody&#39;s bullshitting you to try to
get in your pants. Like, it&#39;s like it&#39;s
constant bullshitting, you know? So, you
have to figure out, well, who&#39;s actually
bullshitting me and who&#39;s just being
nice? And who&#39;s being nice, but kind of
bullshitting just slowly playing this
game. You ever heard of the the
definition of a gentleman? No. It&#39;s a
patient wolf.
Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah. And then
ultimately, the prey sort of
acknowledges, yeah, here you are. You&#39;re
getting into my pants in the end, but
because you&#39;ve been the most patient,
the most impressively patient of all.
Yeah. You&#39;ve done the dance correctly.
You put your feathers out like a good
peacock. Yeah.
I like that. I like that dance. Yes.
Yeah. Well, that&#39;s the thing is like
women are designed to like that dance,
right? Because this person has shown you
the respect of not just trying to use
their physical force and take take it
from you and not care about you as a
person. They&#39;ve chosen to acknowledge
you as a person like this is what this
person wants. They want to feel
comfortable with me. But then you can&#39;t
be a sociopath too. It has to be
genuine. You have to genuinely like this
person. So, you know, for a woman to
feel safe, right? Like how do you you
and then that&#39;s you got to go through a
lot of trial and error with that too.
You have to figure out like why&#39; that
relationship fall apart? Oh, that was a
piece of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Like why&#39; that one fall
apart? Oh, she was a psycho. like
recognize like what what do you actually
like? Is it just that they&#39;re hot? This
is the thing. Like I&#39;ve had a bunch of
friends that just married hot people and
then you know you going through divorce
and it&#39;s all chaos. You can&#39;t just
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] marry hot people. Like just cuz
they&#39;re hot and they&#39;re sexy and they
turn you on. Like that&#39;s just genes.
Like you got to you got to understand
like there&#39;s a personality involved. And
then there&#39;s also like when you&#39;re hot
you have ultimate power. You have the
Willy Wonka golden ticket. Like
everybody&#39;s stumbling at their feet to
try to like open doors for you and be
nice to you, put you in prison.
Yeah. Open a certain kind of door. I
mean, we all forever.
Yeah. It&#39;s um It&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] It&#39;s
flirting. It was flirting in the end.
That&#39;s all it was. Yeah. Being a
person&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] weird, you know? It&#39;s
really weird. It&#39;s really weird and it&#39;s
temporary. It&#39;s like you&#39;re always
looking at that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hourglass just
sands running out, you know, and like
what am I doing? Why am I doing it?
What&#39;s this about? What do I like? What
do what don&#39;t? And then you can get
overwhelmed with the like existential
angst. Just what&#39;s the point of it all?
Yeah. Well, you have to find a point.
You have to like what is man&#39;s search
for meaning? Like what is it? What are
we doing? I don&#39;t know. Well, that&#39;s a
subtitle of my book, My Search. My
Search for Meaning. Oh my god. It is
right there in cursive. If you can still
read cursive, some people can&#39;t anymore.
Is that your actual handwriting? No, I
wanted it to be my actual handwriting,
but is it [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
They were like, &#34;This looks so much more
pretty.&#34; I You could have made it that
pretty. I do have great handwriting,
man. What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] It&#39;s close.
Might as well. It is odd. Yeah, the the
search for meaning. Search for meaning
is very odd. And you know, and you could
especially when there&#39;s no inherent
meaning. You just have to make it up. I
think I mean it means something to you.
If it means something to you, it&#39;s
inherent. It&#39;s real. If it means
something to you, if you actually care,
it means something. Like, what&#39;s the
point of it all? If you&#39;re going to die
someday and who knows what happens when
you die. And then then there&#39;s the the
real fatalistic thing. When you die,
it&#39;s over. It&#39;s just black and
emptiness. and then just shut off like,
&#34;Okay, so you&#39;re still alive, bitch.&#34;
Okay, you got to figure out what you&#39;re
doing with your day-to-day. Do you enjoy
your dayto-day? If not, why do some
people How come some people enjoy their
life? Why don&#39;t you like what is man&#39;s
search for meaning? Enjoy your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
life. Enjoy this life. You can, it&#39;s
possible. Can be done. And I think
living by example shows other people
that it can be done. And then being like
really honest about it like what is what
are what are the steps? What&#39;s the
struggles? like how do you do it? Yeah,
that&#39;s actually been a really sort of
fun takeaway that I&#39;ve had from having
just an Instagram is like I&#39;ll post a
silly video of me dancing for my kids
and a lot of the comments are just
people being like I&#39;m so glad that
someone like you can be happy. Yeah. You
know, it&#39;s like thank God someone like
you can be happy. And I&#39;m like, yeah,
someone like me can be happy. That means
you can be happy, too. It&#39;s possible to
be happy. Yeah. But you know, when
you&#39;re a 500B person and you want to be
thin, that&#39;s a long road. It&#39;s not going
to come quickly. And if you&#39;re a
severely depressed, very unhappy person
with a disaster of a life. It&#39;s not
going to turn around overnight. That&#39;s a
battleship. It takes a long time to turn
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] around and get it facing the
other direction. And and the motivation
has to be that you have to see some
kernel of opportunity embedded within
that darkness because otherwise like
where what how do you even know what
direction to go towards and you have to
be enjoying the process. You have to
figure out a way to enjoy the process of
improvement and and to even though it&#39;s
hard. Yes. And because it&#39;s hard hard
can be fun. Yeah. Yeah. You have to
enjoy the hard and that&#39;s why voluntary
adversity is so important. You have to
force yourself to do hard things so that
you can do hard things no matter what.
If I do what&#39;s pump up remixes
someone you got to get motivated
somehow. Yeah, that&#39;s true. That&#39;s true.
Although David Gogggins doesn&#39;t listen
to music because he thinks it&#39;s
cheating. Really? Yeah. He gets all his
motivation internal. He&#39;s like external
motivation is cheating. He&#39;s a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
complete psycho, you know. But he&#39;s like
I need a good soundtrack when I&#39;m
running. But that&#39;s the spectrum, you
know, the spectrum of discipline, you
Yeah. That&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. That&#39;s
what he&#39;s doing. That&#39;s what he&#39;s doing
all day long for no goal other than like
I talked to him about it. He&#39;s like, I&#39;m
in the lab every day downloaded
information. Like, whoa, cool, dude.
You&#39;re in the matrix. There&#39;s a there&#39;s
a crazy video of him um working out with
my friend Israel Adosana. Israel Assagna
is the former UFC middleweight champion
of the world, one of the greatest
fighters that ever lived. And he is
working out with David Gogggins and he
can&#39;t keep up with him. And David Gog is
just breaking him and he&#39;s throwing up
in garbage cans and David is putting him
through his workout and it&#39;s one of
three workouts that David does in a day
and he&#39;s like this incredibly fit world
champion fighter. Is he distracting
I don&#39;t know. You have to talk to him.
You have to dig into that brain. You
have to dig into that. That&#39;s a very
unusual brain. But he was 300 lb and fat
at one point in his time. And in and
become his purpose. That&#39;s his meaning,
right? That makes sense. That&#39;s his
meaning. That&#39;s why he says he&#39;s like,
I&#39;m he goes, I&#39;m downloading knowledge.
Like every time he&#39;s like pushing
himself past the limits that he thinks
he&#39;s capable of further and further,
he&#39;s downloading more understanding of
himself. That&#39;s We should work out some
time, by the way. I think that would be
fun. I I only studied I only studied
fighting when I first got back out of
prison because I was getting a bunch of
death threats. So I did Krav Magaw
and it was a lot a lot of it was just
learning how to scream. Um yeah well the
first like my Krav Maga instructors
because they were instructing me on a
specific for a specific reason. It
wasn&#39;t just to work out. Their first
thing that they taught me was how to
scream. Just to like without without
holding back the the the amount like I
was surprised and and they were telling
me people don&#39;t want to take up space
and take and make noise. Like we&#39;re
we&#39;re taught from a very young age,
especially women, to not do that. And so
you have to in the first the first
lesson was make noise, take up space. M.
And and so we just practiced like
screaming as loud and as hard and as
long as we could. And then once we got
through that, then we started doing the
fighting moves. And the first thing I
had to do before I did anything was
scream first then move. Scream, move.
And so that the screaming became part of
the uh the movement. So it would it
would trigger so I wouldn&#39;t have to
think about it. If it ever came down to
it and someone actually attacked me, I
wouldn&#39;t have to think scream. I would
just scream. Croft McGaw is legit. It
gets uh criticized a lot. Does it?
Whatever. Yeah. By martial artists. Why?
Well, because it&#39;s a combinatory martial
art. So, it combines a bunch of
different things together. So, it&#39;s
essentially like a jack of all trades.
What&#39;s wrong with that? There&#39;s nothing
wrong with that. Oh, okay. No, no,
there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s
like only being into purebred dogs.
Like, what what&#39;s up with that? Well,
no. It&#39;s like is it effective, right?
Like there&#39;s no Krav Magaw artists that
have gone on to dominate in the UFC. Oh,
interesting. Yeah, I didn&#39;t know that.
But it kind of you could kind of say
that mixed martial arts in a sense is
essentially the roots of Krab magga
because it&#39;s taking the best aspects of
various martial arts and training them.
Yeah. How is it different? Well, the
thing is is that if you are training for
self-defense, okay, you&#39;re training to
defend yourself in against an attacker,
the the true in my personal
opinion, the true best way to learn how
to fight is to learn how to prepare
yourself for trained
killers. Not the average person. Really?
Yes. Like, how often are you going to
encounter trained killers? It doesn&#39;t
matter. You should be prepared for train
killers because you could run into a
trained killer and if you try to do some
crab mag nonsense on me, I&#39;m going to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] strangle you. You can&#39;t defend
yourself against someone who actually
knows how to fight. Okay, here&#39;s a
question. Can I ever actually defend
myself against someone like you? No. Not
against someone like me. What&#39;s the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] point? Because you could defend
yourself against someone who doesn&#39;t
know how to fight as good as me. But the
odds of someone like me attacking you
are very very very very small. I should
train to be able to, you know, to fight
against trained killers. But yes, defend
yourself. But jiu-jitsu you can
jiu-jitsu you could defend yourself.
You&#39;re you&#39;re not going
to the way you would be able to beat me
as if I was untrained. The I have too
many advantages. But also, I don&#39;t have
advantages if someone&#39;s bigger than me
and just as well trained as me, right?
Or more well trained than I am, better
than me. That I don&#39;t I&#39;m I&#39;m not going
to beat, you know, the UFC heavyweight
champion. Like, I&#39;m I&#39;m not going to
win. It&#39;s not not possible. I don&#39;t care
how long I do martial art. You can avoid
dying by them. No. No. Okay. They&#39;ll
just murder you. No, I can&#39;t. No. No.
I&#39;m I&#39;m completely vulnerable. Okay,
great. As an expert martial artist with
three black belts, I&#39;m completely
vulnerable. Yeah. That&#39;s reality. That&#39;s
physics. That&#39;s I mean, it&#39;s like you
against an elephant. Who&#39;s going to win?
Exactly. Exactly. That&#39;s the 100 men
versus a gorilla. Yeah. Obviously, the
gorilla would win. Who ever thought the
gorilla would lose? Retards. Men who
have never seen a gorilla. Men who think
they could fight better than they can,
which is most men. Why? Who who ever
brought up that as even a thought
experiment? I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s funny
that it&#39;s like viral in 2025. I thought
we would have worked that out in the
The fact that I feel like people just
don&#39;t remember what animals are like.
We&#39;re so out of touch with animals. They
don&#39;t even know what an animal is. They
have no idea. People know what their dog
is. They have no idea what an animal is.
An actual real animal. And also, your
own dog could [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you up if you want if
it wanted to. It just doesn&#39;t want to.
Exactly. Yeah. Well, unless you have a
little dog. I&#39;ll [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up a Chihuahua.
Yeah, but my dog Marshall, he&#39;s a golden
retriever. He&#39;s the sweetest dog on the
planet. But if he he could probably kill
me if he want. He just doesn&#39;t know, you
know, right? And he would never think
to. But like, but if like a rat was
trying to attack you, he&#39;d be [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
terrified. Or if he got infected by
rabies, right? You know, like, and lost
his mind, like, right, ciao. It&#39;d be a
real problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
there&#39;s there&#39;s the reality. But if
you&#39;re training to defeat a trained
killer, you&#39;re going to be way better
off than if you&#39;re training to defeat
someone who&#39;s going to lunge at you this
way and you&#39;re going to block that and
hit him here and hit him there and like,
but don&#39;t you fight differently against
a trained killer versus like some dude
who&#39;s like drunk? The right way to fight
is the right way to fight. Period.
Whether it&#39;s some drunk dude, if if some
drunk dude tries to take a swing at me,
I&#39;m not going to think, &#34;Oh, he&#39;s a
drunk dude. I shouldn&#39;t avoid this
punch. I should do something different.&#34;
No, it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s all the
language. So, martial arts is
essentially like a language. And some
people only know a couple of words and
some people can eloquently recite
Shakespeare at the drop of a hat. Sure.
And that&#39;s the difference between an
expert and someone who doesn&#39;t really
know what they&#39;re doing. and most people
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing when it
comes to martial arts. If you&#39;re
preparing for someone who doesn&#39;t know
what they&#39;re doing, that&#39;s not the right
way to do it. The right way to do it is
to prepare for someone who knows what
they&#39;re doing. Now, this is very
different when we&#39;re talking about like
women&#39;s self-defense versus just, you
know, uh like a a a grown man who is of
normal size defending himself against
another grown man of normal size. A fair
fight. Yeah, a fair fight. But in a fair
fight, you should be preparing to fight
against a trained killer. If you are a
person who just only trains in
self-defense tactics, like someone comes
at me, I&#39;m going to do this and I&#39;m
going to do that. Good luck doing that
to someone who knows how to fight. Good
luck. Cuz they&#39;re going to recognize all
of your movements in advance. You&#39;re
going to go like this and they&#39;re going
to go, &#34;Oh, well, his right arm is
coming this way, so I&#39;m just going to
step this way and I&#39;m going to avoid
that.&#34; And I see his left foot step
backwards. Well, now his right leg is
vulnerable, so I&#39;m going to kick it.
Like, it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s language. It&#39;s
understanding the flow of body dynamics
and movement. And it&#39;s happening so
quickly that the only way that you can
actually be effective is if you&#39;re
fluent and you don&#39;t have to think about
it. You don&#39;t think about it. It&#39;s when
you&#39;re training, it&#39;s like you very
rarely think, &#34;Oh, now I&#39;m going to do
this.&#34; It&#39;s like opportunities open
themselves up, especially in striking.
striking is something that you you do
where you&#39;re you&#39;re doing these
techniques so often that as things
happen, you&#39;re just responding in a
trained way. Your mind and your
neurosystem is is like completely
trained for these actions and these
movements. Do you think that
fighting and you know fighting your
friends like not like actual like
fighting for your life but fighting for
your friends is a crucial part of brain
development? because I know that I&#39;ve
heard or at least I&#39;ve read that
roughousing with small kids is a really
important part of their brain
development and and the the people who
become more um well adapted, well
adjusted emotionally, just they seem to
be more fit emotionally were kids who
had some roughousing when they were when
they were young, especially with their
parents. Is that is that like an
elevated form of roughousing part of a
human being&#39;s cognitive development?
Well, I think physical altercations are
a normal part of human existence that
have exist. It&#39;s been going on since the
beginning of time and to no
understanding or no knowledge of it and
no experience with it at all cuz I&#39;m not
like I&#39;m not a fighter. I don&#39;t like
I&#39;ve never got into a physical fight
with anyone. Good. Is that good? Is that
good? I haven&#39;t either other than ones
on purpose. Right. Okay. Like I&#39;m not I
don&#39;t get in street fights. I don&#39;t I&#39;ve
never got I haven&#39;t been in a fist fight
since I was a kid. I just They were all
martial arts fights. Okay. I I you know,
and I just think for for men being
vulnerable is not good. It&#39;s just not
good to not know how to defend yourself.
It just it leaves you with this deep
insecurity. And that&#39;s why you see men
that don&#39;t know how to fight, they use
bravado and they puff their chest out
and they yell. They try to intimidate
people and scare people. It&#39;s just
posturing. It&#39;s just like maybe this is
why I feel bad for men because I don&#39;t
feel any sort of impulse to to do that
to to puff up my chest and and like I
don&#39;t know. Maybe is it Well, you
shouldn&#39;t. Men shouldn&#39;t either. And the
men that do it are generally vulnerable.
They&#39;re it&#39;s bullies, right? Why Why are
bullies bullies? They&#39;re bullies because
they&#39;re [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] That&#39;s really what it
is. It&#39;s why they&#39;re trying to
intimidate people and hurt people. It&#39;s
because they&#39;re they&#39;re weak. It&#39;s like
you like trained fighters are some of
the nicest people. Like people that
fight in the UFC, they&#39;re some of the
nicest people you&#39;ll ever meet. It
sounds crazy. Like my my friends that
are all jiu-jitsu people, they&#39;re nicest
people. They&#39;re so friendly. They&#39;re so
because they&#39;re not scared. They&#39;re not
they&#39;re not insecure. They&#39;re not
vulnerable all the time. Most men who
don&#39;t know how to defend themselves, who
like are really mouthy and get get loud,
like they&#39;re just vulnerable and that,
you know, I have a friend and uh he has
real rage problems and he doesn&#39;t know
how to fight at all. And he was yelling
at someone in the parking lot of the
comedy store once and I and I pulled him
aside. I go, &#34;What are you doing, man?&#34;
He goes, &#34;I don&#39;t want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] see
red.&#34; And I get I go, &#34;You don&#39;t know
how to defend yourself.&#34; I go, &#34;One of
one of these days you&#39;re going to do
that to someone who&#39;s like me, but
they&#39;re mean and they&#39;re going to just
say, &#34;Oh, here&#39;s a nice opportunity to
just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] this guy up and you&#39;re going
to wind up in the hospital or worse.&#34;
Like, don&#39;t do this. Like, you can&#39;t do
that. But like, some men grow up puffing
their chest out and they get away with
it and they get away with it if they&#39;re
loud enough or they&#39;re mean enough or
they yell enough and they they, you
know, that becomes their defense
mechanism. They&#39;re they get shitty with
people all the time, but it&#39;s that&#39;s all
it is. And if they don&#39;t get shitty with
people publicly, they get shitty with
people online. They get shitty they do
get out there. They get it out that way.
But it&#39;s all just weakness. That&#39;s all
it is. It&#39;s just like you&#39;re vulnerable
and just don&#39;t be vulnerable. Figure out
figure out a way to not be vulnerable. I
got into martial arts because I was
getting bullied and I didn&#39;t I just
didn&#39;t I was always scared of
altercations. Like I hate this feeling.
So, I was like, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m going to
become what I&#39;m terrified of.&#34;
Okay. I guess my one sort of poke back
at that though is I find it interesting
that you you you frame vulnerability in
in such a negative way. Physical
vulnerability is negative. Yeah. But I I
think the thing that I&#39;m sort of
thinking about is how it doesn&#39;t matter
really how strong you are or capable you
are. We all are still utterly vulnerable
and well sure. And so I guess like but
what can you control? Fair. You can
control some aspect of that. Like you
can&#39;t control guns, right? If you if
someone has a gun, you&#39;re vulnerable. I
don&#39;t care who you are. You could be
Superman. Well, not Superman. He&#39;s
bulletproof. But you could be, you know,
UFC heavyweight champion. You&#39;re still
vulnerable to a gun. One little kid can
kill you. Bang. You&#39;re dead. Yeah. But
how much can you control? you can
control some of it. So, is the idea
like, oh, you can&#39;t control any of it,
so why control at all? Why do anything?
Why why be strong? Well, I guess no. I
guess my my thing is um for me it&#39;s it&#39;s
less about
like prepare like positioning myself to
not get hurt. And it&#39;s more for me my
big sort of like training that I attempt
to do is how do I how do I get up when I
am inevitably hurt. So I I I understand
that life is going to hurt me and I
don&#39;t know how life is going to hurt me.
So there&#39;s like a million different ways
that I can be hurt. It might be that I&#39;m
physically assaulted. It might be some
other thing. and knowing that I can&#39;t
prepare for all of the ways that I am
vulnerable to existence. Instead, I try
to think, okay, I am vulnerable to
existence and I am going to get hurt.
How do I not be broken by the hurt? And
how do
I I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m
treating the inevitable pain of life as
that as that training to get strong.
It&#39;s just kind of like I I almost don&#39;t
seek out pain because I&#39;ve had enough
pain come at me. Is that does that make
sense? I don&#39;t know. What What do you
mean by seek out pain, though? Well, you
you were talking about like uh voluntary
adversity. Yes. Right. And like to an
extent I agree with you because that&#39;s a
very stoic thing to do to seek out
challenges so that you can you can test
yourself and test your metal and push
yourself to become better for the
inevitable things that might happen.
Your but not even just for the
inevitable things that happen just for
your own for the sake just for you as a
human to achieve balance.
You&#39;re we&#39;re all vulnerable. There&#39;s no
invulnerable people. We&#39;re all going to
die. We all are made of flesh and bone
and we&#39;re all weak, right? There&#39;s no
invulnerable humans, but you can be less
vulnerable and you should probably
optimize that, especially as a man, I
think, cuz it with without it comes a
lot of weird insecurities that are not
comfortable and they can trip you up in
all sorts of aspects of your life. I
think maybe this is another like woman
man thing maybe where like women have
to accept vulnerability as like an
inescapable aspect of our lives even
just in our interpersonal relationships.
Like I know that when I walk into the
room I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s going to win
a fight. That&#39;s for sure. Right. Um, and
so knowing that I I feel like I sure I I
I prepare myself in the ways that I can,
right? and I and I&#39;m strong in the ways
that I can, but like I don&#39;t think about
vulnerability
in negative terms cuz I&#39;ve also found
that once you&#39;ve been once you&#39;ve been
once you&#39;ve been forced to reckon with
your own vulnerability, that is when you
find your strength. So, I don&#39;t know. I
I see them as talking about different
things. Yeah. Yeah. I think physical
vulner look I think there&#39;s
certain there&#39;s certain roles that males
and females ultimately play that are
unavoidable and one of them is when your
husband went downstairs to protect you
right there&#39;s a reason why I wasn&#39;t the
one who did that yeah ultimately right
in that
situation if you are less vulnerable as
a man it&#39;s a good thing. If someone
breaks into my house and they&#39;re a
normalsized person without a
weapon, I&#39;m not scared of them. You
know, I&#39;m I&#39;m scared this crazy person
is in my house. I&#39;m scared that they
might have a weapon. But if I realize
that they don&#39;t have a weapon and they
they&#39;re physically threatening, I have a
massive advantage.
It&#39;s up to me whether or not they die.
It&#39;s my choice.
And that&#39;s better. That is better.
That&#39;s better than you getting beat to
death by some schizophrenic who breaks
into your house because you don&#39;t know
how to defend yourself. Fair. And you
panic and you start flailing and you
hyperventilate. You don&#39;t know what to
do. Yeah. That&#39;s not good. No, it&#39;s not.
That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. I mean, we&#39;re all
vulnerable. It&#39;s it&#39;s part of what
you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re working out
really hard is to try to increase the
strength and decrease the vulnerability.
You&#39;re trying to increase your resolve
to push through difficult things,
increase your your your character and
your will. You&#39;re trying to fortify
yourself. And they&#39;re also trying and
that&#39;s not bad to fortify. It&#39;s all
positive. It&#39;s all positive, you know,
but it gets labeled as negative because
there&#39;s a lot of things that get
attached to it like jocks and bullies
and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and and aggressive men and
shitty men who then who think themselves
superior to people who are more
vulnerable. Exactly. Instead of just
being nice because you know you can kill
everybody in the room. Just be nice.
Like that&#39;s the real nice person is the
person who can kill everybody and he
doesn&#39;t want to. you know, the the
really shitty people are the ones that
would act on that. And sometimes you&#39;ll
run into those. And it&#39;s better to be
prepared. That&#39;s that&#39;s all it is with
like physical vulnerability. But what
you&#39;re talking about like psychic
vulnerability and not wanting to go
through pain because you&#39;ve been through
so much. Of course. Yeah. Look, ideally
we should go through zero pain. Ideally,
we should go through zero aggression,
zero shitty, deceptive, conniving,
psycho people that are trying to ruin
everything in your life. Ideally, yeah,
ideally, you shouldn&#39;t have to prepare
for that. You shouldn&#39;t interact with
those people. Ideally, and again, I&#39;m
also like speaking at counterpurposes
with myself because I did the exact
opposite thing with my prosecutor. I
didn&#39;t have to talk to him. I didn&#39;t
have to have an a conversation with him
that was difficult and awkward and and
hard and forced me to confront all of
this pain. And I did because I knew that
there was value in that. Like so
yeah, we we seek comfort always and we
avoid pain. Yeah. But I don&#39;t know,
maybe I&#39;m a masochist because I always
feel like there&#39;s something to gain from
pain because you&#39;ve gained so much from
your pain and you kind of must know that
you are who you are. You know, you&#39;re
kind of an extraordinary person and
you&#39;ve gone through a lot to become that
person. You don&#39;t just wake up and have
this perspective that you have. You have
to go through a lot of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] You know
what&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up though? What? I trust
pain more than I trust
joy. Because when I&#39;m going through
something painful, I know what that is
and I know how to confront it. When I&#39;m
going through joy, I&#39;m afraid that
something bad is going to happen to me.
That happens to people where they self-
you know? I mean, I don&#39;t know. I was
having a great time in Peruia and then
everything just went really bad out of
nowhere. And so, like, I don&#39;t know.
Like a part of me is like always is
trying to see like the the yin-yang of
it all. Like the the the good that&#39;s
embedded in the bad, but then afraid of
the bad that&#39;s embedded in the good.
Like that&#39;s I&#39;m that&#39;s what and you know
and that&#39;s a reality like you know the
more that you now that I have the
privilege of being a mom I know that one
day you know like if something were to
happen my to my kids I would be all the
more [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] de like all the more pain
in my life. Like if I never had kids, I
wouldn&#39;t have I wouldn&#39;t have the
opportunity to experience a potential
pain that would be utterly devastating.
And so like that&#39;s that&#39;s where that
play goes in my head. And I just wonder
if it&#39;s a trauma response where like I&#39;m
afraid of good things happening. I&#39;m
sure part of it has got to be a trauma
response. I mean, I think a lot of
people that self-sabotage when things
start going well in their life, it&#39;s
because they&#39;re used to things going
badly. And this idea of things going
well, this it just scares the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out
of them. It&#39;s the unknown. And it&#39;s the
pain that might come with it falling
apart. The pain that might come with you
hang all your hopes and dreams on, wow,
things really actually are better and
then they&#39;re not. Like, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] So, you
want it to fall apart so that you could
achieve some level of comfort in the
understanding of this state that you&#39;ve
been in many times before, the state of
failure. I need to get rid of that. I
need to I need to lose this. Yeah. But
you&#39;re aware of it, which is the first
step, you know? I don&#39;t think you&#39;re
embracing it. You know, clearly you&#39;re
not. You&#39;re writing books. You&#39;re here.
You got the Hulu series. You got a lot
going on. It&#39;s like it&#39;s not going Yeah.
It&#39;s not like
you still just a little bit like looking
over my shoulder like coming at me.
Imagine if you didn&#39;t. That would be
crazy after all that you&#39;ve been
through. Imagine if you didn&#39;t think
like that, you know?
It&#39;s understandable. More than
understandable,
you know.
Yeah. That whole like lightning doesn&#39;t
strike the same place twice and it&#39;s
it can. It can. It can tell that to
someone who&#39;s been struck by [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
lightning. Yeah. I
Yeah. You know, it&#39;s possible. You can&#39;t
It&#39;s the fear of the unknown and the
fear of the possibilities can really
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you. It really can. I&#39;m trying
not to let it do that to me. You&#39;re
doing a great job. Thanks. You really
are. Yeah. Working on it. But again,
it&#39;s it&#39;s a struggle. And this is
important for people to hear. It&#39;s not
like it&#39;s just like every day like it&#39;s
it&#39;s hard. Life is hard. Even a guy like
Gogggins, you know, he told me and he
goes, &#34;Sometimes I stare at my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
shoes for like 30 minutes before I put
those [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on.&#34; He goes,
because he&#39;s like, &#34;I don&#39;t want to do
this. I don&#39;t want to do this.&#34; But he
knows he&#39;s going to do this. He goes,
&#34;But I put them on.&#34; Well, good on him.
It&#39;s not easy. Life is not easy, but
it&#39;s worth living. It&#39;s worth doing. It
really is. Does he put those shoes on
because he knows that ultimately he&#39;s
going to be glad that he did it? If you
ask him, he&#39;s like, &#34;Because I&#39;m not a
bitch.&#34; Okay. Well,
because but that is what it is. Yeah.
He&#39;s ultimately going to be glad that
he&#39;s he&#39;s still got the strength and
that strength needs to be watered every
day like a garden. It&#39;s not like you
just have it now. You have it for life.
No, you have to you have to keep at it.
You can Everybody could
slide Everybody could slide back. It&#39;s
true. Yeah. As much as we can improve
ourselves, we can Yeah. Not It&#39;s not
easy. It&#39;s not easy being a person, but
it&#39;s worth doing. Yeah. Yeah. And you
could do it. And everybody could do it.
You could do it better than you&#39;re doing
it. I could do it better than I&#39;m doing
it. I&#39;m trying. And you could do it
better than all of us. I&#39;m so grumpy
sometimes. It&#39;s like so unnecessary.
Unnecessary. Avoidable. But it&#39;s good.
It&#39;s good to, you know, struggle&#39;s good.
It&#39;s good. All of it&#39;s good. It&#39;s all
We&#39;re on the path, you know. But this is
like this all this this all this this
idea that you should know better by now.
That&#39;s also silly cuz I know 80-year-old
fools. No, everyone. If there&#39;s anything
I&#39;ve learned from being a mom, it&#39;s that
everyone, every human being is a
toddler. Every single person is a
toddler who either hasn&#39;t gotten enough
attention or hasn&#39;t had their nap,
whatever the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and they&#39;re just
having a tantrum. Like that is and if
you treat everyone like a toddler, it is
actually a very successful way of
interacting with people. Yeah. Yeah.
Like it&#39;s true. That is the lesson of
parenthood, right? Yeah. I I I talk
about that all the time that uh I
started looking at people as like babies
that grew up instead of looking at them
like, &#34;Oh, this is Mike. He&#39;s 35.&#34; Like,
no, Mike was a baby. Like, how&#39;d Mike
