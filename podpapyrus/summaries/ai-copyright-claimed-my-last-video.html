my new instrument volts is available now
for free I recorded it from over
$200,000 of different synthesizers and
gear and it all runs inside of a free
plugin if you want to check it out for
yourself you could find it with the link
down in the
description I have a question for you if
you created a song using AI who owns the
copyright to that song is it you is it
the AI platform that you made it on is
it nobody or or is it the creator of the
data that that AI was trained
on well whatever answer you think you
have you&#39;re probably wrong and I&#39;m
starting to get pretty worried that
that&#39;s about to become a really big
problem if you are a musician or a
YouTuber or an artist or a content
creator of any kind this is about to
become a really damn important question
because this could be the thing that
kickstarts the next great copyright
claiming grift not only here on YouTube
but across I mean basically every
platform on the internet and the
implications of this are absolutely
astounding after all the work and
research and emails and testing and
everything that went into the production
of this video I&#39;m not normally one to
sit here ringing the alarm bells and
doing the oh my God red arrow click face
thing but
I think we might be kind of and
to prove it to you I&#39;m going to show you
how I started copyright claiming myself
using AI generated content for only
about $30 in a couple of minutes in
clear violation of almost all the rules
of all of these platforms with zero
consequences so buckle
in because this is pretty
bad going by the end analytics here as
around 40,000 of you will remember and
as around 600,000 of you may have seen a
little while ago I posted a video where
I tier listed all of the equipment here
in my home studio and then a couple of
weeks later mysteriously that video went
offline and this video at its core is
about why that happened but more
importantly it&#39;s about the absolutely
maddening rabbit hole that all of this
sent me down in that video I decided to
use some stock background music which
normally I don&#39;t do because I write all
the music for my videos but this one was
a little bit different and it was really
long and it was just kind of for fun
while I was editing the video I went
onto a royaltyfree music website and
grabbed some different tracks and I
happened to find one that was AI
generated it was noted that it was
royaltyfree the creator even said so in
the description and I used it I uploaded
the video and a few weeks later wouldn&#39;t
you know it I got a copyright claim on
their behalf and that&#39;s actually a
pretty big deal if you you&#39;re a content
creator or musician you&#39;re probably
already familiar with the absolute
hellscape that is YouTube&#39;s content ID
system I mean this isn&#39;t even my first
rodeo with it I&#39;ve produced several
videos about why it&#39;s an absolute
nightmare like when I almost got a
strike for using a clip of a fight at a
waffle house or my video about why
musicians who use samples or Loops even
though they&#39;re royalty-free in their
music might be liable for copyright
claims against the music they created
with those samples now you might be
asking why should you care about this in
particular
well if you are a smaller YouTuber who
maybe just recently got monetized or
maybe you&#39;re a career YouTuber who has
an external editor who handles the music
in your videos or maybe you run a very
large Channel and edit all your videos
yourself or whatever if you use music in
the background of your videos and it
happens to be AI generated or you use AI
music specifically because you assume
it&#39;s safe for copyright claims YouTube
might have just made one of the most
impactful and terrible decisions when it
comes to copyright and music on this
platform and even though none of it is
really legally
enforcable there&#39;s absolutely nothing
you can do about
it if you&#39;re not familiar when a
copyright claim is filed on your video
on YouTube the monetization from that
video is held in an escrow account this
means that nobody gets the money until
this claim is resolved in the case that
you win you&#39;re all good and you get the
money if you lose though the money for
the that video now goes to whoever made
the claim you could dispute this but
there can be massive consequences if you
lose that dispute you might get a
copyright strike or maybe even lose your
altogether long story short content ID
is a fingerprinting system from Google
that detects copyrighted content from
the internet in its database using a
variety of different Services you or
anyone else could upload content to this
database to have it tracked across
different platforms so that if and when
your copyrighted content is used without
your permission you are notified and in
some cases compensated at its core
content ID was designed as a good thing
it&#39;s there to protect your copyrighted
works and it&#39;s an extraordinarily
powerful tool for copyright protection
the problem is it can be pretty easily
abused so why does this matter exactly
there are no no shortage of distribution
services out there that someone could
use to distribute AI generated music and
get it added to Google&#39;s content ID
database so that anyone who uses it or
uses something that sounds enough like
it to trigger the content ID system to
flag it ends up getting to have their
copyright claim filed and if someone
disputes it it comes back to you to
decide nope too bad and Away you go now
In fairness most of these music
distribution platforms will have some
sort of safeguard that says hey before
you upload this you need to check this
box that says it wasn&#39;t AI generated or
you need to check this box that says it
doesn&#39;t use any commercial Loops or
samples that might trip other people&#39;s
songs up because that&#39;s not fair and
yada yada yada but there&#39;s literally
nothing preventing you from just
clicking the right boxes and uploading
it anyway even though it&#39;s a clear
violation of that platform&#39;s terms of
service so that&#39;s exactly what I
did before we get any further into the
weeds though we should probably take a
quick refresher here on how copyright
works when it comes to music because
even if you&#39;re just a human making Human
music for other humans and you have no
interest in AI whatsoever these same
things that protect your copyrights as a
person are the same things that make AI
music such a nightmare and could even
affect your music even if you&#39;ve never
used or have any interest in AI
whatsoever but we&#39;re going to get into
all that in a minute music copyright
works on just a couple basic
cornerstones after you&#39;ve written a
piece of music you the copyright to it
and this is protected and determined by
just a few key factors like the melody
the lyrics if there are any the
distinctive structure and voice leadings
and other defining characteristics that
identify that specific song against
another one broadly speaking the two key
factors that determine a copyright
dispute are substantial similarity or if
the average person would say the two
songs are the same and the idea of
access or if the person infringing on
the rights of one song could have
reasonably had access to hear the
original and then copy it in some way
determining the outcome of one of these
disputes really falls down to argument
much of the time and that&#39;s really the
source of all the did artist a really
just steal artist B&#39;s song videos and
lawsuits and all that that we&#39;ve seen
about a billion times over by
now all this raises the ultimate
question here does AI generated music or
content really have any sort of claim to
copyright and the answer is
no kind of sort
of maybe back in 2023 the US copyright
office set out a few rulings for how
copyright and AI generated content Works
broadly speaking AI generated content
has no ability to claim copyright
protection and is not protected in any
real way however they did say that if
there is sufficient human authorship
involved then that work may be eligible
for copyright protection this raises the
all to important question what exactly
is sufficient human authorship and the
answer to that is nobody really knows
because this has never been challenged
or taken to court where any precedent
has been set and at least at the time of
making this video this means that we are
still in the wild west hellscape of AI
generated content and its copyright
protection eligibility and it&#39;s going to
going to get a whole lot worse before it
gets any better in fact just a couple
weeks ago I was offered a pretty
significant amount of money to promote
some other AI platform that claims it&#39;s
offering a robust set of monetization
tools for AI creators specifically so
that they can start grifting money off
the internet with all this AI music slob
garbage the core of the problem here
starts to emerge when you think about
not just how AI music is generated but
also how copyright works with music in
general as we discussed earlier these AI
models are trained on databases of music
but almost none of them have clearly
stated where exactly these databases
were sourced from in one rare and
particularly troubling Insight back in
August of 2024 the co-founder of sunno
admitted that their models are trained
on music they sourced from the open
internet the open internet as you can
probably guess is just the internet at
large and this means that any music out
there on the surface web was considered
fair game by any platform that trained
on it this is also why the Raa opened up
legal complaints against several major
AI music platforms claiming that the
platforms were trained on the music of
artists without their consent the
argument here largely falls down to a
thought experiment in the world of AI
content creation commonly referred to as
the Chinese room experiment to put it
very simply if you put a person in a
room where they saw some Chinese symbols
and all they had were some rules and a
data set to reference to create a
response that is accurate and makes
sense they could then output some kind
of response based on the input on the
outside it would appear that whoever is
in the Box clearly speaks fluent Chinese
when in reality they&#39;re just referencing
some rules that they have to formulate a
response without any idea what that
response actually means or implies this
is probably an easy way to see why AI
generated music is a real problem
especially when it generates something
that&#39;s similar enough to an existing
artist&#39;s work and really why it&#39;s a
problem that it exists altogether
because AI generated music has Melody
lyrics and voice leading and the other
General defining characteristics that we
classify as a piece of music technically
it meets all the same requirements that
human created Music does to qualify for
copyright protection now this in itself
could be a whole video deep dive Rabbit
Hole so we&#39;re just going to kind of have
to move on here for the sake of time but
hopefully that makes sense as to why AI
causes so many problems for copyright
and music because whatever it creates in
theory all it would take is someone to
then upload that to a service like
content ID to cause a whole lot of
headaches and problems for the rest of
us to test all this out out I ended up
going onso and asked it to create some
music that sounds like me and of course
there are now protections against asking
it to imitate certain artists but by
engineering The Prompt a little bit and
with a little bit of trial and error I
was actually able to get pretty damn
close to my own
tracks this is something that a lot of
artists and labels are upset at
especially when you see that there are
entire websites or forums dedicated to
prompts that you can use to emulate a
specific artist&#39;s sound you may have
seen this cropping up on different
streaming services where people have
used AI to imitate a specific artist
style and then released tracks or albums
under that artist&#39;s name trying to get
some money out of it One streaming
platform audius even touts this as a
feature and actively encourages artists
to allow people to rip off their music
now In fairness and I guess in the
interest of Playing devil&#39;s advocate a
little bit here you can say that all
music can be broken down and classified
with things like genre and
instrumentation and Arrangement and
whatnot this isn&#39;t that big of a deal
however when you consider that musically
speaking all it takes to cause a problem
here is for one thing to sound enough
like another thing and in this case it&#39;s
an AI generated Thing versus a human
thing but the AI generated thing was
told to generate something that
specifically sounds like this specific
human if that human makes more music or
uses a Melody that sounds similar to the
AI thing and the creator of that AI
thing uploaded that result to a service
that has it to Content ID that&#39;s going
to start causing a lot of headaches for
everybody this all becomes even more of
a nightmare when you understand that
some Services also offer ways to upload
a clip of audio to base a result on this
particular creates a really unique
problem for musicians and labels and
anyone running a music catalog going
forward because when you take into
account something like licensing let&#39;s
say where someone wants to use your song
in a TV show or a video game or a movie
trailer or something and they decide for
some reason that they don&#39;t want to
license it from you because they can&#39;t
afford it or they don&#39;t want to or
whatever all they would need to do is
take a clip of your song and upload it
to one of these AI services that
features a reference audio input
function and then generate something
based on that that&#39;s legally different
enough maybe to circumvent the need to
license it from you as an example of
this check out these two clips I
uploaded a clip of one of my original
songs and then used the AI reference
audio function to generate something
now that really sucks because I guess
you could say that&#39;s different enough to
not technically be the same thing and
that would mean whoever uses that is
free and clear to do so and in theory if
they released the soundtrack for
whatever that went into and decided to
copyright it I could be infringing on
their copyrights maybe to some degree or
if I write more music in the future I
could be infringing on my own copyright
of their maybe copyright because I wrote
music that sounded too much like me and
unfortunately there are no real
protections against this either even
though platforms like sunno will claim
that tracks that are using copyrighted
works or have vocals detected are stuck
as being private or cannot otherwise be
downloaded you could simply record the
output of a free tool like OBS and then
use it and be on your Merry
way as a reasonable human being you
would probably hope and pray that
siphoning money off of creators using AI
generated content and copyright claiming
them would be way more work than it&#39;s
really worth but the truth is it&#39;s
actually really easy and it&#39;s not even
that expensive to get started so I did
it to myself and it took me less than 20
minutes I went onto an AI music creator
I generated some stuff with a free
account I downloaded the track and then
slapped it underneath some footage of me
talking and then uploaded that to my
alternate YouTube account then I created
an account with the music distribution
service I uploaded that AI generated
track and paid the fee for Content ID
all said and done this took me about 15
minutes and cost me roughly
$30 and wouldn&#39;t you know it a little
while later I got a notification that my
video was copyright claimed by me for
using my AI generated
track now you might be sitting there
pretty fing horrified thinking why is
there no enforcement for any of this and
the unfortunate truth
is there kind of can&#39;t be with the
service I used to upload the music even
though I was in clear violation of their
policies for submitting this to Content
ID all I had to do was just check the
right boxes and it was uploaded and
submitted with no questions asked on
YouTube&#39;s end after disputing the claim
on my own video that prompted this whole
video YouTube&#39;s response was simply that
they&#39;re just not in a position to
determine or enforce any of this and
it&#39;s just a matter of too bad so sad
better luck next time sucks to be you
this means that the only real way for me
to take this any further to resolve the
dispute would be to go out hire lawyers
take all of this to court for what would
inevitably be a very long and pointless
and expensive legal battle just to prove
the point to YouTube that this was AI
generated and shouldn&#39;t be eligible for
copyright protection through systems
like content ID ultimately this means
that there&#39;s no real protection and no
real enforcement so if I decided to sit
down and make a bunch of AI generated
music slop and upload that to a bunch of
free background music for YouTube video
websites that are popular and then I
decided to start claiming people through
Content ID well they&#39;re
Fu it probably goes without saying
saying that the implications of this and
how far-reaching they are
is extremely troubling to put it
lightly if you a musician in theory if
your music you wrote sounds too similar
to a track that someone else made with
AI and then they decided to add their
track to Content ID you could get
claimed if someone likes your music but
they can&#39;t afford what are asking to
license it or just don&#39;t want to bother
asking to license it they could just rip
it off using the audio input functions
of some of the more popular platforms
and if the results sounded similar
enough who knows maybe now you&#39;re
infringing on their copyrighted works
because the next song you wrote sounded
too much like you if you&#39;re a content
creator if you use any AI generated
music in your videos all it would take
is for the creator of that AI track to
add it to Content ID and now you are
magically violating their cop
copyrighted work if you don&#39;t use any AI
music but you use music that sounds
close to something that someone
generated with AI they could probably
claim that as well and you&#39;ll likely
lose because YouTube a literal
multi-billion dollar Corporation has
absolutely no way to enforce or
determine the rights to anything and
well it just sucks to be you this is all
a giant Nightmare and you might be
asking what can we do about any of this
and the unfortunate answer is not a
whole lot until we modernize copyright
laws and some of these cases of AI
generated content copyright claims and
such are taken to court and precedents
are set to establish new laws to keep up
with the pace of Technology we&#39;re kind
of doomed and unfortunately the reality
of that is even if one country decides a
certain thing International laws could
vary and you still could be just as
liable somewhere else as you are where
you are now even if you&#39;re a creator
who&#39;s not using AI generated music in
your videos or you&#39;re a musician who&#39;s
not using any kind of AI to create your
music you&#39;re still just as liable to
respect the apparent magical copyrights
of anyone who craps out a bunch of AI
garbage and decides to hit the magical
content ID button the frustrating and
short truth of it all here is that it&#39;s
probably going to take a while before
any of this gets resolved and it&#39;s
probably ultimately just going to be
resolved in favor of whoever has the
most money to throw at the
problem oh
man I guess I should uh maybe apologize
here if this video ends on what feels
like a little bit of a bummer huh I wish
there was a brighter chipper ending I
could slap onto all this with something
I could say or advice I would give or
some action we could take to prevent all
of this or help with all of this but at
least at the time time of making this
video there&#39;s just not so I guess
instead I could end it with this you
should not ever stop making the art or
music or stories or videos or whatever
it is you love to make because of this
whole situation and these stupid AI
companies that let&#39;s be real are
probably just some kind of complicated
VC moneya laundering scheme that we&#39;ll
find out about five years from now
one day you&#39;re going to die and if this
is what you gave up doing the things you
love over you&#39;re going to look back on
your life and die with a whole bunch of
regret and that would suck so I guess
maybe more simply I&#39;ll just end all of
this with my favorite quote of all
time you only get to die
once so make sure it was worth it
hey there me again videos like this are
a pretty huge undertaking and this case
like 160 hours I believe for this video
from start to finish and as you can tell
I am just one person so to research
write film edit and produce one of these
videos it&#39;s a lot of work not to mention
the financial black hole that this
channel continues to be between all of
the equipment and time it takes to
produce these types of videos and none
of this would be possible without the
support of my patrons and other
supporters so if you&#39;re one of them
sincerely thank you literally none of
this would be possible without you if
you&#39;re not one of them though and you
enjoyed this video and you want to
support the channel so I can find enough
caffeine and take enough time off
actually working to make more videos
like this you can join up with the links
down below or if you can&#39;t afford that
for some reason that&#39;s totally fine I
get it you could uh check out my free
instruments or sample packs or whatever
you could share this video or you know
you could just go out there and have a
great rest of your
so uh yeah I guess that&#39;s it you can
now like for real this is actually
getting kind of awkward
okay well I&#39;ll just do it for you then
