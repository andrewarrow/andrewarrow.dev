Hey everybody, welcome to Pod Save
America. I&#39;m John Lovevet. Today on the
show, I sat down with Mark Marin to talk
about the end of his podcast, to talk
about his comedy special, to talk about
politics, Trump, Theo Von, Jerry
Seinfeld, Bill Maher. I think Jannine
Goff came up very briefly. We covered a
lot of ground about uh the right, the
left, life and death. It was a great
conversation. Producer Austin said uh it
was a funny conversation and one of the
darkest conversations we&#39;ve had. And uh
uh you know you you you&#39;ll decide how
right that is. But uh it was really
great. And uh here it is. Hi. Thanks for
being here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re welcome. Nice to be here. I&#39;ve uh
I&#39;ve admired your work from afar, my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, that&#39;s so nice to hear. We all Yeah.
What about up close?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I&#39;m going to see how that goes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. When we you were on
Love It or Leave It in 2017, I went back
and listened to it and my takeaway had
nothing to do with you. you were there,
but I was mostly listening to how I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and uh it was one of the first shows we
did. Yeah. And it was one of my which
was one of the first times I&#39;ve been
doing a show on a stage and I was still
getting the hang of it. And I remember
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when you came on, I really felt you just
not annoyed at me, but like you&#39;re like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Sure. Well, that I think that&#39;s a
common experience for many people with
me. Uh sometimes it&#39;s it&#39;s real,
sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes it&#39;s the
situation itself. It might not have had
anything to do with you. It could have
been a broader like what is this? Why
are we here at this at the improv? It
could have been a lot of things. I
wouldn&#39;t take it personally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I didn&#39;t. I actually I didn&#39;t at the
time. I actually appreciated it. Uh
because I felt like you needed to be one
over. Like you&#39;ve been doing this a long
time. You think you&#39;re going to we&#39;re
going to talk and I and I felt you like
uh uh I felt you like um alpha dogging
me a little bit.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But but in a but not in a bad way. It
was fine. But what I but I but I in
watching you do interviews, I here&#39;s
what I took from it, which is um when
you&#39;re with somebody you genuinely like,
you will not laugh as much, but you&#39;ll
sometimes throw a pity laugh at someone
who&#39;s trying their best who you don&#39;t
care for. And I wasn&#39;t getting that. And
I wasn&#39;t getting that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, I I think what happens is like in
terms of alpha dogging, you know, my
alpha dog is pretty shallow. Like if you
get if you know me uh uh if you know my
heart instinctively uh I&#39;m I&#39;m a pretty
uh mushy guy. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I I think what happens with people I
do know is I&#39;ll laugh a lot if they get
going. Like if I&#39;m on with a couple of
with a with a comic and we have an
understanding. I love to laugh and I
love to be, you know, taken to task a
bit. I like to bust balls. I don&#39;t and
if I have that rapport with somebody I
think it becomes pretty apparent who I
am with people in terms of pity laughs
you know there&#39;s an old radio habit I
don&#39;t know if you if people who started
in podcasting but it seems to have there
is a a radio laugh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh that you do out of politeness and
it&#39;s instinctual and I think after a
certain point you may not know the
difference between that and a real laugh
but it it is an acknowledgement it&#39;s not
always pity it&#39;s just saying like Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, you did it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Got to fill the space to get to the next
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I mean, if it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s funny,
you know, but I I think people know when
I&#39;m really laughing and and I think that
in in terms of uh alpha dogging, I I
think um I I just uh you know, I I get a
little uh uh kind of like stand up
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not full
power play. It&#39;s just sort of a a
defiance, you I&#39;m defying you to, you
know, bring me down a notch.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But you&#39;re setting a bar for if you&#39;re
going to want to have a conversation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re going to have to bring something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t know what you have to show
up empty-handed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. I mean, yeah, because I can talk
probably too much if I&#39;m I&#39;m allowed to.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh I don&#39;t mind it. This is the first
time I&#39;ve done sort of a run of guesting
in a long time over the last month or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. No, no. I noticed I I feel like uh
you&#39;ve done every podcast and I assume
what&#39;s left after this is maybe like the
Geico caveman. Is that what&#39;s after
this? You
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; doing one?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think you&#39;re going to hit
that. Uh maybe that Petco dog.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. Yeah. I I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do
that. I I was kind of strategic in what
I wanted to do for reasons that I had.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh some of them were not the reasons
that were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um sort of uh interpreted. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I I learned recently that, you know,
people are going to
assume they know why you did things or
frame why you did things in their
particular context. And I know why I did
things. And it&#39;s very odd to come up
against these type of people where
they&#39;re like, &#34;You did that because of
this.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;I wasn&#39;t even thinking
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s an example of that? Well, I mean,
for instance, that there was this notion
that, you know, I did a lot of the
comedy podcasts, the more broish ones
that, you know, I I would do or get on,
you know, specifically to take them to
task. And I it really was the farthest
thing from my mind. I just wanted to
make sure that people who were fans of
comedy knew that I had a special out
there. Uh, you know, no matter what ilk
they are. Uh, that was really the
intention because I got into stuff that
I&#39;ve been talking about a long time
about the the the political situation
within comedy. That that just happened.
It wasn&#39;t like that was my agenda. I
didn&#39;t want to talk that to Howie
Mandel. I barely wanted to be on How&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and that does come across.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. But I mean, but it was like, you
know, I know how to have fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. you know, but he was, you know,
spouting his mouth off in sort of a a
boomer, shallow kind of insulated way
that I thought was, you know, way off
the mark. And so I I didn&#39;t engage, you
know, fun mark because it became not fun
very quickly and it became serious and
and he didn&#39;t have much to say.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s talk about politics because uh uh
you have been going off already. Well,
is it? Yeah, it&#39;s just what I put. This
is what I put on the top of the card. We
can edit however.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, no, we don&#39;t have to follow this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; kidding. Just do what you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, you&#39;re kidding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do what you got to do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s kidding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, so in your special, which is great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which is great. You say it&#39;s your best.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I like your last two. I think they&#39;re
both your best.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; End Times Fun, Bleak to Dark.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And this one. It&#39;s kind of a trilogy.
Uh, Panicked.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Panicked. Well, there was a structure
and intention there that I I think uh
over the three I I kind of was able to
focus and and shape a little
differently. I I think there is an
evolution. Well, one of the things you
say in the special is that uh liberals
average Americans into fascism uh and uh
that we have a buzzkill problem. Now, a
lot of the buzzkills listening to this
are going to take issue with that. Uh,
but what is the like what is the
buzzkill problem? Like what is it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, it was sort of interesting even
how I framed that section of the
material like how that evolved because I
it seems that over the last I I think
most of my specials I speak to politics
and culture, you know, in a specific way
because I think I I should I think it&#39;s
my responsibility.
And over time I I especially in this
last episode I figured out a way to what
I felt was finessing it because the
situation culturally and politically for
this special was different than the
other ones and some sort of strange
empathy kind of evolved uh in terms of
my presentation. So, I&#39;ll explain to
you. I&#39;m I&#39;ll answer the question.
But when in my last special, like Bleak
to Dark, where I talked about Christian
fascism, you know, it was sort of like a
I had some swagger to it. I was laying
something down. I wasn&#39;t really
exploring it. It was sort of a heads up
in a fairly cocky way in what you would
say probably what it looks like as alpha
dogging. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, in the special before that, I did a
fairly oporadic closing bit with Mike
Pence blowing Jesus, which is a specific
sort of, uh, homage to a comic that, you
know, had an impact on me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In this special, huh?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You gave him a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Well, you know, you got to do what
you got to do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. No. It was more like as I get older,
I I realize what my influences are and I
realize what part they play in certain
bits. like I can kind of identify it.
Um, so I see it that way. I I see that
like I would not have been inspired to
to navigate this joke without, you know,
Hicks. So that&#39;s that.
But in this special, because I started
doing it after the election or maybe a
little leading up to it, I I I found
that at the audiences in the theater
that there was a you know there was a a
frightened, desperate, angry
uh vibe which was, you know, justified
and real and desparing. And so over time
of building the material, I realized
that I was sort of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; doing some sort of community service in
in a real sense that, you know, these
are, you know, liberals, Democrats, you
know, Democrat liberals, Democratic
liberals, whatever to the left of of
center that these people were were
showing up. I don&#39;t know their lives. I
don&#39;t know how long they&#39;re sitting at
home alone on the phone. I don&#39;t know
what they&#39;re doing. Uh but I did know
they were scared and I knew I was in the
same boat. So I figured out a way I made
a decision this this special to to speak
directly to them, you know, not just
posture as one of us,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but to to say, &#34;Look, I&#39;ll do this for
you. We&#39;re all in the same boat. Uh we
all have flaws. There&#39;s funny things
about us. I don&#39;t have any answers for
you, but I can give you that kind of
relief of of being of sort of taking
pokes at at who we are.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. and and that joke. And I
think it&#39;s a a problem now too with
comics and
comedy. When I do comedy, when I say we
annoyed the average American into
fascism, that&#39;s a joke.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it&#39;s a joke. But it resonates
and it resonates for a reason because
I&#39;ve also lately been exploring the
difference between anger and hate. that,
you know, anger
as a tone in all its spectrum is is not
always entertaining. And, you know,
self-righteous anger is is about the
most intolerable anger. Yeah. And even
if you believe what the person is
saying, you want them to shut the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So the so that that joke and and
to answer your your question, I think we
know what these things are and I don&#39;t
know that there&#39;s a way around it. I
mean that&#39;s going to take some sort of
uh amazing vulnerability and empathy in
the face of a completely unsympathetic
and terrifying force to to make it not
annoying. But I mean I think that&#39;s sort
of what&#39;s at stake.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. It&#39;s funny because
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; did that make sense?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, it does make sense. Well, I it&#39;s
even when I was thinking about what I
wanted to talk to you about, I know when
I say, you know, oh, you and the special
joke about America having a buzzkill
problem, annoying people into fascism,
that people are going to say, well,
that&#39;s not fair. It&#39;s obviously more
complicated with that. But that&#39;s why
it&#39;s a joke,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is it? But see, the and I say it in the
special that, you know, in terms of a a
real organized left, you know, when was
the last time we had that? And look, I
did Air America. I know what it&#39;s like
to deal with different factions of the
left and even within, you know, the the
Democrats trying to figure out how to
platform the left, right? And I know
that there&#39;s very insulated, very
committed groups of people to very
specific things that are all all part of
this big umbrella idea. But there is no
unifying policy. There is no unifying
community. There is no know it&#39;s not
it&#39;s not as simple in terms of what it&#39;s
become as what Bernie preaches you know
the original American left right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so when you have all that fragmentation
what becomes annoying is people&#39;s
commitment to their specific cause as
righteous as it may be it doesn&#39;t fit
into the umbrella of the community
necessarily it does not have that much
significance on its own I mean some
issues do so It almost becomes I you
know I don&#39;t want to use the word virtue
signaling but there is a a sort of
righteousness and I get the whole idea
is like pick an issue and you work it
but but bigger problems abound.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Well I I so my take my take on it
is uh we do have a problem of being
buzzkills that that Americans do have a
very dim view of of Democrats. Americans
do find Democrats annoying. Why is that?
One reason they&#39;re kind of annoying.
That&#39;s true. Another is uh yes, there&#39;s
like a kind of a collective sense of of
loss and and righteous anger and
uncertainty around the fact that that&#39;s
even more extreme this time because at
least in 2017 you can say half the
country didn&#39;t vote for this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a fluke. He he won the p the
electoral vote, not the popular vote.
But we lived through it and the country
embraced it and and he won a majority
this time, which makes it even more kind
of of um enraging and and and insecure
poking kind of experience for the left.
But there&#39;s also a big right-wing
apparatus that exists to take all these
things and the most annoying liberal and
make them famous. Uh there is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah they turn it they turn it around
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then there&#39;s social media that takes
the most annoying bits of things like
like all like you know you make a joke
in your special about the Ovon it&#39;s very
funny it&#39;s a great joke it is everywhere
it is everywhere that gets pulled out
right and it gets spread because it&#39;s
it&#39;s great it&#39;s great material it&#39;s very
funny it&#39;s re it&#39;s resonant um but it&#39;s
not surprising that the more thoughtful
and circumspect parts of the special uh
are it&#39;s Not surprising those parts
aren&#39;t what&#39;s online. What&#39;s online is
the the bit about that sensational.
Yeah. The rword and the Theo von thing.
A couple of the smaller ones did okay
out there. But yeah, there&#39;s a lot in
the special. And, you know, I had to
think about, you know, what that Theo
Vaughn joke would do because there&#39;s
this idea, there&#39;s a talking point, uh,
within the right-wing, you know,
tribalized comedy community that any
sort of criticism is some sort of
jealousy, which which it isn&#39;t. Uh, and
I had this this issue years ago before
this type of stuff. If if you&#39;re going
to be critical through humor of people
in your own profession, there&#39;s always
this sort of stigma to it. But I believe
that if somebody becomes a cultural
phenomenon and they are part of the
culture cultural apparatus that they&#39;re
fair game.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and I you know and I think theo joke
at its base is funny. You know what it
implies you can do whatever you want
with that. Sure. It&#39;s it&#39;s an easy
correlation to make to Trump or to
humanizing fascism, but in and of
itself, the impression was good enough.
You know, the jokes that I put within
him talking were funny. Yeah. I mean, I&#39;
I&#39;d be hardressed to think that he
didn&#39;t think it was funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s really funny. It&#39;s good. Uh but I&#39;m
just my point is only that like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sure the apparatus is it&#39;s impossible to
fight against. And you know that that&#39;s
a whole other problem that the the left
messaging is is never going to be as
efficient because we don&#39;t have an army
of frustrated teenage boys who have been
taught over the last 20 years that this
is all some sort of game and that
trolling is a pastime and they were sort
of turned out and radicalized by uh you
know Bannon and and and and it just the
apparatus it it feeds itself and people
who are doing it are not ideological
thinkers or or or deep guys. They just
are in it for the the game.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s what I mean
about it being going further than just
the left being annoying,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of course.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But but but it but it&#39;s also there,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, you look at in the past,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m talking on a human level.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On a human level, but but when when
countries have embraced right-wing
fascistic leaders, right? Germany, the
economy is in shambles. Millions of men
were in World War I. Their brains are
all up. Uh there&#39;s no word for
it. They the only advice is for everyone
to whisper, right? Like there&#39;s nothing.
And they embrace this autocrat. America
had a lot of problems in 2016. We had a
lot of problems in 2024, more than we
had before. Uh but we don&#39;t have let&#39;s
try autocracy problems. But there&#39;s
something about this era, whether it&#39;s
social media or what&#39;s happened in the
economy, that&#39;s led people to feel this
like loss of meaning, loss of purpose,
loss of order, and they&#39;re casting out.
And Donald Trump had purchased with a
lot of those people. A lot of people,
turns out, were excited about someone
like Donald Trump their whole lives. We
just didn&#39;t know it, which is very
frightening. Uh, but there was a lot of
people that were just receptive to
someone like Donald Trump in a way that
I think was very surprising. It was
surprising to me. I don&#39;t know if it was
surprising to you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Look, anger and the excitement of being
validated uh and having your grievances
honored uh despite any sort of um you
know human connection to them. I think
it&#39;s appealing to angry people and the
people that weren&#39;t angry were annoyed
and they may be untethered. They may not
have any real sense of civic
responsibility or even the structure of
government. They just knew that it it
felt good to be able to double down on
hate and to double down on othering and
to double down on bullying. I think most
people have an innate bully. I think
that empathy is a muscle that you have
to work and at some point the Democrats
are okay at that. But I don&#39;t think most
people are naturally empathetic. I used
to think that. But I also think that a
lot of this propaganda you&#39;re talking
about and the sort of intensity of what
we&#39;re taking in on a day-to-day level
creates the the mental relationship with
the information creates a kind of mania.
Uh uh I just watched a brilliant
documentary this morning that I&#39;ve
watched all this guy&#39;s stuff.
It&#39;s a guy, he calls himself Elephant
Graveyard on on YouTube and he did and
it&#39;s specifically focuses on the
alignment of of of politics and comedy.
He did one called the comedy zar uh
about the Rogan sphere and the
manosphere and he did one uh just today
about it was called um I&#39;ll tell you
because I think they&#39;re important to
watch because it&#39;s sort of the world
that you know I live in. It&#39;s called
comedy Jonestown. how comedy was
destroyed by an anti-reality doomsday
cult. And I think that that is a bigger
conversation about what you&#39;re saying
that, you know, the propaganda and the
existence of social media platforms and
what they can do to the human brain and
what they can do to ferment a sort of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, mania is a good word for it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That enables it. You hear it in people
on these mics and I used to do it. But I
I used to do morning radio and I knew
what it took to get it up to do that,
you know, for three hours. You know,
you&#39;re up at 3 in the morning, you&#39;re
crunching news, we&#39;re doing comedy bits,
you&#39;re live. So there is there was a
mania to it. And if that mania has a
specific ideological thrust that&#39;s
driven by talking points and, you know,
basic debate exercises, uh, it&#39;s
rewarding and it lands and it makes you
feel good. Mania makes you feel good.
Yeah. And it&#39;s and it has sort of left,
you know, conservative radio, talk
radio. It was in your car and a lot of
people listen to it. You know, a lot of
salesmen and trucks drivers listen to it
all day every day. It was like kind of
this secret audience for it. Uh but you
got out of your car and it stayed in the
car and you lived your life. And now
that kind of frenetic pace follows us
all the time. And I do think like you&#39;re
going to look back in this era and say
what happened and we&#39;re going to look at
the way in which we all kind of whatever
direction it was we were all
radicalizing each other uh through
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; totally our phones
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and and but radicalizing in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That the information is is fleeting and
and unfounded but if it fits your
feeling then just drive it. Yeah. And
now it&#39;s it&#39;s everywhere. people. It&#39;s
the guy in this new documentary in the
the Doomsday Cult documentary identifies
something about
uh collaborators that may not have seen
themselves as being willing
collaborators at the beginning, but they
go through something called I think he
called it philoside, which is where you
don&#39;t kill yourself, but you kill
yourself inside. And if you look at
somebody like Mark Rubio or or anybody
within that administration in in what
happens in cultlike behavior is sometime
some point after another in order to
stay in the game they kill whatever
principles they might have had even
though they were a few.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. They surrender to it. And there
there&#39;s also I think another part of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and killing it is probably better
because that sort of supports the mania
element that you have to you have to
surrender but you have to aggressively
push it back.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh because you literally have to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; your personality is in conflict with
that until it&#39;s not. You know look we&#39;re
doing Germany. We&#39;re doing 1984. Deal
with it. But like you know in 1984 it&#39;s
about letting go. You know you&#39;re
fighting against this tide. You&#39;re
fighting against this tide and all of a
sudden just like you know what I&#39;m just
going to float. But that&#39;s the rest of
us. That&#39;s not the operatives. I mean,
the operatives, you know, they they make
a deal.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They make a deal.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like, I mean, I, you know, have had to
on some level believe and and accept,
not in the way that I surrender to it,
that we&#39;re currently in an authoritarian
country. I have to see it that way in
order to exist in the in in my life. I
have to frame it like that. I&#39;m not
saying that there&#39;s not hope, but I I do
think that what we&#39;re up against is
something more than a like a two-party
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and I think this is where you get
back to like why did it happen now? And
yes, it&#39;s the phones, but there&#39;s some
one way I think people rationalize it is
is is around well, you know, I don&#39;t
like Trump, but I really hate the
Democrats, right? Or like I
don&#39;t I&#39;m not totally on board with
this, but both sides,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but that&#39;s a false equivalent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of course it is. Of course it is. But
what I what I what I see there&#39;s a there
there is a reason that Donald Trump
gains purchase in this ecosystem of
podcast at the same time that a bunch of
this anti-woke anti-trans masculinity
core uh takes hold at the same time and
it has to do with some there&#39;s some way
in which a lot of men feel lost and and
there&#39;s there&#39;s order and meaning in
what Trump offers in what uh kind of the
Rogan kind of way of learning about the
world are pretty powerful
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and you know this these docs that he
talks a lot about the the daddy hole in
these guys you know from bad daddies
that void yeah
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that needs to be filled and you know a
lot of megalomaniacal people come from
that Trump comes from that I mean look
I&#39;m no psychiatrist or psychologist
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know but in order for someone to
define themselves especially if they&#39;re
lost or they feel neutered or or
diminished
if you get the right words into those
people, they&#39;re going to light up and if
they feel like they have a leader,
they&#39;re going to light up. And as
opposed to like, you know, I didn&#39;t like
what the Democrats had to say or
whatever. I think that is all part and
parcel to the the demonization of of
Democrats a as being
not having real policy or not being real
men or not speaking to the working class
because there&#39;s a couple of guys out
there and I I don&#39;t follow as much as I
used to, but it seems like there&#39;s a
couple of guys out there that are
rational um sort of uh level-headed uh
very wonky Democratic politicians.
that are totally inoffensive and and
really bright and and are making it as
simple as possible to understand what
the real issues are. But I don&#39;t know if
that&#39;s what it takes to to get people on
board. And then you got Nuome&#39;s
approach, which is
We&#39;re going to take a quick break. More

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do think we can that that the collapse
society can be tied back to crowdwork. I
think we can get it back to crowd
comedians that are just doing crowd
work. Uh and I in the same way we can
talk about how what goes viral, what
spreads, what gets people&#39;s attention is
conflict. It&#39;s anger.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. satisfying things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Satisfying things
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because cats do too, you know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Sure. Yeah. The things that
scratch some sort of a primitive itch in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Whether it&#39;s like sweet or sad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, cats do. Yeah. Uh, you know,
rescued puppy getting a growth removed
will also get millions of I can watch a
pipe evacuate itself for a minute.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You ever see a video of someone pulling
a tire through a pipe?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, yeah. Great. It&#39;s the best.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ll watch that all day. I guess that&#39;s
all. Kind of primal feal thing. Yeah,
for sure. For sure. Yeah, there&#39;s Yeah,
there&#39;s something about the like that&#39;s
that&#39;s deep in us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What is Oh, yeah. Yeah, like the
pneumatic. That&#39;s good stuff.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One of the most primitively satisfying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, which is also the sound a
person meant to make if they get sucked
out of a plane.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, not not something I&#39;d want to
watch, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, but I&#39;m just saying now a noise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;d be a little more aggressive like
it&#39;d be like Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And there&#39;d be Yes. It&#39; be messy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and windy. So, so trans people. Now,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well, bring it bring it back to
crowdwork is that they&#39;re with all this
othering and with all this sort of idea.
This is one of their big debate points
when you come at them, they accuse
liberals of of being close-minded
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in terms of really embracing other
people&#39;s point of view. And for me, if
that other point of view is shut the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t want to hear it. Yeah. Yeah.
Right. Right. Well, that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; look I mean, so go on about the crowd
work. Sorry. Well, I just think what
happens is once the othering is
successful and and I covered in the
special that you know real rights are
denied and real lives are at stake
because of you know what comics thought
was an anti-woke just was just about
their language issue and now they were
used in under the the sort of oposes of
anti-woke. destroy all the policy that
that helps people who are vulnerable or
marginalized or or in trouble and I
can&#39;t separate them. I I I I will remain
committed to the fact that they did that
that comics helped that. But I think in
in the bigger picture with say crowd
work or the the kind of
you know hackne tropes of tribalized
comedy is what ultimately happens. I
said this to to Howie and and with all
the the proliferations of podcasts is
because the production values are shitty
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and everybody knows them now and because
crowdwork is kind of establishes this
way of of lighting a you know kind of
having an improvisational moment. What
happens to all the stuff that is really
good and and truly creative and
interesting is that the bar gets lowered
to the point where regular people just
adapt to the garbage and and they don&#39;t
seek out the other stuff and the the
sort of uh uh outlets that make the
other stuff are are kind of
marginalized. Mainstream show business
is kind of marginalized. So all this
stuff fits into that anti- elitism kind
of frame of right-wing thinking. Yeah.
And it does it&#39;s a it&#39;s about taste too,
which is that this stuff performs well.
It does well in the world
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for good and for ill. All the
gatekeepers are gone, right? Like that
you can kind of build your build an
audience online. That&#39;s good. A lot of
amazing people have started online.
Connect. Human connection was a limited
resource whether it was through art or
through having to go somewhere to meet a
friend. Like you didn&#39;t know who was fat
until you went to the high school
reunion, right? You didn&#39;t know what
happened to people in your life. So you
saw them at a party. The party had real
meaning, right? Because you connected
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And all of this took out the the the
availability of all this removed the
meaning of liking a comic, discovering
someone, going to a club and seeing
someone&#39;s hilarious, telling your
friends about it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People with researched and respected
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? So yeah, I look and I did a joke
that was, you know, turned inside out by
one particular kind of libertarian, you
know, thinker.
I don&#39;t even want to give him that. He&#39;s
a comic. But I said it was better when
everybody didn&#39;t have a voice. It&#39;s a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it&#39;s a joke.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But it&#39;s the same thing as saying like
everyone&#39;s got a podcast now. But I just
said it like that. So I left myself open
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to like that guy. I see the liberals
are, you know, they&#39;re they&#39;re
totalitarian, you know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s everybody, you know,
cancel culture, anti- anti-woke comedy.
It was about
feeling like there&#39;s feedback that they
didn&#39;t want to hear hear anymore. But I
I also like being a celebrity got worse,
too, which is why I think it was able to
spread so far, right? Like because you
know you were if you were famous in the
1950s you could drive your you could
duke coke get drunk drive your car
through a plate glass window give $200
to the mater at the hotel and it was
gone. Now like James Cordon gets into a
fight pulling a suitcase uh uh down from
the overhead and it&#39;s news and it
follows him forever. There&#39;s a way in
which attention, celebrity, and feedback
have made made having the power of a
platform less fun. And I think that
annoys very powerful people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s predatory.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, yeah. They have to insulate
themselves. But I do still think that
outside of just the kind of emaciated
world of press and this chasing of
clickbait,
I do think in terms of the ideological
bend on it is that it&#39;s anti- elitism,
it&#39;s anti-intellectualism, it&#39;s
anti-expert.
I think it&#39;s all part of that. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that Hollywood has been framed
as elitists. I I think that not unlike
with the universities and the an
intellectual thing was always part of
fascism, but I think that Hollywood
represents elitism to the right and I
don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true. I mean, you
know, movie stars are movie stars, but I
really think that&#39;s where a lot of that
comes from outside of just clickbaity
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But and then there&#39;s also just a
big audience for it, right? Like there
is, it turns out, an audience for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But that but that doesn&#39;t make it
right. Of course not. I I think that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What does that tell us about the people
listening that they they wanted this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, but most people like, so what do
you got? 75 million vote for uh Kamla,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, vote for Trump and there&#39;s 150
people who did what?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are they doing? Who are those
people? Are they just floating? Are they
the ones that&#39;s watching? It&#39;s a lot of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are they doing? So, so I and I
think that in terms of how fascism or
authoritarianism like you know we&#39;ve got
a president who is a thug. So, you know,
his way of doing business is like, &#34;Oh,
you got a got a pretty nice university
here. Hate for anything bad to happen to
it.&#34; You know, like it&#39;s a nice state.
Hate for anything bad to happen to it.
You know, maybe you kick into the
charity. Yeah. It&#39;s it&#39;s straight up mob
But the you know, but like people
like um What&#39;s Vote? I mean, that&#39;s the
guy that&#39;s doing it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, so like, however you see
Trump, you know, he&#39;s still a puppet to
something that is bigger that he doesn&#39;t
give a about as long as he can be
the guy out front. But those guys are
the guys that are dismantling the
federal government in the name of
Christian nationalism. But I think that
the way that business, See, what you&#39;re
saying to me feels like that, you know,
fascism is good for business. Yeah,
because if you like Netflix, like
Netflix will just, you know, co-opt
anybody that can take that algorithm.
And I think you kind of I used to do a
joke about it. I don&#39;t I that, you know,
Netflix can become Reichflixick, you
know, very quickly. And and and I think
the the pivotal moment was when they had
push back from the trans community about
Chappelle. They realized after several
days that that community was not going
to affect their bottom line at all.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they cut them loose
and you know that is how fascism works
in business.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Well, right. Wouldn&#39;t their their
argument and response would be well we
we we believe in being a home for
everybody. So there&#39;s Chappelle, there&#39;s
Ricky Derves, there&#39;s all these kinds of
comics that do the same joke.
Uh, and we have a bunch of uh, gay gay
movies and films and queer stuff and
like we&#39;re a home for everybody and
that&#39;s our answer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. But ultimately, who&#39;s getting the
big deals? Which shows stay on the air?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, what do they keep repeating?
It&#39;s like the bigger audience, you know,
that&#39;s them saying like, &#34;We got this
other stuff and we know there&#39;s a few of
you, but we&#39;re throwing you a bone. So,
shut up.&#34; But the big money&#39;s on the
ones that you&#39;re talking about that
titillate in a certain way that is not
always right-minded. And and look, I I
I&#39;m people can say whatever they want.
Yeah. Like my belief is that eventually
this stuff would have found its level
that ultimately in terms of
you know left-leaning or specific
marginalized cultures you know creating
grassroots action you know by
overwhelming Twitter and stuff that it
when Trump was campaigning for the
second time that was ebbing that it
would have found a level where tolerance
would have maybe reigned because like I
believe that in order for democracy to
work if these guys are doubling down on
intolerance and hate that you you got
nothing to work with. I mean, it used to
be like, you know, you&#39;d get a guy who&#39;
be like, &#34;Yeah, gay marriage. Now the
gays, they want to get married. It&#39;s
ridiculous. the gays.&#34; And then it
passes in his state and over time he&#39;s
like, &#34;I I don&#39;t know. I work with a
guy. You know, they&#39;re nice.&#34; And then
it evolves in the way that democracy is
supposed to work. But I think it should
always be said that what these guys are
fighting for is not democracy and
they&#39;re shameless about it. They can say
that, you know, democracy enabled us to
vote for that guy, but that was the
end of it. And that&#39;s the
loophole in democracy is that you can
freely elect a fascist and then who the
hell knows what&#39;s going to happen,
right? But I I do feel that they are
shamelessly anti-American in their
political ideology. And I I imagine most
of them would own it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry. But no, it&#39;s good. We&#39;re going to
win. We&#39;re gonna win.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I&#39;m glad we&#39;re I&#39;m Let&#39;s talk about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. 2026 everything&#39;s gonna turn
around, you guys. Well, you know, the
the if there Yeah, we can we can do
we&#39;re so The the I will say like
the hope, right, too is like this is
hacky right? A lot of this like
anti-woke comedy is like hacky And
the way you beat that, you can scold
people. Not saying you&#39;re doing that,
but people on social media can try to
scold their way uh to the other side of
it. But the answer is to just be
funny. And the answer is to have a bit
about the ovan that people really like
and and and sort of clicks some turns
something on in their brain and makes
makes it silly to them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. It&#39;s it right, but it&#39;s not going
to make it silly to the guys that are
brain in that direction. It&#39;s not
going to make it silly to the believers.
And the problem with like comedy
comedians as news influ influencers is
that now anything any comic says is a
representation of their personal
ideology. So the ability for them to be
um objective about humor is gone and
they are subjective which most humor is
to a specific ideological bent. And and
sure you can make it as funny as you
want. There&#39;s plenty of beautifully
funny people doing amazing comedy all
the time, but they&#39;re in the shadow of
this momentum of the tribalized comedy
of the of of you know Rogan and again
those documentaries which I highly
recommend from Elephant Graveyard, you
know, Rogan has positioned himself as
the arbiter of what comedy is. And my
the way I framed it in my conversation
with Howie was like, you know, how how
long can you kind of um claim the victim
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? It&#39;s like my question is it&#39;s
like you guys won, woke is dead. What do
you got to keep beating these people up
for? Some of them are losing their
rights. Some of them are being, you
know, you know, literally killed. Some
of them are being deported. And these
are all the big funnies for you guys who
claim to be victims of this horrible
policy. So then why not stop now? Well,
but also part of it is Yeah. But then
also there&#39;s this sort of well, we&#39;re
just comed we&#39;re just comedians. We&#39;re
just telling jokes here. And then it&#39;s
like, well, hold on a second. You can&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they&#39;re not you. Well, you can&#39;t have
the president on uh in the run-up to an
election and give that person a forum,
Trump, uh, and not push back. Uh, you
can&#39;t, uh, get behind him. And then when
you don&#39;t like the consequences, say
like, &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t I I don&#39;t like any
of this immigration stuff, but I&#39;m just
a comedian. I just had him on. He was a
guest. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can&#39;t forgive it. I can&#39;t forgive it.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not Yeah. No, don&#39;t think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it&#39;s like in the sense that like,
well, you should have done your
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, before you you come out and
say, &#34;This is the guy to your army of of
of kind of uh minions who who look to
you for intellectual fortitude and the
proper diet.&#34; and you know what is real
and what isn&#39;t real. So in in a sense
it&#39;s like they&#39;re going to backpedal and
they&#39;re going to backpedal in relation
to what&#39;s kind of like moving through
MAGA in general.
And I I don&#39;t know that it matters. I
mean this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think it does matter. Oh, I think it
does matter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I mean I don&#39;t know that it matter.
Oh, if MAGA buckles they have to
accommodate them. I think we have to be
practical and I can&#39;t go back in time
and make people not endorse Trump, but
people with big platforms realizing that
they were Look, we&#39;re is a decadent and
depraved era in American politics and
American society. And part of that is a
glibess with very serious things. You
have you have uh uh Zalinsky in the
Oval. He&#39;s getting questions about
putting on a suit. His country is being
murdered by Vladimir Putin. He&#39;s getting
jokey questions. Donald Trump is showing
him his hat collection. This is
a depraved and decadent era. And as part
of that decadence, there are people
being glib about life and death
decisions, including endorsing a monster
because it&#39;s good for the Graham. And
that and that and that happened. How do
we help now that there&#39;s a good side to
that which is there&#39;s a shallowess to
that support and that embrace which
means yes, we can say that was stupid. I
don&#39;t forgive you. Fine. But we got to
get those people to realize. We got to
make ourselves feel open to them because
those people with those platforms are
maybe getable as are the kind of soft
Trump voters that maybe got on board
because all their favorite hosts liked
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ll agree with you with that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But I think you&#39;re taking out of the the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;re afraid. They&#39;re in, man. And
they&#39;re in over their head.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you know, there&#39;s real consequences
when you push back against your
authoritarian overlords. And who the
hell knows what they are because once
you get ab above Russ VA vaude I mean
you&#39;ve got the the tech oligarchs. All
right so they&#39;re they&#39;re the real ones
you know whoever&#39;s you know pawned out
you know the you know Vance is a
stoouchge for those guys for Elon and
and Theo and those guys.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So once you get above project 2025 and
you get above Trump then you&#39;ve got
these guys who really seek to destroy
the fabric of of de democratic society.
Okay. So, if you&#39;re on the if you&#39;re on
the payroll of that and, you know,
and you want to, you know, soften up,
you know, there&#39;s a lot at stake, you
know, so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just sort of
we got to say the right thing to these
people and and change their minds
because you don&#39;t think Scott Rubio is
his pants every day. I
mean, you don&#39;t think like any judge
that rules against him is getting like
hundreds and hundreds of death threats?
I mean, this is straight up, you know,
terrorizing So, you know, I don&#39;t,
again, I I know we were heading towards
hope somehow, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and and we don&#39;t need to. Let&#39;s turn
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, but I think that in terms of voters
and whatnot, if if they are still
capable of empathy, you know, underneath
this mania of of grievance validation,
then in so much to say as if they&#39;re
still human, that maybe something will
speak to them. Well, I think that&#39;s
where there is genuine hope. Yeah. Trump
has many powers, talents. Uh, one of
them is he is very good at making what&#39;s
the worst thing about you the truest
thing about you. He&#39;s very good at that.
He&#39;s very good at kind of reaching into
somebody and saying this thing, this
this weakness you have, I&#39;m going to
make that more true. Whether it&#39;s
animist towards immigrants or embracing
their ambition over their politics if
it&#39;s a politician. But one one reason I
think Trump was able to get get back is
because there&#39;s a there was a big hole
and I I everybody listening will be
annoyed am I saying it but whatever
again but the bully pulpit Joe Biden he
left it open and we didn&#39;t understand
how big of a price we were paying for
not having a vocal aggressive relentless
advocate for democracy for just empathy
which is something Joe Biden I think is
very good at uh but had lost his ability
to communicate well and if we can start
getting leaders or and influencers, it
matters now. It&#39;s the world we live in,
to kind of reflect those values more.
Suddenly, a lot of people that were open
to Trump might remember some good parts
of themselves because I I think people
are complicated. And you&#39;re right, in
every person there&#39;s a bully. But in
every person, there&#39;s always an
empathetic uh uh uh part of them as
well. Donald Trump has does a does a
crackdown on immigration. Terrible,
terrible crackdown. And what happens for
the for the the support for immigration
just it itself as a good rises.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. anti-migration antimigration
plummets. Support of immigration itself,
irrespective of the policy, rises to
80%, highest it&#39;s been in decades.
There&#39;s something that you can turn on
in people. That&#39;s what leadership is and
we kind of and we need that. It&#39;s been
absent. I think it&#39;s possible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I agree with that. I mean, I of
course and like historically it happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, you can push back uh and you
can, you know, change people&#39;s minds if
the sadness the weight of it. But like
what happens to like I&#39;ve I&#39;ve become
sort of obsessed with this idea of these
you know these angry white dudes that
you were talking about that were
untethered and and many of them the the
whole sort of angle of uh you know
Democrats used to be like how they&#39;re
voting against their self-interest.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That used to be the big thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How does that happen? You know
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because it feels good to be angry and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well you can&#39;t tell people what their
interests are is one thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well I guess but I&#39;m just economic
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right. So, but now like now it&#39;s like uh
it I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to get more
grim. I I&#39;ll stick with Yes. Maybe
people Well, what you get all these
angry dudes. I mean, and then you offer
them I mean, South Park covered it. The
second one
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; offer them a job in in ICE.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As as you know, non-officer guys with
guns for big money. And that again then
you get into that philosophicide thing
where where you&#39;re they kill part of
themselves to serve this because of
their self-interest. And I guess that
ties in to me with what you&#39;re saying
about influencers and about that if you
can get,
you know, them out from under their
self-interest, which sometimes is just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for a particular uh cause that
determines their brand sort of appeal
that but is rooted in almost nothing. I
mean, how do you make
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; momentum becomes momentum almost? Well,
it just becomes like you you&#39;re just
you&#39;re using it as a marker to sort of
determine your brand. Everyone is is
stuck in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; honoring the context of the social media
platform, right? So, arguably, if you
really want to do it, there&#39;s no free
speech. You&#39;re because you&#39;re trying to
get onto this platform and get traction
with what you have to say in the bits
and pieces that you can do it and make
it appealing to enough people to get you
some sort of recognition so you can get
your grift going or move money into the
right direction. and subscribe to our
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But there&#39;s one of those fake lines.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But also, there&#39;s a difference between
this hyper reality and just sort of
like, you know, going swimming. So, I I
just think that it&#39;s complicated without
a unified message. Entering the
political part of this last special, I
days before I changed the tone of how I
was going to do it. Um because like I
said with that, you know, alpha doggy or
whatever uh thing that like with the
swagger which is either genuine or just
a means for me to confidently a trick to
to deliver it. I decided in this one
just go under it almost be passive about
it like hey everything&#39;s great you know
everything and then move from that tone
because I believed in the spirit of what
you&#39;re doing here that if I do it like
that you know people who aren&#39;t
necessarily like-minded will listen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and and I did some of these shows. I
had a guy come up to me in like Skoi or
somewhere and I did all that stuff and
he came up to me and said, you know, I
think I&#39;m probably the only Trump
supporter in here. And I said, did I get
it right? And he said, yeah, man, he&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you even do with that? I do
think that&#39;s well I think it gets to
something important which is
I feel like a lot of liberals and it
gets to the kind of buzzkill thing a lot
of liberals have kind of had convinced
themselves that if only we can reach
people with the truth they just don&#39;t
have the facts and once they have the
facts we got to get them the facts we
got to make sure the New York Times
headlines are accurate that they capture
things correctly because if people had
the facts they really knew who Trump was
then then they wouldn&#39;t do it but no a
lot of people got behind Trump knowing
who he And that&#39;s a harder, deeper,
sadder problem. And that I think that is
where we&#39;re at now. I think the first
term was, oh, we just have to reach
people to make them understand. Now it&#39;s
wait, wait, wait,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they did understand. They did this
anyway. This is a bigger problem than we
realized. You have to, like you said,
have a leader that believes in liberal
democracy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. and and and can speak to why it&#39;s
good. You know, even with, you know,
creating policy that may, you know,
undermine businesses, maybe, you know,
creating policy for the benefit of all,
you have to somehow re-engage people
with the idea that, you know, they have
a civic responsibility for those who who
don&#39;t have and it has to deliver. It has
to deliver for people because I do think
that&#39;s right. that that people have come
to believe that it just doesn&#39;t matter
that that Democrats uh they overpromise
and they underdel if they deliver at
all. And really the federal government
just doesn&#39;t affect me. And uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s a wealth problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a wealth problem. I think it&#39;s also
a a um a this is this is a kind of
cultural problem right now which is the
assumption that that as things that that
how things were is how they will be that
there are certain things you can count
on, right? Like you can just yeah the
Trump is crazy but social security is
going to function and yeah Trump is
crazy but like he&#39;s not going to ruin
the whole global economy with a by
announcing tariffs for penguins like the
the there&#39;s that I think a lot of people
learned from the first term that things
don&#39;t really get that bad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But that was before they had 2025
in place.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm. Exactly. Of course. Of course.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know and they you know all they had
was Bannon and you know his mystical
beliefs you know churning out executive
orders. But now you have guys that
really know all the weak spots
of the government who are churning out
executive orders.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they had four years to prepare.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Totally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And second term presidents always know
the job better than first term
presidents. They rarely get four years
to to be outside so that the policy
people, the wonks can get their plan
together. That&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s
what&#39;s so different.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. But also, how do you get the young
people that identify with liberal,
democratic or leftist politics, you
know, to focus on
getting involved in in being in involved
in the government and well, I think this
is where it&#39;s like uh uh what what
brings all these disperate groups
together? What makes people see
themselves as part of one movement?
Leadership. And we didn&#39;t have it. and
uh and and Democrats didn&#39;t have enough
trust with non-democrats to believe the
threats to believe what we were saying
about what Trump posed and Democrats
didn&#39;t have enough purchase with less
engaged lefties uh to earn their vote
and to believe that they could be
trusted either to kind of get people
excited and comm
uh the damage that that Biden had uh had
left um but there wasn&#39;t enough time.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the von Dakshepard you. Is there
something about being a recovered addict
that makes you good at hosting a podcast
and having conversation? Well,
I cited as a foundational thing the the
sort of idea of
the seed of of aa thought is that one
alcoholic talks to another alcoholic
about their life and gets out of
themselves.
So on that premise maybe uh I just feel
also that if you have some experience in
recovery you&#39;re very used to people
being very candid uh about showing their
emotions and vulnerabilities and telling
their stories in of the most horrible
things. Um it&#39;s just part of the the
community and part of how it works. So
on that level maybe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah you there&#39;s a lot of people uh that
are miserable and hate their lives and
they&#39;re not brave enough to fix it and
they&#39;re also not brave enough to do
drugs. You know it takes a little bit of
courage I think to ruin your life with
drugs. You&#39;ve joked about that too in
the past.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um and like you know bravery is just a
kind of recklessness that we like. You
know it&#39;s recklessness with a good good
uh a good with a good direction.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know if they see it as bravery.
I I think they&#39;re out of control and if
they survive, they can frame it. You
know, I I don&#39;t My joke was I don&#39;t
trust anybody who hasn&#39;t lost complete
control of their life for a few years.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But all I&#39;m getting at is there&#39;s a kind
of um
uh yeah, a willingness to say it,
right? There&#39;s a it quality. And I
think that like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sometimes it&#39;s a it&#39;s a compulsion more
than willing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, maybe at some point it started as
I&#39;m just I&#39;m I&#39;m furious. I&#39;m angry. I&#39;m
sad. I&#39;m whatever. Oh, yeah. I&#39;m going
to throw this back and change my
circumstances. Uh but there&#39;s a
vulnerability to it, too. I like feel
like like in the addicts that the people
that I know that have had an addiction
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; once they&#39;ve gotten out of it. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, once
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because the hole is open.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The hole is open, but also I do think
that that that there&#39;s um a pain, right?
I think that comes from a vulnerability
and that continues after you&#39;ve beaten
it. But I think it&#39;s part of I think
what makes sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you a good host, right? You you know,
you you are open, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And I&#39;m pretty like, you know, my
my empathy is sort of expanded from
doing it. And and also I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of
innately kind of codependent
in that, you know, I assume that anyone
I&#39;m talking to has their together
more than me and I kind of meld with
them and I kind of pick up their vibe.
And there&#39;s certain times where I&#39;ll ask
Brendan McDonald, my producer, I&#39;m like,
&#34;Did I start talking like an old Jew
when I was talking to Mel Brooks?&#34; He
like, &#34;Yeah.&#34; And did I start talking a
little bit like a black guy when I was
talking to a black guy? happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You mirror. You mirror. Yeah. Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that&#39;s me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t know how they do it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know how they do it either.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. There is something about that that
you kind of like match somebody&#39;s
energy. Are we doing that? I think so.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A little.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re a a little guarded.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You think?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A little bit. It&#39;s okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think I am.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I can bring it down.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, you don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s your show.
You got to drive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t even know how to be I don&#39;t even
know what what&#39;s the What&#39;s the guard?
What&#39;s What should I take down? What do
you think it is? I think you, you know,
you have purpose. I think that we&#39;re all
scared, but you have to sort of keep it
together for the operation there. Yeah.
I I think that&#39;s true locally and
globally. I think I want to make sure I
I know you as a performer and I want to
make sure we don&#39;t land in the
grave, you know, but I want to I want to
be out of it by the end. Um, but I also
want to I want people I want to Yeah. So
I think uh that&#39;s right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I think that if you watch the the
special that I do, you know, I do walk a
tight rope, but it definitely it comes
out funny and it took a lot of time to
do that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And they&#39;re always 70 minutes or
so, huh?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, most people are doing like 35 minute
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Your yours is long
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because it&#39;s like that&#39;s what I came up
in. I&#39;m old school. It&#39;s like you do an
hour. That&#39;s the job. and to do a HBO
hour. That was a big deal when I was a
kid and starting out as a comic. But now
the people just self-produce. They get
Netflix to throw it on. It&#39;s 35 minutes,
40 minutes. That&#39;s like a strong middle
set. It&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you got to do the hour.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think I do. And and then it&#39;s always
like 73. And I got it in my head last
time because I fought for that. you
know, they I said, &#34;Look, cuz when I
enter those things from the road, you
know, a few weeks before, I&#39;m usually
dealing with an hour 45 that I got to
get down to 60 some odd minutes.&#34; And I
told my manager, I said, &#34;Can we go over
the hour?&#34; And they&#39;re like, &#34;They don&#39;t
want to.&#34; And I said, &#34;I&#39;m looking at 73
minutes.&#34; Because the last special was
73. And it&#39;s a weird number, but what
was interesting to me in terms of my
whatever craft I have is that over the
weeks leading up to the special, I
started to take out redundancies. I
started to find through lines. I I added
that line about annoying the average
American into fascism. That happened
like three days before I taped. That
wasn&#39;t in the set. It just came and I
keep it fluid so I can write on that&#39;s
how I generate stuff. A couple things
happened that last week, but I got it
down and I had it in my mind. and it was
73 minutes and we did two tapings that
night in New York and without looking at
the clock they both landed at 73 minutes
and that&#39;s crazy like the the internal
clock is crazy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Some of that is from radio but some of
that is also just from knowing I I don&#39;t
know how to explain it but I guess I&#39;ve
definitely put in my 10,000 hours.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, you&#39;ve definitely done that. You&#39;ve
definitely done that. was I I went like
I I remember you in the Conan days like
I remember watching you on Conan
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I wouldn&#39;t have known you were on
drugs and drinking that like when you
were in those in that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wasn&#39;t like sloppy you know and a lot
of times I I didn&#39;t do it the day of
those shows you you know I don&#39;t think a
lot of people think I was on Coke for
that HBO half hour at the Fillmore in 95
I was just sweaty I don&#39;t think I was on
Coke I do know on my first Comedy
Central half hour I had done Coke the
night before and I didn&#39;t sleep well,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I wasn&#39;t getting jacked to work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You weren&#39;t? You weren&#39;t? No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Cuz even now, like I I forget when
I&#39;m thinking about like I don&#39;t sort you
into the category of oh guys that did a
lot of drinking and coke. Cuz you strike
me as a nerd. You&#39;re like a nerdy guy,
kind of contained Jewish. Like I just I
think of you like that. And even when I
think of you from the Conan days, I
think of you as being like a like not a
party guy. I think of you being a like a
record guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I I think I was like I kind of
rode a line. You know, I grew up in, you
know, towny culture in Albuquerque, but
I was from Jersey and I was very
compelled towards, you know, uh, higher
pursuits. I wanted to really be an
intellectual and but I do have at some
point, you know, a a rock and roll
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was never really a nerd. I was more of
an awkward person, unfocused. I think
nerds are awkward focused people and
they can find community in that. I was
just an uncomfortable guy that knew how
to be funny and and sort of move through
all different clicks and but I was never
that focused and I kind of took to and
still do to a kind of rock and roll
sensibility. So it&#39;s that combination of
that with pretty I think I don&#39;t like
using the word but neurotic anxious
Jewishness. So it&#39;s kind of a hybrid. I
I I think that Randy Newman once told
Lauren Michaels many years ago and
Lauren told Jim Beerman who was
producing me on a show for Broadway
video. It was a streaming show that it
was before streaming though. Uh but
Randy said I was a verbesscent which is
a sour puss.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I kind of I&#39;m okay with that. I was
a cranky guy but I didn&#39;t know quite how
to make it funny. I don&#39;t think I have
the the you know real cranky guys who
are naturally funny. It&#39;s a rare thing,
you know, like Lewis Black is good at
that. I think, you know, Burr at
sometimes just this sort of put upon,
you know, kind of anger that that
doesn&#39;t cross over into intense anger,
which isn&#39;t fundamentally entertaining,
which is where I would go. Uh I think
over time I&#39;ve become a little more
cranky funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s interesting. Why is that? And I
think part of it is for whatever reason
like you you&#39;re there&#39;s a way in which
with like Bill Burr, Lewis Black that
kind you&#39;re rooting for them even when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; populist crank.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. They&#39;re populist and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m a heady guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. You got
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m more of a poet in terms of how my
brain processes things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It never rhyme though. That&#39;s a shame.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it&#39;s all free verse. Occasionally
there&#39;s a rhyme, but I get I take them
right out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You do. There&#39;s a way in which now I
don&#39;t know you seem more like
comfortable as a performer as a standup
which is amazing how how you&#39;ve doing it
for such a long time was it like I know
that like when I was in politics I
remember when I got a job as a speech
writer like I have several chips on my
shoulder a couple of them are still
there but but but but I I&#39;ve seen them
fall off like when I&#39;ve had milestones
like gen and you know you say you can&#39;t
get you you know that outside validation
can&#39;t really change how you feel I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s true I think it absolutely
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; totally
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do you think for you success
has was it financial success acclaim did
those things matter in how you are on
stage did it make you feel comfortable
safer freer what I think that and I&#39;ve
said it before that for a long time
however long it takes you know your
comic&#39;s job is to pretend like they&#39;re
not afraid you know and then eventually
the the fear will leave you and that&#39;s
sort of a big day and I think in terms
of success just the fact that I is able
to build an audience of of grown-up
people mostly, you know, mostly thinky,
creative, you know, disgruntled, you
know, people. You I kind of talk about
in the special, you know, I worry about
alienating them, but there&#39;s also some
part of me that that wants to a little.
Um, but I think that once I got an
audience and I had a freedom of mind,
uh, that I knew would be received that
it did it did help my comedy. Um, and I
guess that&#39;s success, but ultimately I
have been working a long time at this.
And I I think along with that
fearlessness, you know, especially in
this special, it was one of the only
it&#39;s the only special where beforehand I
didn&#39;t let my brain undermine me for for
dumb There&#39;s some part of my brain
that prepares that way. I&#39;ve got to find
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to make me uncomfortable. And it just
didn&#39;t happen.
And I don&#39;t I and I was more grounded in
the special than I ever have been
because I had a I had purpose. Like I
always kind of do, but I I I had a
different purpose both to my audience,
to the way I thought about culture and
politics, and also to the risks I wanted
to take around personal things. Like I a
long time ago, I really set out to not
talk about anything that wasn&#39;t from my
point of view because I could own that
and no one could take it. And anytime
that I&#39;d see similar things, I&#39;d have to
sort of like go, well, is it that
similar? I&#39;ll just lose it. You know, I
don&#39;t I want it to be mine. So the risks
I took in the last two bits around
trauma and around grief were it took a
long time to work those out. So, I just
feel like that I have a confidence in
how I do what I do that is much more
grounded than than it&#39;s ever been. But
yeah, validation is still too important
to me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Who do you want it from?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. My parents.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s always about the parents.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, yeah. I mean because like if you
don&#39;t have a voice in yourself that
you&#39;ve evolved because of being, you
know, emotionally,
you know, manipulated one way or the
other in a negative way by, you know,
your your early experiences. It&#39;s hard
to have a voice in your head that that
says good job.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you don&#39;t have that even now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I do, you know, but I I I still like
I know it, but then when other people
don&#39;t know it as much as I do, it&#39;s it&#39;s
makes me upset.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. like I know that I&#39;m doing the
best work I can and but this special was
you know the last two were very
wellreceived critically by people who
were smart uh in the sense of like
people who assess things not as a
reviewer but as a critic uh and people
got what I was trying to do and many of
them have watched me do it for 25 years.
So when I&#39;m assessed by people who I
respect intellectually, uh even if
there&#39;s a few bad things in there, I I&#39;m
I&#39;m thrilled about it. Isn&#39;t there part
I I find that
that a lot of times when I&#39;m seeking
validation it is in the periods where I
am doing work that I like think is
pretty good but not hitting what I was
in some way or another like not hitting
exactly what I had hoped to hit right
but then I&#39;ll do a show and I&#39;ll think
that was what I wanted to do that was
really great and I want people to agree
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I don&#39;t need it as much when I feel
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I guess like with this one, the
stuff that like I I felt like it was
really the best work that I&#39;ve done in
terms of from like the risks were
different. The last special was about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and you know, at least 20 25 minutes.
And this one was back to sort of almost
a three-act structure, you know, where,
you know, I I do the political cultural
stuff, then I tell them I want to just
be entertaining, and I do that,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then I get into personal stuff, but
I do feel like the stuff that I thought
needed to get out there,
uh, in terms of not the stuff, like you
said before, there&#39;s a lot of stuff in
the special that goes, you know,
undisussed. That&#39;s gnarly and and
deep But, you know, the stuff that
landed I&#39;m okay with because I felt like
there it was not being said,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, in a way that was like no one
can deny my skill set. So, as a comic,
if I&#39;m going to take on what&#39;s going on
in comedy, in relation to culture, and I
do it in a funny way, then I&#39;ve achieved
something because a lot of comics are
scared to talk about it. They they&#39;re
afraid of audiences. And you know, you
just got to really get that ratio into
your head. It was, you know, 75 million
to 77.5 million. It not every room is
full of monsters and certainly not in
LA. And that there has to be some you
have to have the the the the
guts to be a stand-up standup and and
and and say what you want to say. Again,
you know, it&#39;s dicey when you sort of
take on people in your world, but when
it reflects on the world at large in a
negative way, I think it&#39;s it&#39;s ripe.
But to the point like I felt good about
I articulated it well and going into it,
I was 100% confident in in in the set
and and I feel good about it and I I&#39;m
fortunate in that it was received very
well, which is not always the case. So,
I guess technically you&#39;re cusp, but I
think of you as like a quintessential
Gen X.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think so.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, comic
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; last year boomers. So, it&#39;s it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you&#39;re you&#39;re right there. You&#39;re
right. But, but Gen X energy all the way
through right there with the kind of in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the sort of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s probably a little too much you
Led Zeppelin in me to be fully Gen X,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you grunge it up a little, I suppose.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure, I did. Yeah, it was later though.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Later. Yeah. I&#39;d already the groundwork
had been laid by acts from the 70s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But why do we we have had a bunch of
baby boomer presidents?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m not running.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. And and first of all, thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s one less thing to worry
about. Imagine that. That would be
annoying. But uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; just you just you heckling Democrats
back at you just be what a disaster.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. Gavin&#39;s doing that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think he&#39;s more
suited to it honestly than you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh yeah, he wants it pretty bad. I can&#39;t
like I look I know what it&#39;s I know what
it&#39;s like to think you are speaking your
truth and to be completely saturated in
talking points that you don&#39;t know
anymore. I mean I did Air America for a
year every morning and you start to you
realize like I didn&#39;t think this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t remember your show being that
talking pointsy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it&#39;s it&#39;s not but it&#39;s the tone.
Yeah. Yeah. That that you&#39;re honoring uh
narrative. We we seem to have skipped
over Gen X in terms of presidents and
and there&#39;s a sort of a gap in terms
even our representation. We went right
from a lot of boomer members of
Congress. There&#39;s obviously Gen Xers in
there, but we went right from the
boomers to the millennials as well. Why
is it that Gen X hasn&#39;t really shown up?
They&#39;ve also moved to the right uh more
than millennials have. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh what what what happened with what was
something about your generation that
kind of had this sort of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I think it was probably the
beginning of that sort of self-centered
entitlement and need to define yourself
in a unique way
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that was based on, you know, music,
fashion, you know, bits and pieces of,
you know, uh esoteric wisdom from old
books and whatnot. I I think it was
probably, you know, the boomers are are
are selfish in a different way, you
know, because they built the world and
now as they were looking down the tunnel
at death, they kind of want to end it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They want to be buried in their
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, well, they just I think there&#39;s a
part of narcissism that it&#39;s like if the
world ends at the same time they do,
they don&#39;t miss anything. And I think I
think Gen X is probably guilty of a kind
of uh the beginning of of of
like a terminal uniqueness on an
individual level and and not so uh hip
to, you know, real civic community.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; maybe. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m really
spitballing. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really
think in terms of generations that much.
I do know that the boomers are need to
get out of the way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, just I think of like there&#39;s a
there&#39;s a group, you know, I think of
there&#39;s the sort of the Gen X comics. Uh
John Stewart&#39;s in there. You&#39;re in
there. Bill Maher is in that group. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he&#39;s a little older.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is he a little older, buddy?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think he&#39;s kind of solid boomer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You think? Is he only?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, he&#39;s got to be like got to be
close to 70. Somebody
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s get a Bill Mah producer work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 69. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Famously 69. Oh, right. We talked to him
about it. I had him on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s That&#39;s pretty solid boomer
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re right. I take
that back. I take that back. Uh but
Janine, uh you know, John, sure. um you
know some of the other Gen Xers you know
Patton uh and then there&#39;s a bunch of
other you know younger guys the the alt
comedy scene uh for whatever it did was
mostly Gen Xers and some millennials I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they kind of again it was a
insulated community that was based a lot
in kind of snark and you know snark
doesn&#39;t age well because it doesn&#39;t run
that deep. Yeah. And it&#39;s Well, it&#39;s
there&#39;s something about it, too, that&#39;s
that&#39;s um snark. You have to be on the
outside and you have to not want to be
on the inside.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s your answer right there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I think that&#39;s it. There&#39;s
something about there&#39;s something about
Gen X that was like, you know what?
We&#39;re just going to we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be
back here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We&#39;ll be back here with our Zenes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, exactly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that&#39;s it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that was a mistake. I think you
should have guys got in the ring with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m I&#39;m the last boomer. Don&#39;t don&#39;t
blame me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re right. Okay. Okay. You&#39;re right.
I take that back. I take that back. So,
you&#39;re a catastrophizer. I I I I was
because I was thinking about this. I did
I went back and I watched uh parts of
the special from uh um bleak to dark,
dark to bleak.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bleak and dark.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bleak to dark.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you know, I&#39;m a cat catastrophizer
as well. So if I&#39;m on the phone call
with my I&#39;m on the phone with my fiance.
I&#39;m engaged. Second time is what&#39;s going
to take. But the uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How long you been engaged?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like six months.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Six months. You&#39;re planning the wedding?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good. Oh, good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we&#39;re planning the wedding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s not like a sixy year.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, no, no. The last one we didn&#39;t plan
the wedding and I think that that was a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is second marriage.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Second engagement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Second. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There was no first marriage.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I made a lot of changes when I turned
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh-huh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A lot of changes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Like what?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was no longer engaged.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Once I was 40. I I actually never was
single in my 30s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was single when I was 29. I met
somebody. Then the next time I was
single, I was 40.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I forgot to be single in my 30s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And yet you did it again. Well, if I I I
thought it was going to be like when I
was in my 20s. It is not when you&#39;re in
your 40s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A little more work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Yes. You can&#39;t You can&#39;t get my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gone. And I didn&#39;t have a dunk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. The game starts to fade.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s not like when I was in my 20s. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. You felt like you had
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t guessing the right
card. Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know what I mean? I never knew what
what card people had.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I never knew.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this your card? Never right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Never right. And now I&#39;m 40. Yeah. But
you look good. You have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m working. I&#39;m doing
Pilates. Do Pilates?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I do uh I do like kind of a full
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; flexibility workout and then I run a few
days a week. You run
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this morning. I did. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where do you run?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do a hike out in Glendale sometimes
and then other times I just do intervals
on the treadmill at Equinox.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I like Equinox.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m an elitist.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s nice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do Pilates.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s good. done pilates. You do it on
the machine or you just got to do it on
the machine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t feel the benefits as much. I
used to do yoga a lot and I felt like
the benefits in terms of core like I
know there&#39;s something to having your
core engaged upright cuz I know you&#39;re
worried about it too. You&#39;re worried
about the slouch. You got to worry about
the slouch
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Pilates machines don&#39;t satisfy me
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on an endorphin level or on a muscle
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You seem to be aging well. I think
comedians age well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, that is not true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not physically. they become ghouls. But
I&#39;m saying that that mentally some of
the great like comedians that try to
stay curious.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re gonna have to give me an example.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I think I think uh uh comedians
that have that have tried to stay kind
of sharp and curious about the world. I
think you&#39;re one of them. There&#39;s got to
be a couple more.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s a
faulty premise, but but you said it
confidently. I I I think that I
well like look uh uh like I think
Seinfeld is somebody that&#39;s keep trying
to do new material and I don&#39;t do like
you can like or dislike what Seinfeld
does but but even you can but even great
but even the other day like he he gave
some answer about woke stuff and it got
some blowback and he actually came back
and he said you know what I was wrong
about that and he actually gave a really
good answer. He thought about it. He
came back and he said, &#34;You know what?
Uh I what I said was stupid and actually
uh if the if the goalpost move, I should
hit the goalpost. That&#39;s my job.&#34; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I thought that was cool.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that what happened with Jerry
ultimately is that he was really a guy
that didn&#39;t speak much publicly. And
then, you know, not just because of the
advent of podcasting and the the needs
of the new publicity environment, all of
a sudden Jerry was never shutting up. So
everybody saw Jerry for Jerry. And you
do with that what you will.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. I&#39;ll do with it what I will.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m glad he apologized and you feel good
about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Who else? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s do
some more beefs. What do you think about
Bill Maher?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can&#39;t I can&#39;t do it. You know, I can&#39;t
you know. I don&#39;t tone. I always had a
problem with his tone. I think I did I
did politically correct years ago.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I&#39;m sure you did.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A couple of times maybe. And I think I
did real time maybe once or twice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But I don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You were dating Anne Coulter at the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. That was a dark time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I tried to help her.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there&#39;s no She&#39;s lost cause. I couldn&#39;t
do it. There&#39;s nothing I could do
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with all my years of experience in and
out of bed that could help her.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, uh no, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. Like I
feel with Bill that there is this and it
happens with some of the other boomers.
There&#39;s this desperate chasing of
relevance that, you know, changes
someone&#39;s mind uh in terms of how they
approach what they do and and and and
also kind of makes the whole undertaking
feel desperate and uh you know outside
of you know his ideas about primarily I
think wokeness
um uh I don&#39;t know it it it&#39;s It&#39;s just
not for me. I know his joke write, you
know, he&#39;s got good joke writers who
know how to write for his tone and I&#39;ve
known a couple of those guys. They were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and they&#39;re good guys, but I I can&#39;t I
can&#39;t see past, you know, the
desperation what he&#39;s willing to do to
stay in the conversation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what do you think about the death of
like you Late Show&#39;s gone, Conan Show&#39;s
obviously gone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sort of it&#39;s the it&#39;s it it&#39;s coming
undone. this this place that I know I&#39;m
sure for you was this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pinnacle of where comics went, what
comedy was like from Carson to Letterman
to come. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh what do you think of that? I I think
it&#39;s just the nature of what we talked
about before is that if the bar has been
lowered to consuming only clips, you
know, which is dictated by media
platforms that this whole idea of like,
you know, algorithms and what people&#39;s
attention span can and can&#39;t do is it&#39;s
sort of a I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a
catch22, but it it&#39;s like even with any
streamer you work on, it&#39;s like, well,
our algorithm says people can&#39;t pay
attention for this long. I&#39;m like, but
not my people. And if you keep promoting
that, they won&#39;t. I mean, if something
is good, they&#39;ll they&#39;ll stay in it. I
guess the format and the nature of show
business has just again shifted to
entrepreneurs and and uh you know, media
bubbles that are are self-driven by you
know, individuals or tribal entities.
and that the whole the whole framing of
show business being this, you know, it&#39;s
the talk show. Here come the
celebrities. It&#39;s just people don&#39;t care
anymore and they&#39;re all chasing uh
clicks on, you know, for clips of, you
know, having interesting people do dumb
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we&#39;re going to bring those pies in
in a second, but the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, god damn it. I knew there was a big
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh the No, I want to end with this. It&#39;s
it&#39;s a serious question and it&#39;s where I
was going to before, but but look, when
I&#39;m on the phone with uh Ari and the
phone cuts out, I think they&#39;re dead.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just assume the building has
collapsed. Truly like earthquake, a 911.
Truly, I if they&#39;re in New York, I think
a 911 has happened. Like I really go
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh takes a lot a lot to adjust to the
text just ending without a buy,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s just like the last thing said is
just hanging there. There&#39;s you know
Fahheim Anoir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So funny. He&#39;s a very funny younger
comic and he just does this this this
dating, you know, he was texting with
somebody he met on a dating app and he
was trying to he didn&#39;t know whether he
was being ghosted or not or or No, he
you know, he made a joke, she said
something and he just, you know, texted
the dancing emoji and nothing nothing.
That was all that was left. That was the
last thing he said forever. Exact
forever. It&#39;s there&#39;s no way to end a
text conversation. It&#39;s a terrible
medium. But uh it&#39;s actually social
media. We don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; curt with text.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We don&#39;t think Me too. We don&#39;t think of
texting as social media. It&#39;s a form of
social media because it&#39;s an impression
of of talking to somebody. You&#39;re not
actually talking to somebody. But that
we can&#39;t talk about that anymore. We we
have we have no time for this. Here was
my question for you which is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh you&#39;re a catastrophizer. You&#39;ve done
it your whole life. And you know you&#39;ve
been through a terrible loss. Your plane
hit the mountain.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Did it change how you view catastrophe?
Does it change how you allow your mind
to create catastrophe all the time?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it what it changed was my sense of
mortality. It it did not change like it
doesn&#39;t, you know, tragic loss of
somebody you love. That&#39;s not my go-to
catastrophe. I didn&#39;t see that coming at
all. I mean, my parents are both still
alive. You know, it&#39;s not great, but uh
but I didn&#39;t see what happened to Lynn.
There was no way I could have ever seen
that coming. So, you know, when somebody
dies tragically, you know, all the other
catastrophizing about me and cancer or,
you know, what someone&#39;s going to say
about me or the world or the fires or or
anything else when somebody dies, it
does make me more scared in in
relationship because it&#39;s happened. But
it also sort of makes you realize just
how fragile it all is and how there is
no real kind of universal order to it.
And you know, there&#39;s no way to to
answer the question why. And that that&#39;s
just life. So I I don&#39;t it didn&#39;t
diminish my catastrophizing, but it it
did make me realize how fragile life is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I think too heavy for an answer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I just think now we&#39;re ready to
start. Let&#39;s record.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, good. Let&#39;s get the things going. We
got warmed up
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and now we&#39;re hour in it. Uh Mark Marin,
good to have you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. Nice to be here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good to see you. This is great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that&#39;s all for today. Thank you to
Mark Marin for stopping by. We&#39;ll be
back in your podcast feeds on Tuesday
with a new episode from me, John, and
Tommy. Have a have a great rest of your
weekend or if it&#39;s Monday, I don&#39;t know.
