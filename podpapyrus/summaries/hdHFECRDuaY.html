You were you 17 when
No, we you know what? We never got time
to celebrate. That was the one thing in
One Direction that I always hated. And
so I mean I started to celebrate really
early into um into award shows. I&#39;d like
I&#39;d made sure I had a good time when I
was there cuz I knew I was going to be
on a plane to Japan and like sleeping on
the floor. We we used to have really big
security guards and like I literally
have slept like 14 hours on the floor to
Japan before and woke up on the floor
and then like been greeted by 6,000
So crazy then. And it&#39;s not that you
want to beat your brand because no one
will beat our One Direction. Not one of
us in our lifetimes. In another
lifetime, somebody might. But we were
like the new wave of the Beatles. And
even still, people didn&#39;t say we beat
the Beatles.
You know what I mean? You&#39;re never going
to different era.
Exactly. And that&#39;s that&#39;s what happened
with our fate as well. We were just that
of this era. The one of the biggest
accolades I ever remember of ours was
having the the the
biggest selling tour in the world for
three years in a row.
Yeah. And everywhere we used to go, we
used to beat the the the records in the
venue, the records this, you know. So,
you know what? You didn&#39;t even look at
that when you&#39;re in One Direction. It
was really weird actually until it
finished. And like I remember being on
the phone to Lou after and being like,
&#34;Wow, like that was really something.&#34;
As the band kind of stopped and we had a
number of months off. It was almost like
going through some like weird early
retirement. Find yourself, especially
after the band, you know, we we we were
so used to being together and being
known, you know, people still call me
One Direction in the street. It&#39;s like
it&#39;s your name. To
be fair, no, I think I I think it would
be weird to be a solo artist. I mean, I
look at people like Justin Timberlake
and and like Robbie Williams or where
I&#39;m from. I saw a show of his the other
day and just thinking like how they&#39;ve
managed to achieve success on top of the
the the success they already had. Like
NSync were huge, but then Justin
Timberlake has managed to build on that
somehow, but I don&#39;t really know how it
how it would work. It kind of scares me
a little bit to be honest with you. So,
I don&#39;t know. I like having, you know,
the comfort of the other lads on stage
and stuff and the vibe you can have and
there&#39;s always someone to chat to rather
than just being on your own. You know
what I mean? It&#39;s like
sure, you know, it&#39;s tough out there
singing these songs on your own. Some of
them are really difficult. There&#39;s a
reason there was four/5 people there to
overtake sometimes.
So when I, you know, when I often think
about somebody like Justin Bieber who
kind of went through his whole level of
fame by himself, he had no one else who
knew what it was like to be Justin
Bieber, which I think&#39;s, you know, kind
of hard. So I tend to give him a little
bit of a break sometimes.
Um, whereas, you know, for us, we had
each other and we all knew what it felt
like to be in One Direction. And it
still feels that way today.
One of our old managers went to therapy
from being a manager of One Direction.
So, we can imagine how that feels.
Like the rest of us definitely need
some. And for me, most part I was really
regressing from therapy because everyone
was pushing me into it, which is the
worst thing you can do. You you leave
fame the age you entered it. So, for me,
that was 14, right? So, I&#39;m screwed.
Like, I&#39;m the 14year-old forever child.
So that was always a big fear of mine
that I have to grow properly. We were
17. I thought the security guard was
like in charge of me. Like I was like,
&#34;Oh, can we leave the room?&#34; No. Okay,
then not to worry. I&#39;ll just stay here.
That&#39;s what it was like. So I didn&#39;t
know what the hell I was doing. You know
what I mean? It&#39;s like and and no one
there&#39;s no guide book. They don&#39;t give
you a little DVD on the way in saying
here you&#39;re a pop star. Like this is
what you got to do. So I&#39;m like in the
room like what are we allowed to leave?
And then eventually that becomes like an
angry person. And I was
because there was points where it was
toxic and it was difficult. Don&#39;t get me
wrong, we had the best time ever. We
did. But there was moments where
through, you know, I mean, there&#39;s a
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a big movement on it
at the moment and people overwork and
and like you don&#39;t realize you have a
choice at that point,
but in those shows sometimes they don&#39;t
give you the choice because you want the
dream, but you have to realize there is
a sacrifice for that. So every young kid
coming into this business, as soon as I
meet them, I&#39;m like, look, if you want
to call me, I&#39;m not trying to like put
ownership over you that I know more than
you or any of that kind of crap. All I&#39;m
saying is if something happens like call
me and any help I can give you I will
give you but if I can&#39;t then I&#39;ll let
you I&#39;ll find somebody who can
basically. So it&#39;s like you know trying
to help each other because we&#39;re all
we&#39;re all we&#39;re all not I don&#39;t want to
say suffering from the same disease. It
makes it sound very like sad and
horrible and like oh whatever but it is
we all have this thing about us that we
have to we have to live with that&#39;s part
of of fame and I think it&#39;s better if we
all stick together than start you know
throwing the visa at each other. My
life&#39;s been so controlled to a point day
sheets, security guards, you know,
anything. And it&#39;s all everybody else is
dictating puppet master crap over the
top of your life.
Then then you just get to point where
it&#39;s like you have to take some control
by yourself. And until I started to do
that with my life, then I was living for
everybody else and I&#39;m a complete people
pleaser anyway. So it was like nothing
in my life was about serving myself,
which then that just left me in a bad
place and finding enjoyment from other
stuff that I don&#39;t need.
But but for you when you got into the
band, was it what you expected it to be?
Because you said you&#39;ve you have said
that that there were times you just I
just have to get out. I have to stop.
This is driving me.
No, I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely been a
crazy wild, you know, everyone&#39;s kind of
looking at this decades and my decade&#39;s
lally been this, which has been the
maddest turnaround of all. Um and it&#39;s a
really weird thing to to to look into.
But no, I I don&#39;t think any of us really
expected to it to happen in that in that
way. Really,
the biggest thing to ever come out of of
X Factor was a bank called JLS and they
were very big in the UK.
So when we got where we got to, I
thought, &#34;Oh, we&#39;ll be just like JLS,
like we&#39;ll be big in the UK.&#34; And then
like we started closing down streets in
the UK and like one one little girl like
broke a leg by crossing the road and not
they would close down streets. I
thought, &#34;Okay, this is getting a little
bit strange. I&#39;m like 16 years old,
right?&#34; So I thought, &#34;I know what I&#39;ll
do. if it gets too big, I&#39;ll move to
Australia. And then the very next day
after XA, right, you&#39;re going to
Australia. And my name had already beat
me there. And that&#39;s when I knew I was
oh, okay, this is where we&#39;re going to
go next. Like,
no, where&#39;s the escape button? There&#39;s
no, you know,
do you miss the anonymity, though? Do
you ever wish you could go back just for
a couple of days and play to a crowd of
10 people, or are you okay with the fact
that this is where your life&#39;s at right
No, to be fair, I love it. I can&#39;t
believe, you know, we&#39;re about to, you
know, step foot on our stadium tour next
year and stuff and that&#39;s so crazy. Like
we drove past Wembley, which is like at
our biggest stadium in our country the
other day, knowing that we&#39;ve sold out
three times. It&#39;s just like you&#39;d never
ever have expected that to happen. Like,
you know, you&#39;d expect to play some
shows here and there, but not like at
90,000 strong stadium is just crazy. The
problem we had in the band, and I don&#39;t
blame anybody for this. I don&#39;t want to
seem like I&#39;m whining or moaning, oh my
god, look at my life. Whatever. But it
feels to me like when we were in the
band, the best way to secure us because
of how big it got was just lock us in
our rooms. And of course, what&#39;s in the
room? Mini bar.
So, at a certain point, I thought, well,
I&#39;m going to have a party for one. And
that just seemed to carry on throughout
many years of my life. And then you look
back how long you&#39;ve been drinking and
stuff, you&#39;re like, Jesus Christ, that&#39;s
a long time. Uh, I don&#39;t know. I it&#39;s I
think there&#39;s there&#39;s a slight little
bit of social anxiety as well in it that
you know it was already hard sometimes
to go out places for the thought that
you might like
papped or whatever you know there&#39;s
always that extra level of stress so for
me I&#39;ve always been quite withdrawn
time and what I find about my life now
is I&#39;m still in a syndrome sometimes
where I become like almost in a way
because I wait for work to tell me where
to go
as wild but it was like the only way you
could get frustration out in the day or
being in like trapped and and you I
spoke about to somebody about this and
and and in child development, you know,
as a team, the one thing you need is is
freedom to make choices and freedom to
do stuff and it was the one thing that
although we could do anything we wanted,
it seemed from the outside that we were
always locked in a room at night and
then it would be car, hotel room, stage,
sing locked. M.
So it was like they pull the dust cloth
off, let us out for a minute and then
woohoo. And then he&#39;s like back
underneath here and I&#39;m like
And you had therapy.
Yes. I went through a number of
different bits of therapy and whatever
else. I think, you know, as Strip That
Down was coming out, I was almost just
as afraid of the success as I was the
failure. Um, which isn&#39;t a really very
comfortable place to be in life cuz
you&#39;re just not really sure what you&#39;re
doing. You know what I mean? It was just
it was one of those sorts of things. So
I went away. Um I had a little bit of a
thing with drink. Um and it was um a guy
called Chip Summers who got me sober. I
went sober for a year.
We were talking before two whisies.
Such a bad idea. Maybe.
No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a great idea. When&#39;s
it ever a bad idea? It&#39;s a bad idea. The
next day.
Don&#39;t tell them what time it is. That
makes it seem like absolute My bad.
And stopping drinking for a year. Was
that something that you plan to do for
longer or did you just know actually I
just need to sort of push reset a little
bit? Yeah, for me I think I was just at
a point in my life where I was too young
to to stop and and you know in a way it
turned my my social life upside down as
well. So it was a very lonely experience
as well as it was that many things in my
life went up but also a lot of things in
my life went down at the same time. So
it was a super lonely atmosphere
whenever you get home cuz you lose a lot
of different friends and whatever else.
I was like in this amazing penthouse
that I that I I owned. I was still sad
and I was like a everything I ever
wanted but it&#39;s nothing I&#39;ll ever need.
You know, for me it was just about
pressing that reset button for a minute
and realizing you could, you know, cope
without it and learn and and learning
about emotions. You know, we have to
mask our emotions in so many different
ways. And I think it&#39;s very important
that you learn to deal with emotion as
well. And as raw as it is, that you know
you&#39;re going to be all right. When was
the last time you turned up to work hung
over rehearsals? Well, I actually didn&#39;t
make them, so I didn&#39;t technically turn
up, but when was the last time you
didn&#39;t remember a night out? I went to
IB the other day. Don&#39;t remember a
thing. What did you do to work on those
demons that you were facing for so long?
Um, they&#39;re probably right behind me,
but they&#39;re still bit still a bit away.
Yeah, they&#39;re catching up a little bit
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] One of the one days that stuck
out for me in the last few years where I
did a whole day&#39;s promo in New York and
on the nighttime I was on I think it&#39;s
Andy Cohen show or something and they
had a drinking game
and someone asked me a question about
one of my ex-girlfriends and I did not
want to divulge what the hell went down.
In early 2019, there were rumors that
linked you with supermodel Naomi
Campbell, especially after you were
spotted at the O2 together in January,
and you were leaving sexy comments on
each other&#39;s Instagram pages. Liam, can
you confirm or deny that you dated
Pleaded the fifth.
You plead the fifth.
He confirmed it.
I pled the fifth. Okay. It&#39;s my rights
as a human.
And it was a drinking game. So I I was
like they were like we can fill it with
water. But me being me was like no if
I&#39;m playing I&#39;m playing for real. So I&#39;m
like necking tequila.
Oh gosh.
Like boom. And I&#39;m wasted. I get home at
1. Bear in mind I started at like I want
to say 8:00 in the morning. I was then
asleep and I woke up at 3 for vocal
training to be in Central Park at 7 for
grooming at 5:00 and in Central Park for
7:00. Bear in mind I went to bed at half
1. So I know what it can bring and that
that crap will send you insane. I don&#39;t
remember. Some days I was here.
And are you still drinking or have you?
No. No. Not soon.
No. No. No. I mean, so just over a month
now, I think it is. There&#39;s there&#39;s some
stuff that I&#39;ve definitely like never
never spoken about to do with it that
was really really really severe. And it
was a problem. And and and it was only
until I saw myself after that I was
like, &#34;Right, I need to fix myself.&#34;
It was like a few pictures of me on a
boat and I&#39;m all like bloating out. And
I call it pills and booze face. And I
was like this. It&#39;s like my face was
just like 10 times more than it is now.
And uh I just didn&#39;t like myself very
much. Then I made a change. And the same
thing happened this year with with with
that sort of thing as well. I had to go
out and uh I went to Dubai which was the
best thing I ever did. It was at a Han
Zimmer concert with a friend of mine
called Umar that I had had my last drink
and he was sober and I&#39;d kind of been
watching him for a week. He&#39;s a
fantastic businessman, wonderful soul
and one of the most generous human
beings I think I&#39;ve ever come across.
And what kind of happened was I was
watching this beautiful symphony. I was
having a drink and then I was like, you
know what? This just isn&#39;t serving me at
all. I don&#39;t really need this right now.
It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever put a
drink down and gone to someone, yeah,
you finish that. I don&#39;t need it. And I
haven&#39;t picked one up since, which has
almost been 6 months, which I&#39;m excited
about. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s good to be in
this position. And then, yeah, I
definitely don&#39;t need those things
I think don&#39;t. It&#39;s a really fine line
between getting too wrapped up in what&#39;s
going on and not being wrapped up enough
in it, if you know what I mean. But I
think you I think you know the things
that hurt you the most because you know
they&#39;re honest. So when someone says
something you like if they hurt you then
it hurt you a lot then you know there&#39;s
some truth in it because it hurt you. If
it&#39;s ridiculous you just go that was
funny as if they said that.
Yeah. I I love just joking around and
honestly for me watching the commotion
is one of the funniest things about it.
Just seeing the reaction.
A lot of people are under the impression
that I really give a crap about that
sort of stuff but it doesn&#39;t really you
know I just I just get on with it. It&#39;s
just a bit of fun for me.
There&#39;s a fine line to tread with it.
And I mean, I&#39;ve gone through eras where
I was such like a little clapback
where as soon as someone would say
something, I&#39;d be like, &#34;Right, well
then let&#39;s go at you.&#34; And then I was I
mean, I was a bit mean and nasty at
points actually. It was a bit bad. But
when you&#39;re a teen growing up in it and
people are like basically bullying you
and they get paid for it, it&#39;s like
that&#39;s a bit outrageous. So, I&#39;m going
to have my say.
Who&#39;s got the biggest mountain? You know
what I mean? But then it&#39;s like someone
said to me over time, it&#39;s like, you
know, if someone says something about me
in the press in this country and then I
say something about them, it ends up on
E-News and then they&#39;ve made America. I
didn&#39;t get anywhere.
Cuz like a lot of people if I tweet
about or tweet about someone, their
phone just like breaks for the day. Next
level. I honestly I&#39;ve never seen
anything quite like it. And I wonder how
it is for your girlfriend. How does she
handle your very serious intense One
Direction fans?
Um I don&#39;t know. Sometimes I think it&#39;s
kind of hard for her because the there&#39;s
a lot Well, I think that lately for me
Twitter&#39;s been a bit twisted sometimes
and some horrible things get said. Like
I had I had somebody on there the other
day who was pretending to be her that
had tweeted that my mom had died which
is just weird.
What are they? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s so
strange. But I don&#39;t know. She I don&#39;t
think she really looks at it too much to
be fair because well I kind of told her
not to anyways release right and I was
getting a lot of hate online. There was
death threats. It was all sorts of
stuff. My biggest worry was actually
stepping off the team bus that day
because I was I was initially sure I was
going to get booed. I never really been
in that position with you guys before. I
kind of ruined that moment for myself to
be honest with you. I just kind of got
through the game at that point because
it wasn&#39;t really about me. Let&#39;s be
People getting into you every day,
getting into you every day. Like I say,
it just every so often you&#39;re like, when
will this end, you know? And then
certain that&#39;s that&#39;s almost killed me a
couple of times.
And like I told you earlier, the moment
the moment for me is never about me when
we&#39;re talking or if there&#39;s a fan that
wants a picture or somebody wants to
come over. The moment&#39;s about them
having their five minutes.
So, whoever they want me to be for that
5 minutes, I&#39;ll be, you know, and it&#39;s
always about impressing whoever&#39;s behind
the lens or whoever whoever&#39;s in the
So, I find I&#39;ll fill conversations with
crap that I&#39;m saying that doesn&#39;t really
help me cuz I&#39;ll go home and thinking,
&#34;Why the hell did I say that? What? Now
I&#39;m that guy? Oh my god.&#34; You know,
and then and then it&#39;s like, but I was
saying it because I thought it would
entertain the other person. It wasn&#39;t
about me.
I still don&#39;t know who I am. I replicate
different people on a daily basis. Like
I I still don&#39;t know who I am. That&#39;s
the worst part of it because it&#39;s like
selling an identity to people that I I&#39;m
me. So I can only sell me. And then the
different thing was I&#39;d gone out of the
writing zone. I don&#39;t want to say why,
but I&#39;d stopped writing in that sense.
And it was more difficult to write for
my own project because I was like trying
to pull from my own life, which is also
very vastly confusable. Like I feel like
I hide resentments from people
sometimes. And I&#39;m like, something
annoys me and I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, no, no,
it&#39;s fine.&#34; But inside thinking,
&#34;Jesus Christ, I wish she didn&#39;t do
that.&#34; So then it&#39;s like, then over time
I&#39;m like, every little thing starts
creeping in.
Never allowed to say anything. Nobody
wanted to tarnish the image of whatever
the hell was going on in the thing. So
trying to hide a bunch of stuff bleeds
over into your normal life as well as it
does you playing whatever character is
you play as a celebrity or a performer
or whatever. So sometimes you can get
lost in the connection part of this
game. And I think that&#39;s always been a
difficult thing for me to connect with
people cuz I put so many barriers up
before you get to actually what&#39;s going
that you you know it&#39;s almost like
hurdling in a way.
Why do you think those barriers are up?
Protection. I think it&#39;s protecting
people from what&#39;s you know if you turn
up in the disguise every time then you
can always blame it on the disguise. The
moment you&#39;re not wearing one you got
nothing to blame it on.
I&#39;m a proper perfectionist. Terrible.
Terrible. Terrible. So, when it comes
down to relationships, I&#39;m always trying
to at the start of the relationship, as
we all do, you put out this complete
false character.
Like, I might as well go in in costume
at this point. I&#39;m like putting out
something that is not there. That&#39;s my
biggest problem I feel for for myself. I
don&#39;t lay out my store. I&#39;m like willing
to bend to someone else&#39;s store and then
I&#39;m annoyed at why they don&#39;t like what
I like.
I think other people just want their
space. And also, you know, we worked
together for 5 years. For some of us, we
didn&#39;t really have that much in common
except for that we had a job together.
Now, we don&#39;t have that job together any
longer. There&#39;s not really a real reason
for us to talk that often. I think
everyone&#39;s settling into themselves at
this point. I know I am for sure. Um,
uh, I had a lovely phone call from Harry
the other day who was checking in on me
and I it&#39;s almost like some people have
got six sense of you, right, that you&#39;re
going through something so they&#39;ll check
in and he was he&#39;s very much like that.
He&#39;s a lovely lovely boy. I I love him
to pieces. And then um, Louie I I speak
to a lot. I mean, I speak a lot to
Louis, who&#39;s obviously, you know, he&#39;s
had a crazy uh few years more so than
anyone. You know, very a very sad few
years for him, actually. Um, but he&#39;s
been he&#39;s doing amazing. You know, I
he&#39;s transformed him into the into the
most beautiful human being ever. Things
I would say Lou is the one that I turn
to the most. I think when we were in the
band, if there was ever like a problem
bandwise, me and him would always try
and figure it out together. So, we often
do that through life now as well, which
is good. The rest of the boys have
really stood by me and when when I
needed them most, they, you know, kind
of came to the rescue. Even Zayn as
well, which is why, you know, I did send
him a little thank you online. Actually,
for each of us as members, we wanted to
see what we could do. And I, you know,
I&#39;m really happy with my success of ASP.
What I don&#39;t know is
how how much of this idea was was was
mine to go with as to be in the music
career, but I think it&#39;s all fairly like
it&#39;s laid out as it is now, and we&#39;ve
all had our success in completely
different areas. And also musically, we
didn&#39;t really go down the same route. I
think Harry
Harry&#39;s done amazing, you know? I mean,
first album he had the one song off,
which is really, really well, and then
his second album, he found himself. And
that&#39;s that is your awakening as artist.
That&#39;s when it really clicks. I don&#39;t
feel like I&#39;ve had that moment within me
yet. I&#39;ve written some songs recently
that I&#39;m really proud of and happy with,
but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve had that
moment. Can we get Harry Styles, Louis
Thomas, and Liam Payne, and no, and say
about it for a collab this year? Um,
honestly, I don&#39;t know where half of
them are. Um, I imagine if we scream
loud enough, it&#39;ll be like Avengers
Assemble and everyone will just mosy. Is
anyone behind that curtain?
I would I would enjoy a collab. That
would be fun. I mean, at the moment, we
seem to just get asked all the time if
we are getting are you getting back
together, aren&#39;t you getting back
together? The truth is I think it&#39;s a
matter of when. At the moment,
everyone&#39;s super comfortable doing their
own thing and everyone&#39;s really happy
doing their solo stuff. You know, I&#39;m
really enjoying this at the moment. I&#39;ve
had great success doing this at the
moment, which has been really, really
fun. And it&#39;s great to watch everybody
else venturing out and doing their own
thing. So I I mean it&#39;s more to do with
where some other people in the band&#39;s
heads are at with it to be honest with
you. So
I I&#39;ll say it cuz he brought it up quite
recently, but you know the whole thing
to talk about the reunion like for me
I&#39;d rather be talked about it sooner
rather than later cuz I don&#39;t want to
it&#39;s tough touring touring that that
that sort of a record and and I enjoyed
touring for what I enjoyed it for but
there&#39;s parts of it that really really
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] me up man in a sense. I&#39;ll be
honest with you. Um, but none of us talk
about it. It&#39;s like it&#39;s taboo subject
like, &#34;Oh, we can&#39;t get back together.&#34;
What do you mean? Oh my god. Like us in
the same room. What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is that
about? Yeah. So, once you reach that
height, I suppose one of the reasons I
struggled the most out of it is because
you&#39;re never really going to reach that
height again. And then it&#39;s almost like
uh limbo
and also not knowing whether or not
we&#39;re going to come back. Are we going
to come back? Everyone&#39;s asking. And it
feels like pressure to come back. It&#39;s
almost like your your parents going,
&#34;When&#39;s baby two coming?&#34; You know what
I mean? It&#39;s like, &#34;Oh my god, now we
got to have another one.&#34;
So, That&#39;s that&#39;s wild to me. And and
and and having to deal with that at a
young age. I was I was always going to
mess it up somewhere
is what I would say about myself because
that&#39;s like he says the worst day ever.
You know, the day the band ended, I was
like, &#34;Thank Lord for that.&#34; And I know
a lot of people are going to be mad at
me for saying that, but I needed to stop
or it would kill me.
Um and I was like, &#34;Thank the Lord.&#34; And
then after that trying to like funnel
your way back into society, be like,
&#34;Hey guys, I&#39;m still here turning up at
Is there was there is there a moment
where you look back and say that was the
lowest moment for me? That was the
pivotal moment.
A few of them. I was worried how far my
rock bottom was going to be. Where&#39;s
rock bottom for me? And you would never
have seen it. I&#39;m very good at hiding
it. No one would have ever seen it. But
rock bottom it
I I mean I don&#39;t even know if I hit it
yet. I can either make that choice now
and and pick my last moment as my rock
at the bottom or I can make a new one
and make a whole new low as my choice,
you know, and then so that that&#39;s that&#39;s
almost nearly killed me a couple of
as a place.
Yeah. When I&#39;ve been in a bad place,
100%, you know, there&#39;s no point denying
it. It&#39;s definitely it&#39;s definitely been
on the menu a couple of times in my
life. And uh
this is enough. I don&#39;t want to be here
Yeah, 100% man. everyone else is trying
to help and you don&#39;t see the effect
it&#39;s having on them as well.
You live and die by the sword. I live
and die by my sword. That&#39;s it. But the
person who&#39;s behind trying to pick up
the shield to help me,
they haven&#39;t even got the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sword.
They&#39;re just diving into battle for you.
And that&#39;s the difference. You know what
I mean? It&#39;s like people miss out on
that bit. So, it&#39;s never
just on that person. You know what I
mean? A lot of my stuff, you know, if I
hadn&#39;t had the help I had, I I don&#39;t
know where the hell I&#39;d be right now.
Just really great people around you and
just finding out a different way of
looking at it. Like you say, you know,
when things start to pile on top of each
other, that&#39;s when it can really get
you. You&#39;ve really got to change your
view about it. There&#39;s only one thing
you control within that situation. It is
you. I feel like more than anything at
this point, I&#39;m more disappointed in
myself for the keep on hurting people.
