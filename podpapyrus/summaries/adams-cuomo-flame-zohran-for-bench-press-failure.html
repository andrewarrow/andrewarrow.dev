<li>A socialist politician in New York attempted to bench press 135 pounds at a men's day event in Brooklyn, with the spotter holding the bar the entire time</li>
<li>The bench press attempt went viral and became politically controversial, with critics saying he didn't actually complete the lift independently</li>

<li>Andrew Cuomo also criticized the politician, saying "this guy can't bench his own body weight, let alone carry the weight of leading the most important city"</li>
<li>The incident has become part of a pattern of finding "silly scandals" for the politician, including attacks based on DSA platform positions he didn't personally endorse</li>
<li>Former congressman Jamal Bowman, who can bench press 400 pounds, is mentioned as a supporter of the politician</li>
<li>A new corruption scandal emerged involving Eric Adams' campaign worker who tried to bribe a reporter with cash hidden in a bag of chips</li>
<li>The campaign worker handed a reporter chips containing a red envelope with at least $140 in cash, claiming it was a "culture thing" when confronted</li>
<li>When asked about the bribery allegations, Eric Adams downplayed his relationship with the worker, saying he only greets her with "nihao"</li>
<li>The New York Times admitted their reporters had also witnessed cash exchanges from the Adams campaign but hadn't reported it previously</li>
<li>Cash bribes are considered unusually brazen corruption, as most political corruption involves "soft" benefits like free meals or travel</li>
<li>The socialist politician responded to the corruption scandal by organizing a citywide scavenger hunt as a tongue-in-cheek reference</li>
<li>The scavenger hunt announcement featured the politician holding the same type of chip bag used in the bribery attempt</li>
<li>Thousands of people participated in the scavenger hunt across New York City</li>
<li>The scavenger hunt was described as both "millennial cringe" and a positive way to get people outside and exploring the city</li>
<li>Eric Adams has multiple aids under investigation or indicted, representing "old school" big city machine-level corruption</li>
<li>The campaign worker involved in the bribery had previously been under FBI investigation</li>

Moving on to that&#39;s a good segue to our
to our socialist uh friend up in New
York. So, he&#39;s catching a lot of heat
for this particular video of um him I
guess this was something called men&#39;s
day in Brooklyn and in Brooklyn
where they had all the like
weightlifting stuff out and bunch of
guys bench pressing etc on the sidewalk.
So, they convince him to come in and uh
and give his go at this is apparently
135 pounds that he is attempting to
bench press here. Let&#39;s take a look.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is how you move up in the pole.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go.
Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Let me get one more. Let me get
Let me get three. Let me get three. Let
me get three.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I look at that. I&#39;m like, everybody&#39;s
having a good time. What&#39;s the problem?
But this became a whole thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unfortunately, in amongst fit bros, he&#39;s
getting by. I am not a fit bro. I am
simply an observer. Uh yeah, I would
never claim that&#39;s stolen
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; noticer. That it&#39;s a it&#39;s stolen valor.
Uh but anyway, I&#39;m aware of the
discourse in the fitness community and
he&#39;s getting ripped. He&#39;s getting ripped
apart. Now, I did ask my trainer and my
trainer says it&#39;s unfair because they
didn&#39;t really give him a chance. So, we
didn&#39;t fully get to see whether he could
actually do it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For people who are just listening, the
spotter is holding the bar the whole
time the entire time. And so, he doesn&#39;t
fail, but he also doesn&#39;t really try
like because the spotter is holding the
bar the whole time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Exactly. So, look, I mean, at the
same time, politically, it hasn&#39;t ended
up well, at least for him yet. Uh, Eric
Adams and a lot of others are
capitalizing on this. Here we have Eric
Adams. I&#39;ll just put this on the screen.
He says, quote, &#34;A lifetime of hard work
versus a silver spoon. The results speak
for themselves. The weight of the job is
too heavy for mom scrani. The only thing
he can lift is your taxes.&#34; Uh, and I
believe uh Andrew Kuomo has weighed in
as well. D3, please. Let&#39;s put it up
there on the screen. What have we got?
Uh, Andrew Kuomo, it&#39;s easy to talk.
It&#39;s hard to carry the burden. This guy
can&#39;t bench his own body weight, let
alone carry the weight of leading the
most important city in the world. I
actually do want to know how much Cuomo
can bench. Um because if you&#39;ll
remember, his nipples were often very
prominent shirts uh during co you know,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; remember that comment that Trump made?
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, he was
right. You know, he&#39;s right and nipples
protruding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it&#39;s true. It&#39;s gross. All right.
It&#39;s gross. Put a damn, you know, put a
jacket on, man, if that&#39;s your physique.
Uh anyway, this is this has gone quite
viral uh for Mr. Zoron. So anyway, I am
curious. I do want to know what CLO can
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and whether Adams is on TRT because 64
lifting a lot. I mean, I&#39;m skeptical
personally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s a whole dynamic in this campaign
that&#39;s also like a meme of um them
trying to like come up with the silliest
scandals for Zoron. Like there was that
whole remember thing about like his
college admissions and the box he
checked and whatever, all that sort of
stuff. Or the other thing that like the
New York Post loves to do is they love
to pull the DSA platform and like find
something in that and be like Zoron
supports this even even when he didn&#39;t
say anything.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I literally just fell for that. It was
the headline was like Zoron wants to get
rid of misdemeanor and I was like man
what an idiot and I started reading it
and I was like wait this is the DSA
platform. I was like it&#39;s not the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He didn&#39;t say anything about that but
they&#39;ll just pull anything from the DSA
platform anyway. So, I do think this
fits a little bit in that vein of like
finding the silliest possible thing.
You know, it&#39;s just funny. I mean, it&#39;s
personally fun. By the way, I&#39;m going to
I don&#39;t bench press at the gym. Uh my
trainer doesn&#39;t have me do it because he
thinks it&#39;s makes him very injuryprone,
but I have spoken to him and I will be
doing the 135 challenge. Um even though
I I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a bench press
in two years, but I I&#39;m going to do it.
It would be pretty embarrassing if I
couldn&#39;t consider my body. Yeah, sure.
I&#39;ll post a video. I I&#39;ll I&#39;ll do it
here. I&#39;ll do the bench press challenge.
I happily will. 13. That&#39;s just one
plate on each side. I mean, for my size
and body weight, I believe I should be
able to do 225. That&#39;s like the You&#39;re
supposed Isn&#39;t that the metric? You&#39;re
supposed to be able to bench your own
body weight. The one guy who is the goat
in this is Jamal Bowman, who we&#39;ve had
on the show cuz he bent 400 lb. That
That&#39;s impressive, man. That That is
That is genuinely like shockingly
impressive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He is very strong. Maybe we should book
Jamal to um give us a breakdown on all
of this. He&#39;s a he&#39;s a Zoron supporter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Zoran supporter who can bench 400. Um
yeah, I yeah, actually we should
especially on his form because again I
don&#39;t know enough about his form or
whatever to see if it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Jamal Bowman also he&#39;s it&#39;s we had him
on KKF and we had him on our live stream
when we&#39;re on the the primary and he&#39;s
just in his like giving zero mode
too. So he&#39;s fun to talk to right now
because he will just spill all the tea
about what he saw in Congress and a his
interactions with Apac and all of that.
So in any case, it&#39;d be fun to hear his
thoughts on the race uh more broadly. At
the same time there, we&#39;ve got a yet
another genuine corruption scandal with
regard to Eric Adams. The details of
this are so preposterous, we can put
this up on the screen. So, um, he has
this lady who&#39;s affiliated with his
campaign who does outreach to the
Chinese-American, um, community in the
city. And so, apparently after some
event, she said, you know, she said,
&#34;Oh, meet me o over at the Whole Foods
cuz I want to give you something.&#34; And
so, um, this reporter walks over with
Greco is the Chinese American lady who&#39;s
the the advocate, um, for Adams. And it
says, &#34;While inside the store, Greco
handed the reporter an open bag of chips
with the top crumpled closed. The
reporter thought it was an offer of a
light snack and told Greco more than
once she could not accept the chips, but
Greco insisted that she keep them.&#34; The
two parted ways before entering a nearby
subway station. The reporter opens the
bag and discovers a red envelope inside
stuffed with cash, at least one $100
bill, several 20s. Reporter then called
Greco and said, &#34;I can&#39;t accept this
money.&#34; Asked if she was still nearby so
she could give it back. Greco said she
left the area. Reporter told her she had
to take the money back. Greo said they
could meet at some point in Chinatown.
Reporter then texted Greco, &#34;I can&#39;t
take this. When can I give it back to
you?&#34; She did not get a response. In an
interview later Wednesday, the city,
that&#39;s this publication, asked Greco
what her intention was in handing money
to the reporter. In response, she&#39;d said
she&#39;d made a mistake and apologized over
and over. And actually the her specific
comments are really funny here. I don&#39;t
know if we have them, but I&#39;ll go I&#39;ll
just go ahead and read them because her
um explanation was kind of entertaining.
She says, quote, &#34;I make a mistake. I&#39;m
so sorry. It&#39;s a culture thing. I don&#39;t
know. I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m so sorry.
I feel so bad right now. I&#39;m so sorry,
honey.&#34; Then she called the city back,
advising that we call her attorney,
Steven Bril, and adding, quote, &#34;Can we
forget about this? I tried to be a good
person. Please, please, please don&#39;t do
in the news nothing about me. I just
wanted to be her friend. I just wanted
to have one good friend. It&#39;s nothing.
So, um, there you go. Um, another
interesting Let&#39;s put Eric Adams
response up on the screen. This guy,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you just can&#39;t make it up. D5. So, there
were some other issues with the same
Chinese American lady. There was like
she roped a campaign volunteer into
helping her remodel her home. She lived
at some hotel for months at a time that
was supposed to be for formerly
incarcerated people. There&#39;s all kinds
of stuff going on with this lady. In any
case, when Mayor Adams was asked about
these findings previously, he deflected
and downplayed his relationship to
Greco, saying he hadn&#39;t spoken to her
about the allegations. When I see her, I
say nihow. You know, that&#39;s hello, he
told the press. So, that was that was
his explanation of all of this. Well, it
wasn&#39;t her defense. Also, she&#39;s like,
&#34;I&#39;m Chinese. That&#39;s just part of our
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Just like Just like Cuomo is Italian, so
he&#39;s not a sexual harasser. He&#39;s just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. A little dicey there. Also, if
you&#39;re going to bribe somebody, you got
to do more than 140 bucks. I mean, what
are we doing here?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. These are, you know, these are
local reporters. It&#39;s tough times. You
know, this tough times. The news
industry is in freef fall. Couple
hundred bucks. I I can make a
difference. You know,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adams. Yeah. He&#39;s just one of the
greatest to ever do it. I&#39;m going to
miss him. I really am. He was great. Oh,
the cartoonish level of corruption with
this man. I long ago lost count. We Ross
Barkin could break it down for us of the
number of aids who were indicted under
investigation. This lady herself had
previously been under investigation. I
think she had like an FBI her stuff
seized previously if memory serves
correctly. Um but it&#39;s just, you know,
uh he&#39;s just it&#39;s like a throwback, you
know, to old school decades ago levels
of big city um machine level corruption.
And there was one other thing that was
interesting about this, which is after
the city gets their bag of cash and
reports it all out and reports her to
whatever the ethics commission is, etc.,
um or law enforcement. Then the New York
Times publishes this piece that&#39;s like,
&#34;Yeah, our reporters also saw cash being
exchanged in these envelopes from the
campaign.&#34; And it&#39;s like,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; why didn&#39;t you report that? Totally. I
agree. That is the sketch.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So weird, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just total lag. You just corruption is
just so assumed to be a part of the
Adams campaign that they didn&#39;t even
find it newsworthy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ve seen a lot of corrupt here in
Washington. I actually have never seen
cash change hands. That&#39;s the one thing
where everything is supposed to be, you
know, oh, here&#39;s some free drinks and
here&#39;s a free dinner and you get to come
to this and oh, you know, if you&#39;re on
your way there, you can ride on my jet
if you want. Everything is supposed to
be soft. Like, you&#39;re not supposed to be
able to prove it. Actual cash exchanging
hands is wild. That&#39;s like Tammy Hall
level stuff.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adams needs he just needs to launch his
own shitcoin. People can just fuddle him
cash via that because that&#39;s apparently
a thing that politicians can do now. No
problem whatsoever. Um, so Zoron, uh, as
a little tongue-in-cheek response to
this latest scandal from Eric Adams and
also just I guess because they came up
with this idea, he actually did a
citywide scavenger hunt over the
weekend. And here is how he announced
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello, my friends. I have to come clean.
I have something to hide. Many things,
in fact, because we&#39;re doing a scavenger
hunt. No, no, no. Actually, we are doing
a scavenger hunt across New York City.
When you arrive at the location, look
for a campaign volunteer who will mark
off your card and give you a clue to the
next location. At the first stop, you&#39;ll
get this card. At the final stop, you&#39;ll
find a special surprise. Not a lot of
cash, so make sure you go all the way to
the end.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, for those of you who again are just
listening, he starts with like the bag
of chips and he&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, I&#39;ve got
something to hide here.&#34; A reference and
it&#39;s the same type of chip in which the
envelope of cash had been stuffed. So,
that&#39;s a reference there or whatever.
But, I love the scavenger hunt thing. I
I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like millennial
cringe, I guess people are saying. But I
I support it. I love the celebration of
New York. That&#39;s really a key ethos of
the Zoron campaign. Um it&#39;s personally
making me very like nostalgic for the
city of New York and for the time period
that I lived there. And apparently
there&#39;s a huge response. We can put this
up on the screen, the images while you
uh while you say what you thought about
it. Thousands of people who showed up
for this freaking thing. On the one
hand, scavenger hunts, Pokémon Go, and
all of that stuff is deeply cringe and
millennial. On the other, we do have a
crisis of community and people going
outside and doing things. So, I I guess
that&#39;s kind of like kind of like uh
what&#39;s it called? Like pickle ball. You
know, the people in the tennis community
really hate pickle ball because it&#39;s
taking over the courts and all of that,
but it&#39;s the fastest growing sport in
the country. I agree. It looks silly.
Every time I play it, I feel a bit
silly. I mean, it&#39;s kind of fun. It has
zero barrier to entry and, you know,
anything that gets people moving, gets
outside is probably a good thing. So,
anyway, sorry tennis people, your
courts, we&#39;re seizing them, we&#39;re taking
them over. Uh, and I feel similarly
about this. Personally, I do think
scavenger hunting is cringe. I would not
engage. But, you know, if I was there, I
would it gets people to if it gets
people outside, it gets people doing
something, go for One of my favorite
things to do when I lived in the city
was just to explore New York because you
could explore that city and five burrows
for your entire life and constantly
every time find something new,
interesting, unexpected, etc. So, in the
spirit of that, I am a full supporter of
the Zoron scavenger hunt.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I mean, look, you know, we didn&#39;t
necessarily the uh we didn&#39;t say that
everything wouldn&#39;t be cringe, but it
can also be good. So, you know, you
never know.
