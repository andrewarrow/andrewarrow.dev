welcome back to the charismatic voice
today we&#39;re going to dive into live for
the first time and in preparation I did
read the lyrics and they are so touching
and sweet and
introspective and I&#39;m really looking
forward to how they just soar with
Melody but before we get to it I want to
give a shout out to the sponsor for
today&#39;s video better help we just hit
2025 and dates like this remind me that
there is a lot that I want to live up to
other than our regular releases three
times a week to 1.8 million subscribers
which I feel a lot of pressure for and
responsibility to be on point for we
also are fulfilling a successful
Kickstarter campaign we&#39;re forging A New
Path in voice science and I have kiddo
number two in my belly on the way
straight up I feel stressed and I don&#39;t
think I&#39;d be able to handle that stress
without the tools that therapy has
provided me therapy not only helps me to
balance my life and focus my energy on
what matters most it also helps me to
mentally set aside stresses that I&#39;m not
able to address on a given day there
will always be something that&#39;s out of
our control that we need to shove for
later or learn to let go of therapy
isn&#39;t just about making it through a
life crisis although I can attest it is
very helpful for that therapy can also
be about daily breakthroughs and
building healthy habits I want every
person to feel capable of succeeding in
their life every day that&#39;s just one of
the reasons I appreciate better help
because they make therapy easy to access
and easy to make a part of your hectic
schedule to sign up for better help you
simply go online and fill out a
questionnaire and you&#39;ll be matched with
a therapist in as little as a couple of
days you aren&#39;t restricted to local
matches and better help has a network of
over 30,000 therapists so if you need
somebody with a special expertise or
you&#39;re looking for someone that you just
really click with through better help
you can find the right fit you can also
switch therapists at any time with no
additional cost one of the major bonuses
of better help is that it is all online
you don&#39;t have to drive to therapy or
deal with parking which as a mom with a
2-year-old makes a huge difference and
you can message your therapist at any
time I&#39;ve used better help a number of
times and I fully recommend it to
friends family and to our viewers you
can click the link in description or go

charismatico to get 10% off your first
month now let&#39;s dig into some music
I like that chord
progression lightning
chist BL falls to the Flor
the angel opens her
eyes the confusion sets
in before the doctor can even close the
door this
is so emotional right away and yet it is
simple I think the chord progression and
just the repetitive we&#39;ve got
essentially four or four time and we&#39;ve
got four sets of cords the last two are
same it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not complicated at
all but it has a certain emptiness to it
like a it almost feels like the time
just slowed
down and when we get his voice in this
is Ed whose last name uh kowalik I think
or it might be kovalic comes from polish
um I might be pronouncing it wrong still
I did look it up just just put that up
there I looked it up kovalic or
kowal uh when his voice comes in
there&#39;s a a lot
of tension in it there&#39;s like almost a
tremble in the sound but
it&#39;s it isn&#39;t really powerful instead it
feels like there&#39;s a a
hesitancy like dare somebody break some
sort of sacred silence that&#39;s occurred
it has so much tension that it brings
actually to the music and it it&#39;s almost
feels like you could hear a needle drop
within this record let&#39;s go back to the
his intensity reminds me a little bit of
Mayor James Keenan
BL Center falls to the
floor the angel opens her
eyes the confusion sets
in before the doctor can even close the
door so simple and so effective
let name
CR and old mother
dies her intentions fall to the floor
Ang your
wus belongs now to the baby down
the so this is just the be the lyrics
are super
beautiful this idea of in the first
verse you have a mother uh a new mother
essentially with baby and then in the
second verse you have an older mother
that&#39;s passing and it&#39;s talking about
this the cycle of Life The Circle of
Life as put by The Lion King um I think
it&#39;s really getting at one of the the
Mysteries that we have in human
existence and pulling at some of the
most emotional moments that we can ever
experience and his voice carries that
really really well I was very impressed
with one particular moment when he sared
up higher already in the lows we&#39;ve had
a ton of emotion but when he went higher
it it felt like it just almost exploded
for a moment with
feeling I&#39;m going to go back a
little I loved this flash where they
disappeared and and the shift of here
then it&#39;s a really interesting
production choice right there as they&#39;re
moving into the next verse it it takes
us into a different area of Reverb and
that works really well with the lyrics
and this idea that you&#39;re essentially in
two different rooms different rooms have
different Acoustics and so we&#39;ve been
taken into it feels like a larger room
with this uh this next verse
a little bit more presence too in the
music her intentions fall to the
floor the angel
closes the confusion
beautiful just want to shout out to
whoever filmed this video I loved the
symbolism we had all of these hands on
faces and then praying and then looking
up there was there&#39;s been so many
parallel elements in various scenes this
is just beautifully filmed
very very touching music video to go
with very touching lyrics and emotional
delivery the coloring is also
gorgeous I feel it coming back again let
R th chasing the
windes pulling from the center of the
earth I get I can feel
CR more the
C this I I think that the shift in uh
what feels like the acoustic space at
various times that this song has been
really impressive uh just the produ
ction has done a great job of not
overdoing it but essentially letting us
move into different chapters of the song
and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s so beautiful
sometimes in music we move into
different chapters by introducing new
sounds um and sometimes we we move into
new chapters by uh changing our
perspective on the sounds that we
already hear this is definitely the
latter of those two and I just I have a
lot of respect for what&#39;s been done with
this production I think it&#39;s
beautiful we&#39;re going to talk a lot
about his vocal technique but I want to
hear a little more still there&#39;s a
spareness here and the intensity and
I&#39;ve heard him seeing in a couple
different ranges there there&#39;s a lot
that&#39;s going on and I want to hear more
still before we really really dig in I
feel it coming back again like rolling
ther chasing the wind fores pulling from
center of the earth I get I can feel
it let
crash more the C
addition of
sound the angel opens her
W pale blue colored
AR presents the circle puts the glory
out to hi hi
open my feeling coming back again like a
Ru then chasing the wind P the spoling
from the center of the
other I like the build of this it really
if it feels like something&#39;s about to
just sweep over
us uh like there like you see the
emotions coming from far out and you
know they&#39;re going to crash um but
you&#39;re not quite prepared even for when
they do
crash uh let&#39;s talk a little bit about
Ed&#39;s voice technique at this point I
have been really curious to see where it
was going because it was so sparse at
the beginning and also pent up so I was
thinking okay where like what is his
voice going to blossom into CU I I could
feel it really it it was preparing us
for a
blossoming um I mentioned mayor James
Keenan before because I think that he
has uh one of the absolute best
deliveries of uh like that pinned up
intensity angst he is the embodiment of
angst Ed here um I think it
his voice is representing so well at the
beginning bottled up emotion it&#39;s like
it&#39;s it&#39;s got a cork but it&#39;s building
and building and building it&#39;s almost
like that me that your mom made in the
basement that eventually uh popped the
bottle and explode everywhere because
there was so much pressure inside the
bottle um
he&#39;s I think in bringing more intensity
into the sound he&#39;s actually locking up
a lot of the vocal mechanism another
reason and I wanted to hear it uh play
out a little bit more he keeps his jaw
really really tight and it&#39;s it&#39;s like
he&#39;s manifested a lot of uh physical
tension um that we often associate with
holding back emotion like that and
absolutely we hear that in a person&#39;s
voice so it&#39;s like there&#39;s tightness in
the jaw um even in some of the
anunciation it it lends itself a little
bit more towards
uh a grunge style I wouldn&#39;t be
surprised if uh there was some sort of
inspiration or uh influence from Chris
Cornell in here I&#39;m actually not sure
about the
timing I think there it sounds like I
think they were around the same time 90s
um there&#39;s he has a similar feeling of
that builtup and uh even the r
coloration is leaned into a lot so we
have that that kind of grunge technique
I should really say style here I&#39;m just
essentially having a a more closed mouth
and then as he went on uh I was really
surprised when he transferred into the
highs it had a lot more ease it made me
realize that when he initially started
the song he was actually probably in the
bottom of his range and uh and then as
we&#39;ve gotten into this section as he
starts to open up with a sound his his
mouth is starting to drop a lot more I&#39;m
not just saying what I visually
see uh this this is what I hear and how
the sound is being produced so we have a
wider space in the mouth uh letting a
lot more energy out and and pour out so
I&#39;m guessing that there&#39;s a lot less
that&#39;s really held in the face and the
neck at this point
uh let&#39;s uh let&#39;s go back to where it
starts to open up here there&#39;s so much
more to talk
about the Ang opens her
eyes so I think that&#39;s really
interesting so let&#39;s see 250 is where
we&#39;re at really interesting to contrast
that tone quality
with somewhere in
here is it here
the angel closes
R so those are very similar pitches that
he&#39;s going over right that&#39;s the same
range but when we&#39;re back here at 250 it
had so much more grit in the sound more
Distortion that is being added to the
sound the first one actually was still
what I would call a fairly narrow space
in the vocal tract um but he also has a
lot of soft palette drop there so we&#39;re
getting quite a bit of nasality in the
sound too and it&#39;s very it feels very
controlled when we come over
here just go back a little
angens it&#39;s interesting he actually has
less soft pallette drop at that moment
and I think there&#39;s a little bit more um
a little more narrowing in this part of
the throat which is where it sounds like
the Distortion is coming from to me uh
we need to study that a lot more FYI uh
but it&#39;s it&#39;s fascinating because
there&#39;s more drop of the jaw as well um
those those two instances although they
are the same general pitch areas the
vocal technique behind them is wildly
different the angel opens her eyes
it&#39;s so
emotional the glory up too
high oh my feeling coming back again
like a rule the chasing the wind for the
spoling from the center of the other
I can feel
it I can feel
wow I got
Shivers I really got Shivers
there I it&#39;s amazing how sometimes the
the gritty almost ugly parts of the song
are really what gets us right
like that part got to me I love build
here and then the the opening into what
feels like we&#39;re going to bridge side
note I especially as uh as a femon
pregnant lady right
now right and I have my two-year-old at
home um as well seeing all of these
images of birth and new baby they&#39;re
really getting to me I&#39;m I&#39;m both
feeling really excited and also really
scared because
is is
terrifying but so very very special so
uh well done video team you you got me
[Applause]
oh I can feel it coming back again
back that chasing
for of
the I can feel
it I think that the tempo is speeding up
too has it has it been on a slightly
like a slight uphill the whole time I&#39;m
not sure I uh it definitely is making my
heart race more and more as the song is
going on and uh and I love the way that
this soundscape is feeling uh filling up
more and more and it wouldn&#39;t have this
effect just keep this in mind it
wouldn&#39;t have this incredible effect if
we hadn&#39;t started with that like needle
drop sort of silence and hush in the the
very first
part uh another I want to say one of the
appealing things I think about Ed&#39;s
voice is the rawness of it uh he he
definitely has what I would describe as
like very unpolished
edges uh and that&#39;s not bad some people
will be like oh whoa like we need to
like put that like back together hey if
it&#39;s working for him cool if he starts
to have a lot of vocal fatigue then go
you know go work on that and and make
sure you&#39;re keeping it for the long road
um I hear like moments where it sounds
like there needs to be extra
stabilization as breath pressure is
adjusting or things like that um but
what&#39;s happening is because it&#39;s so raw
the emotion is it is communicating
through in such an such an excellent way
I think that in a lot of society today
we have
prioritized perfect vocal
technique over the emotional delivery uh
I I also say this having done lots of
vocal competitions for Opera for me the
person that always should win is the
person who moves me the most I feel most
touched by whatever they&#39;ve sung and uh
and sometimes you get just stuff that is
so beautiful but almost cold that often
wins and I would much much prefer
someone that can make me
weep however please please if your voice
is not feeling good seek some help so
you can continue to make people weep
your entire life
I can feel
it back
again then chasing
the he has really good control of
distortion I
coming again
the C of the like I can feel
it I can I love the vocal layers that
were added here also this scene is so
touching and it&#39;s also touching to see
band members essentially leaving Shadows
behind it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like
predicting the how a band would split up
or or that band members will eventually
away like a
r chasing the we oh spoling center of
the earth like it I can feel
it I can feel coming back again like
in chasing the we
still I can feel
it I can feel
it I can see
[Applause]
you at the end of this it it feels like
we&#39;ve really embraced uh um the the
acknowledgement that sometimes life is
really ugly and sometimes it is really
beautiful and his voice the that he has
bite he has gravel at the end it almost
loses as much of that melodic sense as
well it just feels like things are have
fallen apart yet somehow they&#39;re still
held together this this feels so
introspective and deep and profound
let&#39;s go back a little bit let&#39;s go back
a little bit just appreciate these last
few moments I&#39;ll let it play out
[Applause]
again chasing the we
still again I can feel
it I can feel
it I can see you there
[Applause]
wow this is a powerful song and a
powerful music video I shout out to
everyone that&#39;s worked on this because I
mean from from the composition to the
production to the visuals that go with
it it&#39;s just and I should also say to
the execution of the composition by the
musicians it&#39;s just really really really
well done very impressive what an
incredible introduction to live if you
want to see some more music that I find
similar it&#39;s some analysis of that I&#39;ll
put up a playlist over here uh though I
don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever really get the
exact same feeling that this video was
able to give us I and that&#39;s one of the
beautiful things about music you can
experience so many different feelings so
profoundly through so many different
songs and bands may you fall more in
love with music every day
