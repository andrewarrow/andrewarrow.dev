So last week I was on Facebook and I
noticed an ad from the Walker family.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We&#39;re the Walkers, a family of musicians
offering one last chance to turn your
story into a song. My dad started this
in 1989. One guitar, one voice, and
someone&#39;s story.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait, why do they look so
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; adding her melody in the living room?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Me and my sister grew up around this and
eventually we added our own style, too.
Together as a family, we created
thousands of custom songs, but now we&#39;re
closing it all down. AI is replacing
what we&#39;ve done by hand for decades.
Okay, time out. What do you mean that AI
is replacing you when you clearly are
made with AI?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Submit your story now. Let us turn it
into a song you&#39;ll never forget.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, so this family of fake musicians
will record a custom song for you. Huh?
I&#39;m calling BS, but then Meta does what
Meta does and starts following me
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m James Walker.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My dad started this in 1989.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My family has made people smile, cry,
and heal through custom songs for over
35 years, but now we&#39;re closing it down.
And then I noticed how many people were
commenting on these ads. They couldn&#39;t
say enough good about this family and
their music. Were these actual
customers? My first thought was that
they&#39;re all bots and fake accounts
because who would actually fall for this
and have a positive experience. But the
more I dug, the more curious I became.
These are actual people. Look at this
customer about to surprise his wife with
a custom anniversary song from the
Walker family.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Did you make one?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He knows he&#39;s just won husband of the
My love.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I even looked up the walkers on Trust
Pilot and I could see that they have a
4.9 rating with 448 reviews and
counting. I thought, have I misjudged
these musicians? Are they for real?
Maybe they&#39;re just wearing a lot of
makeup under some really harsh lighting
and they&#39;re actually the modern-day
Partridge family.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I said, you know, maybe I should have
them write me a song. So, I go to their
website where it says, &#34;Every melody is
crafted with heart, care, and a whole
lot of love just for you. And each song
is currently only $99.95.&#34; I said, &#34;If
this family is closing up shop for good,
I probably better get me one of these
songs while I can.&#34; So, I started to
place my order. And I say that this is
for my wife, I leaned over. You get it,
right? I leaned over. I say this is for
our anniversary. And they asked me to
pick an artist. And I&#39;m not sure why I
have to pick just one. and I thought
they recorded this music together as a
family. Anyway, I go with James because
after all, he started this business.
Then it&#39;s asking me for some prompts,
and that seems like language that you
would use if you were trying to generate
something with AI. But they told me that
this wasn&#39;t AI.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No templates, no AI, just your story
turned into music.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I&#39;m not too worried. Anyway, I write
the most ridiculous story about how I
met my wife. I say, &#34;We locked eyes at a
competitive fret fashion show held in
the basement of a Pizza Hut in Nebraska.
I was a judge. She was a contestant. Her
fret, Sir Squeakhams, was dressed as
Abraham Lincoln. I gave it some
additional details and then I added it
to my cart. And you&#39;re probably
thinking, &#34;This is a really stupid move
to buy something from a sketchy website
like this.&#34; But I had to get to the
bottom of this. But I do try to be
careful when I&#39;m shopping from
questionable websites. And that&#39;s why I
used a privacy.com virtual card for this
transaction. Today&#39;s video is sponsored
by Privacy. And privacy lets you create
virtual cards that you can use anywhere
online instead of exposing your real
card number. You just set up a funding
source and then you can create cards
with spending limits, close them
anytime, or even lock them to a single
merchant so no one else can use them.
For this purchase, I set a $100 limit
and had the card close after it was
used. So even if the site tried to
charge me again, it wouldn&#39;t go through.
I also like using these cards when I
shop online because if anything ever
happens like a data breach or a stolen
number, I can just pause or delete the
card without touching my bank account or
changing my payment information
everywhere else. You can use Privacy for
subscriptions, online shopping, or
budgeting. Just cap the spending limit
on each card, and you&#39;ll never overspend
without realizing it. Give it a try
yourself and go to privacy.com/pleasant
green. That&#39;s privacy.com/pleasant
green and get a $5 signup bonus for your
first purchase. Privacy is free to use
and there are no transaction fees for
domestic purchases. I don&#39;t love
spending money on sketchy websites, but
with Privacy, I know my real card
details are safe and I&#39;m in control of
every single transaction. Go to
privacy.com/pleasant green right now.
Grab your $5 signup bonus and make your
online shopping a whole lot safer. Link
is in the description and the pin
comment below. Well, right away I got an
email that said, &#34;Hi, Benjamin. Thank
you for your order. I&#39;m excited to bring
your story to life in a special song.
I&#39;ll be getting started right away. And
if you have any extra details you&#39;d like
to share or questions, just reply to
this email. I&#39;m here for anything you
need. Best James Walker. Wow, an email
from James himself. I said, &#34;Thank you,
James. Do you know when the song will be
ready?&#34; He said, &#34;Hi, Ben. Thanks for
reaching out. Typically, the song
creation process takes about 3 to 4 days
to complete from the time of your order.
I&#39;m already working on it, and I&#39;ll be
sure to keep you updated on its progress
as I move forward.&#34; I thought, &#34;Sure,
you will.&#34; But believe it or not,
exactly 4 days later, I got a custom
song from the Walker family. And this is
my live reaction upon hearing it for the
first time.
Kathy. Kathy. Who the crap is Kathy? I
wrote back to James to see what was
going on, but he quickly took care of it
and was able to locate the correct song.
In the basement of a Pizza Hut, Nebraska
the lights were cut,
sequins flying, smoking air,
but all I saw was you standing there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, I&#39;m shocked. This family actually
wrote a custom song based on my bizarre
ferris story.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pizza Hut fashion star.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wasn&#39;t expecting them to actually
deliver anything much less something
this good. So I knew I had to try it
again. So this time I pretended to be I
leaned over and I ordered a song for my
husband Bendover. I said, &#34;Ben and I do
everything together from training our
pet raccoon Greg to competing in
backyard Olympics to dressing up as
giant corn dogs and handing out coupons
at the DMV.&#34; Absolutely weird stuff. But
let&#39;s see what the walkers can do with
this one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DMV
Um, okay. I guess the Walker family is
the best group of musicians in the
world. So, if they&#39;ve been doing this
for 36 years, why haven&#39;t I heard of
them until now? Surely, there must be
some music video of them somewhere on
YouTube or pictures of them from a
concert somewhere. But I can&#39;t find
anything. So, I take a close look at
James, and for some reason, the James in
this ad looks a little different from
the James in this ad. Okay, so who&#39;s the
real James? I used a cool tool called
lenso.ai AI that I found is pretty good
at searching faces online. And I can see
that this James has appeared in some
other videos.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; First five people with the ugliest
kitchens. Yeah, you. We&#39;ll help you
upgrade with custom cabinet doors for
more than 50% less than a full remodel.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, so James owns a kitchen cabinet
and he&#39;s German. What about his
daughter? I did the same thing and I
found hurt in the thumbnail of a video
from a guy talking about how to create
UGC ads with AI. And he points me to a
website called Arc Ads where apparently
they will help you create winning ads
with AI actors. But I can&#39;t get any
further without signing up for a
subscription. So I end up signing up
using a privacy.com virtual card to do
this since I&#39;m only trying it out for a
month. But then I&#39;m in. And check this
out. They&#39;ve got over 300 AI actors that
you can choose from, including Guess
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey you. Welcome to Archads. I&#39;m one of
the natural AI actors you can use for
your ads.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And the famous James Walker himself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey you. Welcome to Arcads.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And apparently you can make these AI
characters say whatever the heck you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey everybody, it&#39;s me, James Walker. It
turns out I&#39;m just an AI generated actor
that someone is using to sell custom
music. It&#39;s a good thing Pleasant Green
figured it out for you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How many of these UGC videos and
testimonials have I watched where the
person talking wasn&#39;t even real? Hey,
Pleasant Green. You just got tricked
into spending $200 cuz you thought I was
a real musician. That&#39;s got to be
embarrassing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the question still remains, who
wrote the music? Ironically, I asked
Grock for help. I asked if it could
compose a love song for me with just a
few prompts, and it said it was just a
textbased AI, but it did point me to
some other AI services like sununo.com.
So, I went to check it out, and
apparently they can make any song you
can imagine. Just type in any idea you
have. And I thought, there&#39;s no way it&#39;s
that easy. So, I just asked it to write
a song about the first thing that popped
into my head.
And within 60 seconds, it spits this
little melody out.
[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this for real? Then I got more
specific and I said, &#34;Write me a song
about a scam baiter named Ben.&#34; Then it
gave me this. Down in his basement with
coffee in hand, Ben&#39;s got a mission, a
line in the sand.
He fights for the folks who don&#39;t
understand how scams creep in like a
thief in the land. Open the scam later.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, I&#39;m absolutely terrified. This was
written by a robot in less than a
minute, and that&#39;s got to be what the
Walkers are doing. Here&#39;s my theory.
They claim to be an American family, but
they&#39;re either based in the Philippines
or the Netherlands because that&#39;s what
I&#39;m seeing on their Facebook
transparency page.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Walker Songs is a real American family.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, my privacy.com charge is telling
me that this is a foreign merchant and
they have not been making music for 36
years, like they say, cuz their
website&#39;s only been up a couple months
and they&#39;re clearly using Arc ads to
create these ads to get people to drop
$100 for tribute songs when you can just
go to sunseo.com and do it yourself for
free. I actually had to pay $10 for the
commercial rights to use these songs in
this video.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am never going to financially recover
from this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But doing that is not as cool as hiring
a beloved American family of musicians
to write you a love song before they
retire. That&#39;s the type of gift that
tugs at your emotions and makes you
spend big money on a birthday or an
anniversary gift. And the real reason
why they&#39;re getting out of the music
business isn&#39;t because of AI. It&#39;s
because it&#39;s only a matter of time
before people realize that this is a
scam. So, I wanted to confirm my
hypothesis. So, I wrote them as I leaned
over and I said, &#34;Where are you guys
based? I would love to catch you in
concert and thank you for the song you
wrote for our family, Eileene.&#34; They
responded and said, &#34;Hi, Eileene. Thank
you for your kind words and for your
interest in seeing us perform live. We
truly appreciate your enthusiasm for the
song that we created for your family.
Regarding your question about concerts,
we actually don&#39;t typically perform live
concerts. Our focus is primarily on
creating personalized songs for our
clients. Thanks, Walkers.&#34; And I&#39;m like,
&#34;Okay, but where are you guys from?&#34;
They said, &#34;Hi, Eileen. Regarding your
question about where we are based, we
appreciate your curiosity. However, for
privacy purposes, we generally do not
disclose our specific location. Thank
you for your understanding on this
matter. Thanks, Walkers. I don&#39;t know
why they&#39;re hiding it. They&#39;re telling
people on Facebook that they&#39;re from
Cheyenne, Wyoming. I said, &#34;Are you
based in the USA?&#34; Because my credit
card was hit with a foreign transaction
fee. They said, &#34;Yes, we are indeed
based in the USA. We apologize if this
wasn&#39;t clear previously and for any
foreign transaction fees you may have
incurred on your credit card. Sorry,
ain&#39;t going to cut it, Mr. Walker. I
said, how do you explain the foreign
charge on my transaction? And how do you
explain the fact that your page is
managed in the Netherlands? Oh, I guess
one of you is in the Philippines. And
then they wrote back with a long
explanation and said, &#34;As a small
business, we are not very familiar with
the intricacies of online marketing and
e-commerce setups. We had assistance
from a third party to set up our
Facebook page and other online
presences. And it appears there might
have been some technical or geographical
settings that were configured
incorrectly or without our full
understanding. This could explain the
foreign transaction fee and the
information you&#39;re seeing about the
Netherlands or other locations.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is one big pile of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, this whole response was written by
AI. So I wrote back one more time and I
said, &#34;Okay, because I want to order
another song. Can you please verify if
this is your Facebook page?&#34; But hidden
in this link was my own link meant to
grab their IP address. And you better
believe they clicked it. And I can see
that they&#39;re based in Makotti City,
Philippines.
I wrote back and I said, &#34;Are you guys
performing any upcoming events in
Makatti City?&#34; And eventually they
stopped responding.
You know what they say, it&#39;s not AI
that&#39;s going to take your job. It&#39;s the
person who understands AI that&#39;s going
to take your job. And whoever&#39;s behind
the Walker family knows this. and
they&#39;re probably making a killing with
this little business of theirs. I just
think that it&#39;s really rich that the way
that they&#39;re selling this service is by
warning you about AI and convincing you
to support actual musicians when that&#39;s
exactly who they&#39;re hurting. Guys, the
future is going to be wild and we need
to start recognizing how AI is creeping
in before it&#39;s weaponized against us.
Hopefully, you found this enlightening.
I sure learned a lot. But let me know
what you think this means for the future
of the human race and I&#39;ll catch you in
the next video. Damn Vera, a modernday
knight with a keyboard sword. He steps
up to fight. He warns the world on the
glowing screen, don&#39;t fall for the
tricks of the cyber machine.
