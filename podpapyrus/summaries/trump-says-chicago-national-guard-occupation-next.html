Good morning everybody. Happy Monday.
Have an amazing show for everybody
today. What do we have Crystal?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Indeed we do. Many things to discuss
this morning. We have Trump announcing
plans to do to Chicago. What he&#39;s
already done in DC and LA. Sag and I
will have a chat about that one. Um Gain
Maxwell&#39;s interview was released. Lot to
say about that one. Um you know, you
should definitely take the word of a um
sex criminal for sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll break it down.
should definitely take that one at face
value. Okay, the US is taking a 10%
equity stake in Intel. Actually, very
interesting move. A lot to discuss there
and some broader economic indicators we
want to take a look at as well. Zoron is
facing a new scandal over how much he
can bench,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whether he can bench at all. Whether he
can bench at all.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And um he also had this big scavenger
hunt in New York City. Thousands of
people turned out. So kind of an
interesting development with regard to
his campaign, too. Meanwhile, Eric
Adams, yet another corruption scandal
encircling his campaign. The details are
preposterous, just utterly ridiculous,
uh, which is kind of part for the course
for Eric Adams. So, uh, we&#39;ll dig into
all of that. I&#39;m taking a look today at
modern-day Holocaust denial with this
uh, starvation denial in Gaza. And we
have a special guest. This will be, I
think, some pretty significant news, who
was fired from the State Department
apparently for his views on Israel. So
he is going to join us and um this our
his first interview that he&#39;s given
right on uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah I believe any sort of podcast or
cable news or anything like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We were able to arrange it uh after he
was fired and so yeah uh trying to break
some news here over at breaking points
which is a good reminder by the way
thank you to everybody who&#39;s been
signing up at breakingpoints.com and
help supporting the show. It&#39;s because
of you uh that we become the first place
to be able to interview do some news
making stuff here have people in power
actually pay attention. And I don&#39;t
think it is an accident that he reached
out to us uh very first thing after
talking to the Washington Post for first
on camera interview. And so that&#39;s what
you guys enable. Breaking Points.com if
you&#39;re able. Otherwise, by the way, no
worries. If you can&#39;t afford it, just
please hit subscribe on the YouTube for
the YouTube button. I believe that&#39;s
what it is. Hit subscribe for our
YouTube channel. And if you&#39;re listening
to this as a podcast, just go ahead and
send this episode, any episode, whatever
your favorite interview it is to a
friend or family member. It really helps
us grow by word of mouth. So with that,
let&#39;s get to the show.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. So, uh, President Trump
announcing that he is planning to expand
his National Guard deployments. Uh, of
course, started in LA, both with
National Guard, federalizing the
National Guard there and calling up
active duty, uh, calling in active duty
Marines here in DC. Of course, we&#39;ve
been dealing with that over the past
couple of weeks. And next, he says, is
Chicago. Let&#39;s take a listen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we haven&#39;t had to bring in the uh
the regular military, which we&#39;re
willing to do if we have to. And after
we do this, we&#39;ll go to another location
and we&#39;ll make it safe. Also, we&#39;re
going to make our country very safe.
We&#39;re going to make our cities very,
very safe. Chicago is a mess. You have
an incompetent mayor, grossly
incompetent. And uh we&#39;ll straighten
that one out probably next. But they&#39;re
wearing red hats. Uh African-American
ladies, beautiful ladies are saying,
&#34;Please, President Trump, come to
Chicago. Please.&#34; Uh I did great with
the black vote as you know and uh they
want something to happen. So I think
Chicago will be our next and then we&#39;ll
help with uh New York.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So apparently this uh plan has been
weeks in the making. We can put the
reporting up for the Washington Post on
the screen. Um they write Pentagon plans
military deployment in Chicago as Trump
eyes crackdown. Here are some of the
details. They say the Pentagon has for
weeks been planning a military
deployment to Chicago as President Trump
says he wants to crack down on crime,
homelessness, and undocumented
immigration in a model that could later
be used in other major cities. Officials
familiar with the matter said the
planning, which has not been previously
disclosed, involves several options,
including mobilizing at least a few
thousand members of the National Guard
as soon as September to what is the
third most populous city in the United
States. They go on to say um an
additional piece of reporting with
regard to the deployment here in DC that
troops here are soon going to be allowed
to carry firearms which is a change to
their initial orders. Let me give you
one more piece of reporting here. This
from uh Jackie Heinrich over at Fox News
in a relatively lengthy Twitter post. We
can put this up on the screen and I&#39;ll
give you the the TLDDR here. So she
reports that 1,700 National Guardsmen
are set to mobilize in 19 different
states in the coming weeks to assist DHS
amid sweeping federal inter agency crime
and immigration. Crackdown documents
obtained by Fox News show planning for
activations in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,
Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico,
Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and
Wyoming. So these are states with
Republican governors. So this would be
um presumably in cooperation with the
federal government and soccer turning
back to Chicago. Um this would be in
terms of the legal framework this would
be more akin to the deployment in LA
because um in DC they&#39;re you know the
federal government is more directly
involved. They have more legal
authority. Now even here it&#39;s supposed
to be a quote unquote emergency.
Unfortunately the courts have sort of
broadly defined what constitutes an
emergency. There may be a court
challenge there as well, but the LA
National Guard federalization and
deployment was much more legally
contested and still, you know, there was
at least one federal judge that actually
said you can&#39;t go forward with this. So,
this would be, you know, this is the LA
model now coming to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s right. And it hasn&#39;t wrapped
actually that court case as I understand
it. What I what I and this is very
complicated. So, just stick with us. But
on DC, people need to remember that
because it&#39;s technically under federal
rule, what it allows is the
federalization of the MPD in a quote
unquote emergency, but that emergency
has to be renewed by Congress every 30
to 45 days. Uh there&#39;s obviously still
open question as to whether that is even
going to pass. Obvious most Republicans
are probably going to go for it, but
that is why the DC federal police the DC
government and police department can
come under genuine federal control and
they have much more leeway for the
mobilization of the National Guard on
top of that. So I mean we can I&#39;ve said
here I think the mobilization is stupid
broadly especially because you know in
my uh trapesing around the city the only
place I can find these guys is down by
the National Mall protecting the food
trucks and the tourists. So you know I
guess thank you for keeping us safe. I
have actually yet to see them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh take take a ride down to the mall.
You&#39;ll see plenty of them. They&#39;re
rolling around. They&#39;re all eating halal
from the halal truck. So, I mean, I
guess that&#39;s great. Uh yes, apparently
they&#39;ll be carrying uh weapons now. I
mean, the White House is like, &#34;Oh,
well, we have uh what is it? We&#39;ve
arrested all these people and there
hasn&#39;t been a murder in DC in 9 days,
which I mean, apparently DC was
averaging like two murders a day, so or
two murder every two days, so you can
give them that, I guess. No one exactly
sure on the uh actual causal effect, but
Chicago is a whole other different
story.&#34; Right. And I think that&#39;s
actually if you read the Jackie Heinrich
reporting, what you&#39;re seeing is about
that assistance with ICE and with DHS.
But honestly, even that is very dicey
legally because there is a prohibition
under posi commitatus that the federal
government can&#39;t even mobilize National
Guard for civilian law enforcement
purposes. They&#39;re currently being
mobilized under something called, let me
I have it in front of me. It&#39;s called
title 32 section 502F authority to which
Posi commitatus does not apply. Now,
that section actually sets out quote
required drills and training for the
National Guard. And it says a member of
the National Guard may be ordered to
perform training or other duty in
addition to their regular drills and
annual training as prescribed by the
Secretary of Defense. They&#39;re saying
that they could be used under for
federal benefits. Remember this, for
things like quote homeland security
operation, counterdrug, airport
security, border support, CO 19, and
natural disaster relief. So that would
be the deployment. But even if it were
to come about, it would not be even
remotely like Washington because you
can&#39;t quite literally cannot federalize
the Chicago Police Department for a like
for example, they can&#39;t here in DC,
they&#39;re rolling back like cashless bail.
Uh that&#39;s something that they&#39;re allowed
to do because they have federal
authority. And same with the police
commissioner who can report up over
there. It is entirely a matter of the
locality that reports of from Chicago
police to the mayor Brandon Johnson. And
also people should keep in mind like the
governor and the mayor both have both
openly spoken about against this and it
would be very different much more akin
to Los Angeles where national guardsmen
can like guard federal property. I don&#39;t
even actually know if federal properties
in Chicago but anyway. So like they can
do that courts and things like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyway, they can do that if they want
to. they can help quote assist with ICE
operations although apparently even that
is like a little dicey in terms of the
way that it all goes about. So it would
be a deployment and almost certainly at
this point as we know for show purposes
which is mostly what we see from the
administration.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, that&#39;s right. I remember when we
were digging into the details with
regard to the legality of the LA um the
the California deployment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s supposed to be done in conjunction
with the governor. like it&#39;s really
supposed to be the governor who asked
the president and that&#39;s a key piece of
what was being debated in court and as I
said one federal court judge said no no
no this is not lawful then you had uh at
the appeals level they issued an
injunction against you know saying okay
well we&#39;re going to allow it to continue
while this all plays out in court but
this is continuing to play out in court
I&#39;ll say some of my commentary because
we&#39;re going to talk about Bill Maher and
his commentary on this and then we can
talk a little bit more broadly about the
implications Obviously, I find this, you
know, incredibly ominous. It&#39;s both a
combination of buffoonish and pointless
and a waste of money and also, you know,
quite, in my opinion, ominous to see
these normalization of the military in
American streets for domestic law
enforcement. All of these masked up
agents. Um, there was actually a
horrible incident uh just recently where
two guys who disguised themselves as law
enforcement were, you know, pounding on
the door of a homeowner. homeowner uh
you know smartly doesn&#39;t let them in and
ends up actually shooting and killing
them. Um there have been other instances
of masked people coming in claiming to
be ICE, claiming to be law enforcement.
And you know it&#39;s not to say that has
never happened before in the past, but
when you have the normalization of these
masked unidentified agents who refuse to
even tell you what agency they&#39;re with,
let alone what they&#39;re there for, let
alone show you a warrant, you know,
nobody should be surprised that those
are some of the consequences that
unfold. Uh I can go ahead and put up on
the screen A4 which is Governor Kitsker
of Illinois&#39;s response. He says the
state state of Illinois at this time has
received no requests or outreach from
the federal government asking if we need
assistance and we have made no requests
for federal intervention. The safety of
the people of Illinois is always my top
priority. There&#39;s no emergency that
warrants the president of the US
federalizing the Illinois National
Guard, deploying the National Guard from
other states or sending active duty
military within our own borders. Donald
Trump is attempting to manufacture a
crisis, politicize Americans who serve
in uniform, and continue abusing his
power to distract from the pain he&#39;s
causing families. Will continue to
follow the law, stand up for the
sovereignty of our state, and protect
Illinoisans. Um, is that Illinois?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s a is it Chicago? All right,
people there can let us know. In any
case, um obviously, you know, not lost
on anyone that it&#39;s uh blue states that
are facing these uh you know, military
deployments. Even though, look, it&#39;s not
about crime. I think we can all be
honest about this has nothing to do with
crime. This is about domination. This is
about a show of force. This is I think,
you know, in some ways, yes, a
distraction from me didn&#39;t like the
storyline about Epstein and other things
going on. I think that&#39;s true, too. But
um you know at bottom it really is not
about crime because if it was this would
be an it would be an entirely different
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean the yes and no because the
we&#39;ve talked about this violent crime is
not the only metric. Quality of life
crime has to of course be one. There&#39;s
no question quality of life crime
especially in the biggest cities which
are all democratic or blue or liberal in
some form are much worse to be in. Now,
I think there&#39;s a lot of questions as to
why, and Chicago is a very good example.
And this is part of why honestly Chicago
is probably the best pick out of all of
them because it&#39;s the one with the most
clownish mayor, Brandon Johnson. What
does he have? An 80% disapproval rating,
20% approve. He basically was elected as
some sort of like DSA/, you know, BLM
style candidate, and he&#39;s been a
disaster mostly for the city. Don&#39;t
don&#39;t listen to me. Listen to the people
who actually are his own constituents
who can&#39;t stand him. The violent crime
rate there has technically fallen, but
if you look at the overall spike in
homicides, I mean, they were 60% higher
in 2021 than in 2019. That feeling and
general, you know, like safety in the
city of Chicago is one that was like the
number one cause for people who were
leaving the city, which is destroying
their tax base. That is empirically the
same problem across the entire like
major cities in America. This isn&#39;t just
about Memphis or these other places. And
it&#39;s also a bit of a copout in my
opinion because like Memphis never
claimed to be like the third Memphis is
not the third largest city in the United
States. It&#39;s not a center of commerce.
The re like it&#39;s lost on no one. These
are all blue states.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m not I&#39;m not Can we like just be
honest about what&#39;s going on here? And
can we also be honest about imagine if
you had a Kla Harris administration or a
Joe Biden administration that was
deploying the National Guard into red
states to enforce CO rules. I mean,
everybody would be freaking out. And
yet, you know, this pretext of, oh, it&#39;s
about crime. That&#39;s just complete and
total DC is not even like in
the top list of cities for violent crime
in the country.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I am not saying that this is all about
crime. What I am saying is that I think
it&#39;s bad and a bad idea for Democrats
particularly to not acknowledge the fact
that most their cities suck to live in.
And I think that that is one of those
which needs to be like centered at the
heart of blue governance. This is one of
the things I appreciate.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; True.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it is true. I mean, these are all
like net population loss
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cities. And here&#39;s the thing. If you
want to get violent crime down,
it&#39;s not just about violent crime. If
you want to get crime down to like
European capital levels, then okay,
let&#39;s have European style gun laws.
Let&#39;s have European style social safety
We&#39;ve always lived in a gun ownership
country. Haven&#39;t always had this level
of violent crime. Now the point is is
like if you go back to the let&#39;s say
2000 the year 2000 if you check both
violent crime and just generally were
you walking down the streets seeing
homeless vagrants constantly harass
people on the street. It was not
happening. We had plenty of guns. Yes,
there are 400 million guns in this
country. Our violent crime rate and our
homicide rate is always going to be
orders of magnitude. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not
necessarily the metric why you need to
look at. You need to look at the fact
that a lot of these places have skyhigh
taxes. They have sky-high cost of living
and they are very unpleasant to be in.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The National Guard and Fed. I mean,
that&#39;s the thing is like I just I hear
you on the crime. We&#39;ve had the debate
like we can continue to talk about this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is not about crime. I agree. This
is about domination. This is about
dominating democratic cities and states.
It&#39;s about a show of force. It&#39;s about
what he can get away with. And it&#39;s
about yes, distracting from whatever
else. So, I just don&#39;t even want to like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that&#39;s the problem. don&#39;t even
that&#39;s what I want to No, it&#39;s not
because the minute that you go down this
rabbit hole of oh well let&#39;s talk about
what&#39;s really causing crime in DC or
Chicago versus Memphis blah blah blah
you are playing into his narrative that
this has anything to do about crime and
it does not if you cared if if he cared
about homelessness if he cared about
juvenile delinquency any of these things
the Republicans wouldn&#39;t have stripped a
billion dollars from the DC budget you
know they wouldn&#39;t have cut so many of
these programs that were just slashed
during Doge across the board. They he
wouldn&#39;t have pardoned the January 6
violent rioters. So that&#39;s why I just
have no use for this conversation that
even like, you know, gives credence to
the idea this has anything to do with
crime. I&#39;ll give you the counter case
for that is that Trump still has the
approval rating of where Obama was in
his second term. And the fact is is that
and was elected with a popular vote of
some 1%, the first president since 2004
for a Republican to actually win it. Why
did all of that happen? Now Kamla is a
part of it. I think the city governance
is a big part. Especially if you look at
the blue state swings towards Donald
Trump. People are broadly fed up. And if
you look at the fact that with these
polling around this, people say it is a
bad use of taxpayer dollars, people say
that it&#39;s buffoonish, but they
acknowledge the crime and if it was
being done properly, they would be very
okay with it. Now, I&#39;m against just
generally the federalization and I agree
that it&#39;s being buffoonish and the way
that it is being done is for political
purposes. The reason why I think again
the crime, the vagrancy, the
homelessness, the drug addiction, all of
that has to be put on the table is no
one can objectively look at Chicago and
say, &#34;Yeah, this place is doing well.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, put it on the table, but it has
nothing to do with this. It&#39;s a totally
separate separate topic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; See, what you said is exactly the
problem. You said, &#34;Oh, a billion.&#34; If
money could fix DC, DC spends more per
capita per student than any other public
school district in the entire nation. It
has nothing to do with money. It&#39;s about
It&#39;s literally about criminal
enforcement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It definitely does have to do with
money. And by the way, once again, crime
is way down in DC. DC is from 2023.
We have the lowest on track with the
lowest level of violent crime in 30
years in this city. Baltimore, same
thing. Baltimore is having their lowest
level of homicides in like 50 years.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And actually, Baltimore is the one who&#39;s
prosecuting the all these.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s significant. Okay. So, you don&#39;t
need to send in the freaking National
Guard. That&#39;s This is the thing is like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s
This is not about crime. So yes, do I
think that there is, you know, a
narrative about, oh, democratic city is
in decline and chaos, blah, blah, blah.
A lot of which is and
overblown, by the way. But do I think
there&#39;s a narrative about that that has
some political salience? Yes. Let&#39;s be
honest that this has nothing to do with
solving that problem. Nothing to do with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I agree. I&#39;m with you. I I don&#39;t think
that we&#39;re that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all part of
art. But I do think I mean again it does
drive me and a lot of other Republicans
crazy when they look at people like oh
Washington it&#39;s like no it sucks. It
sucked for a long time. Chicago sucks.
Like San Francisco there are parts of
Chicago which are beautiful. When we
were there I was actually wow this is
actually quite nice. A lot of the media
narrative is wrong but the overall per
capita crime rate in many of these
neighborhoods is a disaster. And that is
the part where politically again you
cannot just like oh it&#39;s not about crime
if you don&#39;t have an answer to crime
because then Trump is going to win every
single time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Crime is down. So clearly there are some
answers to crime which are being deploy.
I mean and that&#39;s the other thing is
like what frustrates me is when there&#39;s
all this hand ringing about ringing
about crime which justifiably like
people deserve to be safe. They deserve
to live in neighborhoods where they feel
comfortable. Yes. On board with all of
that. But then there&#39;s no willingness to
talk about, you know, changing gun laws,
right? That&#39;s completely off the table.
If you look at us, Illinois&#39;s got one of
the strictest gun laws.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you look at us as a nation versus
other countries around the world, the
big outlier is in in terms of gun
ownership. So, you know, if we&#39;re going
to talk about why this country is
overall so violent, and by by the way,
some of the red states have the highest
crime rates in the country. If we want
to talk about that versus the rest of
the world, you have to talk about guns.
You have to talk about social safety
net. You have to talk about the fact
that we have this vast inequality and we
have very little in terms of social
safety net. We have very little in order
to support people including young people
who feel utterly hopeless. But instead,
we&#39;re just going to like roll in the
National Guard and pretend like that&#39;s
any kind of a real solution. It&#39;s just
so frustrating for positive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I think it&#39;s completely fair and it is
true that the National Guard is not the
solution. And I do think the gun thing
has to be acknowledged. It&#39;s obvious. We
have 400 million guns in the country.
I&#39;m not for gun control. Also, by the
way, it&#39;s just not going to happen. And
Illinois has some of the strictest gun
laws in the entire nation. So within the
framework of like quote the possible
where we&#39;re going to acknowledge yes,
we&#39;re going to have violent crime. We&#39;re
never going to be a European capital. We
don&#39;t live in Geneva. We don&#39;t live in
Zurich. We don&#39;t live in Vienna. That&#39;s
Tokyo. Any of these places that is not
politically feasible. What is feasible
is the year 2000 in my opinion. And now
we have to all ask how exactly did we
get to this point here? Is the National
Guard I I just I continue to emphasize
it for a sole reason. I continue to see
this BLM style, oh, it&#39;s all because of
social state. It&#39;s like, no, it&#39;s not.
It&#39;s addiction a huge part of it and
it&#39;s soft on crime policy. And the fact
is is that if you embrace like a
narrative of actually crime is down when
in reality it&#39;s still very high compared
to 200.
How does our incarceration rate compared
to other countries?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, we have one of the higher
incarceration. Okay, it&#39;s because we&#39;re
soft on crime. That&#39;s nonsense. Well,
yeah, but there&#39;s been a great shift
since the year 2020 of which the the
consequences have been disastrous. And
it isn&#39;t just about incarceration. If
those policies are still in placement,
why is crime going down? Because they&#39;re
not being enforced
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; S I mean I look those policies I&#39;m not
going to say that they don&#39;t have any
impact. Okay, I think that would be
dishonest. But I think if we talk about
okay what has really changed between
like let&#39;s say the year 2000 was the
benchmark you set out on and now
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we are suffering through a national
societal breakdown right inequality is
skyrocketing part of it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; social misery and stress and political
polarization like all of these things
are pulling us apart. It is no surprise
that at a time when you had the the
COVID lockdowns and an additional level
of stress and isolation and loneliness
that yes, out of that you see a a spike
in crime, not to mention, you know, kids
being out of school and all these sorts
of things. So, you know, I I&#39;m not I&#39;m
not going to say the policies don&#39;t
matter, but I think the bigger picture
is those broader societal trends, which
is why this is not a blue state or red
state or red city or blue city thing. It
is a national epidemic that we struggle
with which has a lot of contributing
factors and none of which will be sol
solved by the national guard standing
outside of Georgetown cupcakes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One of the things you didn&#39;t mention is
illegal immigration which actually some
of this probably will be targeted
towards and so that is an important part
of the story as well where you have a
mass illegal immigrant population which
has ballooned since the year 2000. So
look, this is why even if you look at
violent crime compared to my benchmark,
violent crime is actually, if you look
at 2000, it wasn&#39;t a great year for
violent crime. Like that&#39;s why it&#39;s not
the right benchmark. The benchmark is
quality of life. The quality of life has
many different constituent parts to it.
And inequality certainly, but again like
culturally juveniles here today are not
getting prosecuted. Juvenile like
delinquency is a genuine BLM creation
like from 2020 post on here in
Washington. ATV gangs, lawlessness,
cashless bail. These are BLM policies
directly implemented as a result of the
protest which have skyrocketed crime in
New York City, in Washington DC,
Chicago, Brandon Johnson 2023, they went
ahead and implemented cashless bail. I
get it. It if you think about cash bail,
it sounds inequitable, but the
consequence has been a disaster. And so,
I mean, we covered that story of that
guy who what did he do? He like ran into
it was in the state of Illinois, I
believe. He like ran into some parade
and killed a bunch of people. released
on bail. I mean, these are cashless
bail. This is always the issue is that
we don&#39;t evaluate all of this like new
age policy. Oh, we need to talk about
addiction and and not criminalize it.
It&#39;s like, well, look at Skidro, look at
San Francisco, look at the most
noncriminalized areas for people in
addiction. It has destroyed the quality
of life for the residents of those
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, we should definitely not criminalize
addiction. We should have much more
forceful rehab as you and I discussed.
Again, I come back to the point. None of
this has to do with the National Guard.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fair.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None of it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None of it. And so that&#39;s why I I find
it frustrating to even like indulge the
conversation when it&#39;s very clear what
is being done here. It&#39;s the the whole
attempt is to get this conversation put
on the table. even though Trump has no
interest in solving it, has been more
procriminal than maybe any other
president given the way that he&#39;s
pardoned not only you know not only the
J6er but all these like you know white
collar criminal fraudsters who just like
pay the right person and are able to get
their pardons. So that&#39;s my core
frustration with the way this
conversation is unfolding. Um, let me
get to the West Moore part because this,
you know, this relates to what we&#39;re
discussing. We can talk about Bill
Maher, um, and get into, you know, some
of the sort of darker possibilities of
uh, what Trump is is doing right now.
So, let&#39;s go and put A5 up on the
screen. Trump going directly after
Westmore as governor of Maryland. Talked
about as a presidential candidate. Um,
he&#39;s, you know, not really my style. Uh,
he&#39;s a little too moderate, corporate,
etc., etc. But in any case, Trump says,
&#34;Governor Wesmore of Maryland has asked
in a rather nasty and provocative tone
that I walk the streets of Maryland with
him. I assume he is talking about outofc
control crime ridden Baltimore. As
president, I would much prefer that he
clean up this crime disaster before I go
there for a walk.&#34; Wesmore&#39;s record on
crime is a very bad one, unless he
fudges his figures on crime like many of
the other blue states are doing. But if
West Wesmore needs help, like Gavin
Nuskum did in LA, I will send in the
troops, which is being done in nearby
DC, and quickly clean up the crime after
only one week, there is no crime and no
murder in DC. When it is like that in
Baltimore, I will proudly walk the
streets with the failing because of
crime, governor of Maryland. P.S.
Baltimore is ranked the fourth worst
city in the nation in crime and murder.
Stop talking and get to work, West Wes.
I&#39;ll then see you in the streets. And
then he goes on to say, I gave Westmore
a lot of money to fix his demolished
bridge. Not even true. that came from
Joe Biden, but and he says, &#34;I&#39;ll now
have to rethink that decision.&#34; Okay. Um
Wesmore responded to this on the Sunday
shows. Let&#39;s go ahead and take a listen
to what he had to say.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Are you so opposed to this deployment?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, there&#39;s a there&#39;s plenty of
reasons. Uh you know, one, it is not
sustainable. You cannot continue this
type of pace of operations, particularly
when you&#39;re when it&#39;s costing over a
million dollars a day in order to do
this. The second, it&#39;s not scalable.
You&#39;re not going to be able to do this
in every single major American city,
particularly when many of the cities
that have the highest crime rates are
the places that have actually deployed
their national guards to Washington DC.
So, who&#39;s going to who&#39;s going to go do
the work in their cities? The third,
it&#39;s unconstitutional. It&#39;s a direct
violation of the 10th amendment. The
fourth reason is because it&#39;s deeply
disrespectful to the members of the
National Guard. You know, as someone who
actually deployed overseas and served my
country in combat, to ask these men and
women to do a job that they&#39;re not
trained for is just deeply
disrespectful. And so when we&#39;re
thinking about all of these lasting
factors, when we&#39;re thinking about the
fact that it serves as a distraction
from the fact that the president&#39;s
disastrous economic policies are making
everything more expensive for everyday
Americans, is making life harder for
everyday Americans there. There is a
multitude of reasons that I am against
this and I will not authorize the
Maryland National Guard to be utilized
for this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So his reasons were he said it&#39;s
unsustainable, it&#39;s not scalable, it&#39;s
unconstitutional, and it&#39;s a
distraction. So that was his uh his take
on all that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, look, I mean, which you know I
mean he didn&#39;t downplay the obviously
Baltimore has long had a um a crime
issue although they have done a better
job this year in particular violent
crime is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they have done they have done yes the
social worker part of it is not the
whole story uh prosecution is a big part
of it uh having dug a little bit into it
but yeah let&#39;s give it credit where it&#39;s
due I will say Moore also is diving into
what is it into the gerrymandering fight
and he&#39;s going to make it so there&#39;s
only one Republican seat in the state
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; no there is there is currently no only
one and they&#39;re just going They&#39;re going
to get rid of that. They&#39;re going to
take it away. So, race to the bottom, I
guess. I mean, Maryland is it&#39;s been a
blue state, I guess, now for quite some
time. Might as well just make it
official. I think Moore is uh I think
he&#39;s quite talented, actually. I mean,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like you said, I&#39;m a
bit suspicious of the more corporatized
element of it. and he does seem very cut
of the mold of like exactly what the
centrist Democrat would want and almost
wears it on his sleeve a little bit
about like practicing with the football
squad and all of that making it go quite
viral. But I mean there&#39;s no question
he&#39;s quite popular actually in the
state. It is generally smaller. Um and
in terms of national profile I don&#39;t see
it as much for him as with Newsome. But
if Trump picks a fight with him
obviously then he&#39;s going to get his
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;d be very elevating for him. Yeah.
And I think a lot of Democrats, um,
ambitious Democrats are looking at the
Newsome model and they see that like
this is working for him, you know, and I
don&#39;t know why it took them this long to
realize that, you know, trying to trying
to troll Trump, like get in his face,
make a lot of noise, be controversial.
Obviously, that&#39;s what you have to do in
this era. And so, um, I think Wes Moore
is trying to do kind of his own version
of that. And um the pick the the fight
that Trump has picked with him is
obviously very elevating for him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Anyway, uh I think broadly look,
yeah, to wrap up our discussion, I
agree. I think the National Guard and
most Americans are smart. I&#39;ve always
believed that uh you can see through a
lot of what this is, even people like me
who are like, &#34;Yeah, I think crime is a
huge problem. I think illegal
immigration and all of that is a huge
problem.&#34; If they view it as showmanship
and is not serious, then they&#39;re going
to get upset. Uh, I I do wonder
politically how it shakes out because it
sounds quote unpopular and all of that
today. What I continue to wonder about
is the actual merits of how the
Democratic opposition fights this. And
that&#39;s why, you know, that&#39;s part of
what I thought our discussion is
important for is if the alternative is
seen as still like soft on crime, then
it will be a genuine question at the
ballot box, especially for the future of
the discourse as to like what this will
look like in terms of preference because
we have to be honest like you know, even
if you look back at the height of BLM,
sending in troops to the cities was
broadly popular and especially in
retrospect if you go back and now look
at come one or two years later on the
question of that polling people were
very upset by the the breakdown of the
social order chaos and they&#39;re not going
to pick in general in my opinion people
will pick social order over everything
that is not actually a good societal uh
natural instinct but it is broadly true
the question politically is how this
will sustain it I think Gavin one of the
ways that he was smart was talking about
rule of law and they weren&#39;t doing the
BLM style like actually it&#39;s mostly
peaceful most Democrats were criticizing
the Mexican flag burning you know, like
the burning of the cars, rioting, and
any of that. That seems to be a
politically palatable position that I
think a lot of centrist more Americans
could go with, but it is still like a
very live question today. I can see
where the centrists are going, but I
also see where the activist base is, and
so I&#39;m still curious to see how that
actually shakes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, I think it&#39;s a very
different moment from the moment of co
and BLM because there is a sense that
like, you know, things have calmed down
in these cities and it&#39;s not this
heightened moment that it was at that
point in time. I was just looking there
is a little bit of polling. Um, I mean,
who knows how this shakes down, what
people really think in the long run and
all of that, but um, data for progress
found a majority of voters, 51% oppose
the Trump administration taking over DC
police force and deploying the National
Guard in the city. So, um, 44% support,
51% oppose. That&#39;s basically right in
line with Trump&#39;s approval rating.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I think it really is just like a
vector for do polarization. Do you trust
Trump or do you not trust Trump? And
you&#39;ve got a lot of people too who um
you know think that it is indicative of
um authoritarian. Trump is being
authoritarian. 57% Trump is just doing
this to distract from other issues. 51%
more than half of voters. 51% also agree
Trump is doing what&#39;s necessary to crack
down on crime. Though voters are closely
divided with 46% disagreeing with that
statement. So that&#39;s it seems like it&#39;s
kind of a wash and just matches up with
partisan sentiment around how you feel
about the person of Donald Trump at this
