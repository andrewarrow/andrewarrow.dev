brought to you by the every dooll app
start budgeting for free today so I&#39;m a
single dad struggling to put food on the
table for my
kids um I don&#39;t have any credit card
debt I do have a auto loan um that I&#39;m
majorly upside down on um I&#39;ve got about
$4,000 in medical
debt um and probably the most
embarrassing one is I haven&#39;t filed any
taxes in the past
the this coming season will be three
years I just have not had the money to
them and I&#39;m tired of living paycheck to
paycheck ends are not meeting I make
about $80,000 a year I should not be
this broke I just I need some
okay when were you
um about six years ago
okay and you&#39;ve never really taken
control of your whole life since then
it&#39;s all kind of just happened to
you yeah I I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never been taught
how to manage finances I don&#39;t know
anything about it yeah but what you
described to me was you&#39;ve been
coasting yes just today you took a step
to try to figure out how to fix it but
you&#39;ve been
coasting yes Zer doar in the bank at
before every paycheck yeah and $80,000
you ought to have some money shouldn&#39;t
you yeah you should yes are you
self-employed I don&#39;t
know um I work as a 1099 contractor yeah
okay that&#39;s what I meant yeah yeah okay
so um well the the first thing we do is
we get on a written Game
Plan called a budget and we make every
dollar that comes in behave and starting
this month you&#39;re going to set aside 25%
of every dollar that comes in to pay
taxes so if you get a $1,000 check
you&#39;re going to take 250 and put it in
the savings account to pay your
quarterly estimates on your taxes and
then you&#39;re going to do a budget with a
remaining $750 per thousand follow
me okay you&#39;ll make every dollar behave
and you&#39;re going to withhold on yourself
because you have no money in the bank to
pay three years worth of taxes this is a
right and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re going to
have somewhere around $60 $80,000 in
taxes on these three years you&#39;ve been
making 80 a year of those three
years uh pretty much yeah yeah okay so
you probably got you know 60 Grand going
to be ow plus
penalties right okay so now here let me
you have a tremendous responsibility as
a single dad that people do not get get
put in jail in America for not paying
their taxes they do get put in jail for
not filing
them so you have 24 hours my friend to
get at ramseys solutions.com and click
on tax ELP endorse local provider for
someone in your area to sit down and you
get those taxes filed I don&#39;t want you
leted away in bracelets at connect
I hope I&#39;m scaring you
2571 people went to jail last year for
failure to
file it is a law it&#39;s a criminal law not
paying is different you can get away
with not paying you can&#39;t get away with
not filing get your freaking taxes filed
