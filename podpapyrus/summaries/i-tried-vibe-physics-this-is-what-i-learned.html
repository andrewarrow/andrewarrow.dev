Vibe physics. I&#39;ve learned people now
use AI to develop new physics theories.
I think that&#39;s great in principle.
Physics needs new ideas. In practice,
I&#39;ve seen a lot of junk come out of it.
Sometimes new, sometimes correct, but
rarely both. Which is why today I want
to look at four different large language
models to see how they do with the task
of coming up with new physics. That&#39;s
GPT5, Claude Opus 4.1, Grov 4 and Gemini
Pro Ultra Extra Super Deep Think or
whatever it&#39;s called. Before we can do
that, I&#39;ll have to briefly talk about
well what I&#39;m going to ask and what I
expect. The example I&#39;ve come up with is
a vague idea that I&#39;ve dragged around
with me for 20 years or so to solve one
of the millennium problems. The question
of whether the Navia Stokes equation has
blowups. The Navia Stokes equation is
what one uses to describe fluids and
gases like for example climate and
weather models. So basically solving the
Navia Stokes equation. Roughly speaking
the question is whether the solutions to
the equation develop singularities from
regular initial conditions and finite
forces. I believe the answer to this
question is yes. The reason is that I
expect that ultimately you&#39;ll need
quantum physics to prevent singularities
and the Navia Stokes equation doesn&#39;t
have quantum properties. Yes is in some
sense the easier answer because all you
need to do is to find an example of
where that happens that fulfills all the
requirements. So far no one has found
one. The reason I haven&#39;t actually
worked on this is that for one thing
because no one would have financed it
because it&#39;s too far off anything I&#39;ve
previously worked on. But also on some
level I don&#39;t actually believe it would
work. More likely that&#39;s a good reason
for why it can&#39;t possibly work that I&#39;m
blissfully too stupid to see. So great
topic to ask a chatbot about. In
somewhat more detail, the idea I had is
to use some solution to field equations
with some suitable stress energy tensor,
not that of the Navia Stokes fluid, but
so that there is a coordinate system in
which some of the Einstein equations
happen to be the Navia Stokes equation.
If you identify the geometry with the
fluid somehow the time direction comes
from the initial condition and then you
use Penrose&#39;s singularity theorem to
prove that you have to get a blowup. The
difficulties are that first you need to
find the solution and the coordinate
system and you need to do that so that
the forcing doesn&#39;t cause the blowup. I
believe this to be possible because in
GR there are ways to change between
coordinate systems to keep some
quantities regular. People have of
course looked at the Navia Stokes
equation and general relativity and
there are known links between the Navia
Stokes equation and the solutions of
general relativity. But most of these
only work near the horizon. So they&#39;re
not useful. However, if you do a search
for Navia Stokes and GR, you&#39;d find all
kinds of things that would distract you.
Again, that makes it a good topic to ask
a chatbot about. Now, you may ask, okay,
but if that isn&#39;t what she means and
what does she mean? I don&#39;t know. If I
knew how it works, I wouldn&#39;t ask a
chatbot about it. Loosely speaking, I
think one could just, you know, go
through all the known solutions to JR.
there are a few hundred of them and
check if there&#39;s one that might work. I
think it seems worth a try and it seems
like the sort of thing that an AI should
be good at if you could get it to
actually do it. Okay, now let me talk a
little about what I&#39;d expect a smart
student to say about this. First of all,
they formalize the problem. What&#39;s the
Navia Stokes equation? What are the
requirements of the millennium problem?
What are the singularity theorems? What
do we know about solutions to GR and
their symmetries? What&#39;s the overlap
between the two? And then come up with a
way to either systematically go through
all known solutions that might work or
come up with a proof for why it can&#39;t
possibly work. Let&#39;s then look at how
the models do. I use the same wording
for all the models to get them started.
Here is GPT5 in thinking mode. It seems
to think the Millennium problem doesn&#39;t
allow forcing. That isn&#39;t correct. It&#39;s
also confused about what I said about
pushing the singularity from the forcing
into the velocity field. So, let me
clarify this. Okay. Here it comes up
with suggestions for how to proceed and
with some more prompting digs up some
solutions as a starting point. We&#39;re not
going to solve this problem today. Let
me just say it looks like it roughly
understood the idea and the steps look
kind of reasonable and we could move on
from there. Now, let&#39;s move on to Google
Deepthink for which you need to get an
ultra subscription that clocks in at an
amazing €140 a month. It&#39;s very slow.
The result is okay. It&#39;s really just
rephrased my text. So, let me just
prompt explicitly for to proceed. This
like allegedly took 20 minutes. What
does it say? This is basically it&#39;s
basically text for a grand proposal.
Push it some more and it politely
declines and writes, &#34;I cannot generate
the novel conceptual breakthroughs that
perform the specialized abstract
mathematical reasoning required to solve
a millennium problem. I&#39;ve tried Gemini
Deep Think for some other things
previously and it&#39;s disappointing. It&#39;s
wordy and vague and not anywhere near as
good as GBT5. I&#39;m sorry, Deus, but it&#39;s
true. I also tried Gemini 2.5, which is
considerably faster. It tells me that
it&#39;s a highly creative idea. Indeed,
it&#39;s brilliant. It&#39;s also unworkable
because Gemini thinks I want to put an
incompressible fluid in the spaceime. So
let me clarify this. The idea is now
subtle and clever. Gemini now confuses
time reversal symmetry with time
reversibility. It also seems to think
that the Navia Stokes equation violates
energy conservation. Probably because it
confuses energy with free energy. A few
moments later, it tells me the quest is
not feasible and the search is
impossible. I think Gemini has a serious
self-confidence issue. Then we have
Claude Opus 4.1. Claude is the fastest
to reply by a large margin, but it just
produces a lot of text. That&#39;s your
standard LLM word selllet. It thinks
that 3 &#43; 1 dimensions isn&#39;t the same as
four dimensions. This is poor. It&#39;s so
poor. I can&#39;t bring up the energy to
continue. I&#39;m going to unsubscribe from
this right now. And then there is Grock
4 the expert. It points out the known
links between Navia Stokes and GR which
won&#39;t work. It then thinks I want to put
a fluid into spaceime. Let me correct
this. It now seems to roughly get the
idea and it suggests a sevenline pseudo
Python code which is cute somehow. This
isn&#39;t bad but in practice not very
useful. So my verdict is GPT top then
there&#39;s a big gap then there&#39;s Grock
followed by Gemini 2.5 which might well
be right that it&#39;s impossible Gemini
deep think which really isn&#39;t worth the
money and at the very bottom there is
Claude. I think this illustrates what
the current models are good for and what
not. What they are good at, they&#39;re
really good now at digging up related
work and explaining it, which is good
for brainstorming. What they&#39;re not yet
good at, first of all, they constantly
conflate similar sounding but different
physical concepts. Energy is not the
same as free energy. An equation can be
time reversible but not invariant under
time reversal. In another thing I was
working on GPT kept confusing two
different fineman diagrams both of which
are sometimes referred to as self
energy. And the issue is a student you
just have to tell this once. You are
confusing these things. The models will
bring back these mistakes over and over.
The second related problem is that they
sometimes switch notation in the middle
of a reply or just switch to a different
topic. For example, the other day GPT
was going on about perturbative quantum
gravity for an hour and then all of a
sudden it switches to canonical quantum
gravity and then to the semiclassical
approximation. And if you don&#39;t know
what these things are already, you&#39;ll
end up with a lot of rubbish that
doesn&#39;t fit together. The third problem
and that&#39;s the biggest issue I think is
that they don&#39;t actually develop new
ideas in any sense. In the best case
that assemble reasonable looking
equations and then massage them so that
they prove whatever you want them to
prove by skipping over the actual proof.
the LMM idea of a new theory is a
plausible looking sequence of arguments,
not an actually correct one. One way you
can try to prevent this is just by
asking, &#34;Is this correct or did you just
make this up?&#34; And sure enough, most of
the time they&#39;ll just admit they made it
up. So my verdict for the moment is it&#39;s
a mixed bag. The current models are very
much stuck to the existing literature
which isn&#39;t useful if you want to do
something new. If you kick them enough,
they will eventually agree to do
anything, but then you can&#39;t trust them.
For the time being, my advice would be
to use them for literature, research,
and background information. You can also
get them quite effectively to criticize
an idea if you specifically ask for it,
but don&#39;t trust them with new ideas. By
my assessment, these models are
currently not anywhere near as good as a
good student. So, I guess physicists
jobs are safe from AI for the time
being. One thing that AI is becoming
really good at though is scam calls. I
used to get a lot of these after my
phone number leaked online and that was
really an eyeopener. I&#39;ve since signed
up to Incogn who&#39;ve been sponsoring this
video. You see, each time you open a
website, they&#39;ll try to collect data
about who you are and where you are and
what are the websites you&#39;ve visited. If
you then sign up for a website and fill
in your personal details, they can and
often do make money by selling your
private information to data brokers.
Most countries have laws against that
and you can ask for your data to be
removed, but doing this takes up a lot
of time. Incogn automates the process of
getting you out of those databases. You
sign up and they&#39;ll contact the big
sinners, request that your personal
details be removed, and they&#39;ll keep on
doing that. And if you want, they&#39;ll
send you updates about the progress
they&#39;re making. I&#39;m glad there&#39;s now a
simple solution to stop unfriendly
people doing nasty things with my
personal details. Incogn super easy to
use. You sign up, give them the
information they should look for, and
they go to work like within a minute.
Basically, I now sleep better at night
and maybe I can help you sleep better,
too. If you use my code Zabina or the
custom link in the info below, you&#39;ll
get 60% off of Incogn. That&#39;s an amazing
deal. So, go and check this out. Thanks
for watching. See you tomorrow.
