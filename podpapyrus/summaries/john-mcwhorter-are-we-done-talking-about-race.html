you know, I&#39;m I&#39;m weird. I&#39;m just I&#39;m
weird. And so, that&#39;s part of the reason
I don&#39;t want to write a memoir because I
think people would be waiting for

uplifting and all they would get is just
one weird thing happening after another.
Welcome to the Unspeakable Podcast, the
podcast that will soon be renamed the
Unspeak Easy with Megan DM. That&#39;s me,
your host. Before we get to my interview
with John Mcuarter, a quick reminder
that on September 3rd in New York City,
I&#39;ll be in conversation with novelist
and columnist Lionel Shrivever. We&#39;ll be
talking about all kinds of things,
including my new book, The Catastrophe
Hour and also Lionel&#39;s books and columns
in The Spectator. This is happening at
the Village Underground Comedy Club at 6
PM. Doors open at 5:15 and we&#39;ll be
selling books there. Although, you can
buy your book ahead of time. you should
have bought it already. The link to buy
tickets is in the show notes and you can
also go to megan.com/events.
If you purchase your tickets soon, you
can get a discount by using promo code
catastrophe 18 at checkout. It&#39;s going
to be a great night and I would love to
see you there. My guest this week
probably needs no introduction to most
of you. He is John Mcuarter, a professor
of linguistics at Colombia and one of
the most incisive and trenchant
commentators about race and culture
working today. Uh he&#39;s the author of
several books about language, most
recently pronoun trouble. Uh a must
readad if you like me get hung up on me
versus I, which we discuss at some
length in this conversation. John&#39;s
book, Woke Racism, about the madness of
the George Floyd era of racial
reckoning, came out in 2021. He&#39;s also a
columnist for the New York Times, a
frequent guest on Real Time with Bill
Maher, and for nearly 20 years has been
having regular conversations about race
and other issues with the economist
Glenn Lowry on Glenn&#39;s podcast, The
Glenn Show, which was originally the
Black Guys at Blogging Heads. Um,
despite all of that, uh, John rarely
makes podcast appearances, so I&#39;m
grateful that he did this one. It is a
very fun conversation, and I will say
quickly that John will be a speaker at
our unspeak easy co-ed weekend coming up
October 11th and 12th in New York City.
Uh, a small gathering for big ideas.
You&#39;ve heard me talk about it. John will
be joined by others you may know from
the podcast including Carol Hooven, Mike
Pesca, Peter Moscows, Rob Henderson, and
many others. So for tickets and info, go
to the unspeaky.com/rets.
But more importantly, right now for our
purposes, here is my interview with John
John Mcuarter, welcome back to the
Thank you, Megan. Good to be here.
I want to talk with you about a number
of things. I want to talk about language
since that&#39;s really your main beat. I I
feel like you get pulled to the side and
recruited into culture war conversations
when you&#39;d rather just be writing about
Yeah. Um
yeah, that that&#39;s true, but I can I can
I can fake it when necessary.
Yeah. I guess you got to you got to do
your time every once in a while. I mean,
you you write not just about language,
but music and theater and things like
that. Um, but I want to start by
touching on race for just a little bit
here. It&#39;s coming up on five years since
Woke Racism was published or four years.
Maybe it&#39;s four years.
Four. Yeah.
Four. Okay. Sorry. Five years since
everything that you talked about in the
book was happening, but four years since
the book came out. So many of the major
targets of your critique, people like
Ibram X Kendy and Robin D&#39;Angelo have
kind of faded into the background.
hope maybe by by my lights. Do you think
your work is done there? How are you
feeling about the state of race
discourse?
Um, I think that I&#39;m glad I wrote woke
racism because I wanted to make a
statement that I think was going to
carry more weight if a black person
wrote it. A black person who&#39;s
middle-aged, not too young, not too old,
but right in the middle. And I think it
got into the conversation and I think
that it helped people sitting on the
fence understand that it didn&#39;t make
them bad people not to agree with the
excesses. And from this vantage point, I
would say that D&#39;Angelo and Kendi are at
least not novelties. They&#39;re not the hot
thing anymore. I think a critical mass
of people are now able to admit that
frankly White Fragility is a really
stupid little book. I mean, it&#39;s just
it&#39;s literally I have said one of the
worst books ever written. The second
worst book I&#39;ve ever read. I mean, it
really doesn&#39;t make any sense.
Okay, wait. What&#39;s the Wait, what&#39;s the
first book? What&#39;s the What&#39;s the worst
book you ever read?
The worst book I ever read was about 40
years ago. It was this book called
Cartoon Monikers and it was written by
this poor soul who thought he was
writing a book about why vintage cartoon
characters had their names but often
there is no real reason and he didn&#39;t
have anything to say and so you know
Daffy Duck was called Daffy Duck because
he was Daffy. It was the stupidest book
I have ever read and I thought how did
this get published and so that was the
That&#39;s very random for the the worst
book ever. I mean, doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t
that kind of uh violate the rule that
you&#39;re not really supposed to pick on
somebody if they&#39;re not if they&#39;re not
sort of on a on a pedestal? You&#39;re
punching down there, John.
To be honest, yes. Although I read it
when I was like 18 and so I was kind of
You were a young
Yeah. So, it&#39;s not me reading it now and
thinking, who&#39;s this idiot? But frankly,
when it comes to white fragility, I kind
of am thinking that. And I think people
realize it&#39;s a very thin piece of work.
And with Kendi, I have to speak
carefully, but um
through many many interviews with him, I
think you can see him interviewed. You
can you can see the things that he
their limits. You know, he he he&#39;s
working with a let&#39;s say he&#39;s working
with a very spare pallet. And I think it
it&#39;s become clear. I mean, some people
are capable of improvising and some
people have a wide range of interests,
etc. He&#39;s got a very compact mission and
kind of that&#39;s all he does. And so, for
example, you can&#39;t help noticing that he
started writing for the Atlantic as part
of his um massive fame in 2021. He
doesn&#39;t now, and I&#39;m I&#39;m only going to
say this here, but if you read what he
wrote, it&#39;s clear that he just kind of
ran out. He didn&#39;t he only had so much
to say. I I don&#39;t know anything more
than that but that and so that era of
frankly the overpromotion of certain
people who press certain buttons at a
time when a lot of people wanted the
button pushed that&#39;s over but the kind
of wokeness that I&#39;m talking about is
still in full flower. It&#39;s just that
it&#39;s not about race anymore. It&#39;s like
trying to you know play whack-a-ole with
a gopher. It keeps coming up in
different guises. the tone of the campus
Gaza protests and the way it&#39;s often
discussed is really that same high
wokeness and and I have to tread
carefully here
the way certain trans activists behave
in terms of just refusing to allow fact
and I am you know quite protrans I
understand all of this but if you&#39;re
going to talk about trans and sports if
you&#39;re going to talk about trans in the
bathroom these are complex issues and
there are certain trans advocates that
just won&#39;t listen that&#39;s that same
crusading highwoke impulse expressing
itself through that as opposed to George
Floyd. So, it&#39;s still with us. It&#39;s just
in different places, but it does not all
but run society the way it did for a
couple of strange years.
Okay. I am I&#39;m am very interested that
you brought up trans. We&#39;re only um five
minutes into this conversation because I
was going to save this till the till
till the end and we don&#39;t have to, you
know, get really into the weeds, but
just for a second here, you don&#39;t really
talk about gender. I mean, this is not
something that you&#39;ve been interested
in. And I remember one time you said to
me, you asked me like what, Megan, like
why are you so interested in this? Like
what what is it about this? And I was
like, it&#39;s got so much there&#39;s like it&#39;s
such a tapestry and like it&#39;s
essentially, you know, an argument about
what is reality. So anyway, but we don&#39;t
have to we don&#39;t have to really get into
that. But but so so but you do you you
have observed though that that the trans
thing does seem to be everywhere like it
kind of insinuates itself to a lot of
lot of discussions. So so you would say
that it&#39;s sort of trans and Gaza have
become the the centerpieces of this kind
pretty pretty much yeah the the
extremity of it does not perplex the way
it perplexes many people. I just think,
&#34;Oh, yeah, that again.&#34; Whereas I was
almost perplexed in 2020. But yeah, it&#39;s
it&#39;s that same thing.
Yeah. Well, I thought it was
interesting. Um, you wrote a piece uh
recently um defending Zoran Mandan&#39;s
Well, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s defending
it, but saying you you didn&#39;t
necessarily see anything wrong with the
fact that he checked off uh
African-American on his college
application. So, he is an American and
he is from Africa. He&#39;s not black. Um,
te tell me more about that. Why is that
Well, you know, I got the feeling he was
kind of trying to be clever because they
do have something where you can write in
what you think of yourself as. And he
put Ugandan and I think he knows very
well that when you put Ugandan, you
think of a dark-skinned African person,
not this South Asian person. He he knew
he was trying to be cosmopolitan. I
don&#39;t necessarily think he was trying to
seem like he was black, but he was
trying to express his ethnicity. But my
thought was really there just shouldn&#39;t
have been this African-American box
anyway because the term has always been
clumsy and it&#39;s now just it&#39;s it&#39;s
useless because it refers to such a wide
range of people that it doesn&#39;t make any
kind of even intuitive sense. And it it
came in a long time ago now. I never
liked it because I felt that to say that
I am African or even to say that Chris
Rock if you&#39;re going to pick somebody
quote unquote blacker to say that Chris
Rock is is African is too much of a
stretch. Nigeria, Angola are too far
away. We don&#39;t speak the language. We
don&#39;t move like them. We don&#39;t dance
like them. We don&#39;t talk like them. We
don&#39;t eat like them. It&#39;s it&#39;s been too
far. But, you know, where do you draw
the line? And people, you know, often
have a certain sense of pride and
tracing themselves to Africa rather than
the big bad United States. I understand
that. But it&#39;s at the point there too
many actual Africans now. In 1988, the
actual African immigrant was relatively
rare. You know, Eddie Murphy could do
routines making fun of them. And you
were thinking, &#34;Yeah, that that one
African I might know.&#34; But now there&#39;s
been this explosive number of
Africanameans.
And you know, what do we all have in
common? And also the South Asian story
in Africa isn&#39;t known as well. And so it
might seem forced for you know mom
Donnie to say well I was born in Uganda.
He&#39;s one of many many there&#39;s a whole
community of South Asian Ugandans and
they feel as African as a Nigerian
because they lived there for
generations. So Mam Donnie has memory of
being there. So he can say
African-American but then what does this
term mean when really that box was there
for really black people born in the
United States the you know the as
as they&#39;re often called. So, I just
think it&#39;s time to junk the term. It was
cute in the 90s roughly, but it was
always forced. It&#39;s ugly. You can&#39;t
shorten it. Somebody can say, &#34;I&#39;m
Italian.&#34; He can&#39;t say, &#34;I&#39;m African
because, for example, I&#39;m clearly not.&#34;
And so, it ends up sounding like a
medical condition, African-American.
Just time to time to let it go. It it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s out it&#39;s served its usefulness
if it ever had any. I think we should
just go back to black. And some people
said, &#34;Well, why not negro? You don&#39;t
you have to choose what hill you&#39;re
going to die on.&#34; But black was fine.
Everybody still likes it better. Let&#39;s
just keep it.
What? When did African-American come
about? Because it I seem to recall it.
It was sort of like
it was it was insinuating that there was
something crude about saying black. Like
it was racist to say black. So they
invented this like it&#39;s it&#39;s a really
sort of highfulutin sorry to use that
term but I can&#39;t think of another one
way of saying black.
It happened like it was in one week in
the spring of 1988 as I recall it. Jesse
Jackson said something and this is back
when it meant something when Jesse
Jackson said something and the change
really did happen and yeah there was a
sense for a while that black was kind of
crude. I remember the the sitcom Murphy
Brown I have to call it the sitcom
Murphy Brown now because it&#39;s like
talking about Fibra McGee and Molly but
the very popular at the time sitcom
Murphy Brown had a whole episode where I
forget why but Candace Bergen&#39;s main
character kept on having to say black
and she kept saying black black. The
idea being that it&#39;s this kind of dirty
word rather than African-American.
That&#39;s how it was. But nobody&#39;s ever
really liked African-American and black
to the extent that it has any negative
connotations which for better or for
worse it can. African-American now
basically carries the same ones. The
gnats come and settle down on the new
term. And so African-American, you know,
if you have certain stereotypes, you
know, if you&#39;re thinking about, you
know, gangs or, you know, things going
on in certain cities, African-American
has the same flavor. It doesn&#39;t help.
And so it&#39;s just time to to let it go, I
Well, it also um erased uh people from
the Caribbean. I mean, like you woke
around in New York and I don&#39;t even know
what what percentage of the black people
walking around are not African at all.
That&#39;s right.
They&#39;re from places like Jamaica and
Yeah. And then you have to think, well,
the Caribbean nations have a history in
Africa, but it&#39;s indirect. Exactly. And
so why why have this term just make it
about color and just say black and
everybody will know what we mean
even that doesn&#39;t completely work but
right. Okay. But do you think that like
Elon Musk for example should be able to
check African-American on his college
application?
Yes. I think that the whole term should
be reconceived as people who grew up on
that continent and probably have an
accent as opposed to Cedric the
Entertainer. He&#39;s black. That&#39;s how I
think of.
Right. Okay. Well, so you wrote a column
uh recently called Wokeness Will Always
Be With Us. Um which is what we&#39;re
talking about now. I was honored that
you name checked my book, The Problem
with Everything. That was so thank you
for that.
Uh yes. But I was even more um uh
tickled that you mentioned the blog
Stuff White People Like,
uh which I loved. I actually wrote about
it in 2008. So that blog surfaced um
during the 2008 presidential election I
I believe and I thought it was so
interesting because I mean it was
remember the preppy handbook. Were you a
fan of the preppy handbook?
I remember it well. Yeah. Early 80s.
Lisa Burnback who&#39;s a friend of mine.
That is the most brilliant that and
class by Paul Fussell I I think are the
sort of the two seinal popular texts
about um
I would agree. I would agree. Fussle
pushes it a little hard sometimes, but
yes, that they are classic texts in that
I mean, she really gets I mean, the
preppy handbook is like not only a sort
of mastery of um of satirical writing,
but she really gets at something quite
quite uh nuanced and it&#39;s kind of
couched in this silliness. But, um
period piece that is but yeah, that was
great anthropology. Yeah.
Yeah. I think it was early 80s. I think
maybe 1982 or so that came out. Anyway,
um but you know I the thing about uh
about stuff white people like so this
was a blog and it was sort of very much
in that spirit and it was making fun of
this kind of elite and PR class.
Um but what was amazing about it and
this is so emblematic of its time was
that it wasn&#39;t about race per se. It was
about taste
and sensibility. And you know, um, Obama
was on the list of stuff white people
like, but not Hillary.
That&#39;s right.
Interestingly, right?
Yeah. I remember also thinking with that
blog, I&#39;m white in that sense, you know,
in terms of those tastes, etc. I thought
this is me, you know, the movie
Sideways, etc. Yeah, exactly. It was it
was brilliant in that way, but it was
not about color. No, it wasn&#39;t. And
nowadays, that would be considered quote
unquote problematic. you know that that
a whole lot of the jokes that he made
would be seen as dismissive of having a
commitment to dismantling structures
etc. You couldn&#39;t laugh about it anymore
and so particularly being offended
capital B capital O is something that
white people like on behalf of people
who you don&#39;t even belong to. That now
would be considered a sacrilegious thing
to say by the high woke crowd. The idea
is that if you&#39;re not offended then
you&#39;re not a worthwhile human being.
There&#39;s no joke to be made. That really
shows a difference between what feels to
me like last week and today. There&#39;s
there was a seismic shift that you wrote
about that you caught in the late teens
that made that being offended entry in
the blog no longer funny. And it
required discussion.
Yeah. So, yeah. And and Christian
Lander, who was this guy who&#39;s 29 at the
time, who started to white people like,
&#34;Oh, wow. I didn&#39;t know that.&#34;
I know. I know. So, yeah. He was like an
ad. Um, I only remember this because I
pulled up a column I wrote about this.
He was like an ad, a copywriter in Los
Angeles. So, it was, you know, it was a
blog. It was like this silly blog. So,
um, yes. So, awareness was something
that that white people liked. That&#39;s how
he that&#39;s how he put it. So, um, yeah, I
just I&#39;m remembering this and this is
this is gerine to like what you think
about and what we&#39;re talking about. So,
examples include not having a TV. That&#39;s
straight out of fussle if you remember.
So, and he said the number one reason
that white people like not having a TV
is so that they can tell you that they
don&#39;t have a TV. Um, I mean, this is
like of its time. Indie music to to a
white person being a fan of a band
before they get popular is one of the
most important important things that
they can do with their life um and uh
and uh awareness.
Didn&#39;t Fussell have um I haven&#39;t read it
since then. Didn&#39;t he have it that um
working or lowerass people have plastic
Popeye&#39;s on their TV set?
Yes. And ex-class people who are like
the the sort of white people who are
have sort of cultural currency but are
not wealthy, they can ironically have
like a plastic plant on their TV and
Yeah. So if it&#39;s ironic, that&#39;s uh
that&#39;s CL that&#39;s classic if it&#39;s in
quotation marks. If it&#39;s in earnest,
it&#39;s not. And also having the TV um
hidden. I mean, you can have a TV, but
it has to be hidden.
I remember that. That&#39;s right. It it
can&#39;t dominate the living room. Yeah.
Right. Yeah. That&#39;s tacky.
Yeah. But I mean, right. So, white
people, he wrote, &#34;White people firmly
believe that all the world&#39;s problems
can be solved through awareness.&#34;
Um, and so, so that was sort of how that
went. But, I mean, I was just, I was
struck by this, that, you know, you
don&#39;t have, I think this is what I wrote
in my column, like you don&#39;t have to be
white to be white.
Exactly. It it was, you know, Obama
Obama was like, you know, whiter than a
lot of people. And I always I mean, Bill
Clinton was supposed to be the first
black president according to Tony
Remember that? Yeah.
Yeah. I remember trying to I was
teaching it was like 2017. I was
teaching some graduate students actually
and I was trying to I I had them read
that. It was actually in the New Yorker,
I think, that piece, that Tony Morrison
piece about Bill Clinton being the first
black president
and they could not get their minds
that would not make sense to them. But,
you know, I think that um part of the
reason that the high wokeness on race in
has ebbed somewhat is that we were being
asked to believe that blackness is a
truly grievous condition no matter what
your circumstances are, no matter what
your class is. And I think it&#39;s gotten
to the point, and maybe this is wishful
thinking because I also thought this 15
years ago and then social media came and
proved me wrong, but it&#39;s getting to the
point where that that characterization
of blackness is so far from the rather
obvious truth. There are black people
with serious problems. But frankly, most
black Americans are not living that kind
of tragedy. You do not experience
anything worth the name of racism every
day. We&#39;re just living our lives. Racism
is there, but it&#39;s not the the the
grievous thing that somebody like
D&#39;Angelo or somebody like Kendy depicts.
And I think everybody can see it really,
but we were asked to believe for a
couple of years that something frankly
wasn&#39;t true. There was a vast
exaggeration. And the public is only
going to put up with that for so long.
And I think we&#39;ve seen we&#39;ve seen that
Do you remember that New York Times
magazine profile of Robin D&#39;Angelo?
Um, it was pretty it was pretty long and
so I
I skipped it actually. I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t
care yet and so I skipped it. I did not
read that one. No.
Oh, okay. I you know, so the what I was
struck by that, you know, she grew up
very very poor. I think she&#39;s from the
Pacific Northwest,
I remember.
Or at least she was kind of floating
around academic circles kind of later,
you know, as she got a little older.
But, you know, as a child she was really
poor. I mean, I think she talks about
like they were living in their car at
one point, like practically homeless.
And so, this is just my pet theory. I
think she&#39;s deeply racist. I think she,
as a poor white person, has organized
her entire sensibility around the idea
that the only the only people that she
was better than were black people
because she was a poor white person. And
so she&#39;s the racist and she has
projected her own like, you know, just
sort of moral self-organization onto the
rest of the world or the rest of white
people. And it&#39;s it&#39;s a completely
egodriven analysis. Hm.
I&#39;m inclined to think that
she wants the sense of superiority that
you gain from calling yourself a racist
the way she does. Um, saying that racism
is inherent. I just sense that she wants
to be a hero. What makes you think she
wants to feel like she&#39;s better than
others? That&#39;s a genuine That&#39;s a
genuine question. Because I think I
think poor white people
are tend to be tend to be racist against
black people because that it makes them
feel better. I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s
almost like a co it&#39;s a cope as they
would say like they I mean I have I I
see this you know in my own kind of
distant relative. I mean my people are
from the kind of southern Midwest you
know associate with not
What&#39;s that?
I associate what you&#39;re talking about
with the South. Yeah.
Yes. So, so maybe but I I think that
there&#39;s just um I mean you there there&#39;s
a kind of uh reflexive uh even in maybe
in D&#39;Angelo&#39;s case
unconscious obviously not unconscious
because she&#39;s been unpacking it but I
don&#39;t know this is just my armchair
analysis of her is that I think that she
feels the racism within herself or maybe
it&#39;s her family or maybe it&#39;s some you
know a family member that she has t
tense relationships with and is so
guilty about it and the self
flagagillation. She has turned her own
personal self flagagillation into a
Right. Right. Yeah. I would I&#39;d have to
get to know her a little. Not a lot, but
you should. Right. At an airport once,
actually. Weird. Really? Um Yeah. I
think she I think we passed each other
and she gave me this big big jolly smile
because she&#39;s oh, a black guy. I&#39;m going
to smile a lot.
And I was thinking, does she know who I
am? And if so, what&#39;s and what&#39;s the
smile is weird. So, I just kind of
She should have handed you some money
like in the Matt Walsh film.
I keep on trying to see it, but I I
can&#39;t It&#39;s never where I am. And so, I
can&#39;t wait to see it. I did see the
clip, though. I absolutely
Exquisite. Exquisite.
I&#39;m not a I&#39;m not a fan of Matt Walsh. I
don&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing, but um that
movie is very funny.
Once it streams, I&#39;m definitely going to
get a look. But yeah, I think um with
D&#39;Angelo, I&#39; I&#39;d have to get to know
her, but the she&#39;s incapable often of
making sense. And what I find myself
wondering is this, and I especially find
myself wondering it in 2025 as opposed
to 2020, if these sessions that she&#39;s
doing are so crucial, if if those
sessions are work, where is the evidence
of success? I&#39;m not I&#39;m not aware that
she has actually pointed to what kind of
change she&#39;s made in society with these
sessions during her whole career.
Apparently, America still sees with this
naked racism. So, what&#39;s how is what
she&#39;s doing helping? And over the past
six years, what has become different
based on her preaching? And I get the
feeling she would never ask that
question of herself, but that kind of
shows the vacuousness of it all that it
doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect on this
society that she considers herself
taking care of. I don&#39;t get it, you
Yeah. Well, it&#39;s a business model. She
can&#39;t question her business model.
Ultimately, it&#39;s all a brand, right? I
mean, she&#39;s selling her services and
this is unfortunately where where we
are. Everybody&#39;s pedalling and then
protecting their their brand. Well,
okay. I want to I want to uh pivot a
little bit and and and talk about talk
about language. Um so, I recently I I
honestly want your um opinion about
this. I I recently got into a tiff on on
Twitter X whatever um regarding Zoran
mom Donnie. Uh so again, this is and if
anybody missed the memo, this is the
33-year-old uh progressive running for
mayor of New York City. He&#39;s looking
pretty much like a shoein. Okay, he&#39;s
he&#39;s a social media uh I don&#39;t want to
say genius, but he&#39;s very very good at
social media, which is apparently all
that matters now. Um so he released a
video explaining that he was making a
trip to Uganda to see his family and to
quote celebrate Rama and I&#39;s marriage.
Okay, Rama and I&#39;s marriage. Now, this
is a guy that went to uh the very elite
Bank Street School. He went to the Bronx
High School of Science, I believe, which
is one of the best public schools in the
city. Then he went to elite liberal arts
college, Bowden. I pointed out uh that
Rama and I&#39;s marriage was like not
acceptable. And people went piled on me
and said I was either nitpicking or
totally wrong, that I was wrong, that
that grammar is just fine.
Megan, you know the truth about Rama and
I&#39;s marriage.
That is a kind of a grammar desert in
our language. Exactly what he should
have done. What English wants there? If
you wake up in the middle of the night,
you want to say Rama and Mi&#39;s marriage.
Oh, speak for yourself. Really? I would
wake up in a cold sweat if that was
I mean Rama&#39;s and my marriage is what we
train ourselves to do but no 5-year-old
would say it even if they were a very
fluent speaker. The 5-year-old would say
Rama and me&#39;s marriage. And the reason
for that is that in English the first
person singular pronoun is me. It is not
I. It&#39;s me. And so who broke the lamp?
Me. What? Who&#39;s at the door? It&#39;s me.
That&#39;s what it is. I is something very
special. I is the first person singular
pronoun when it&#39;s right up next to the
verb or separated from it by some
adverb. So I spoke. Billy and me spoke.
That&#39;s the way English has always been.
I actually spoke. Maybe you can stick a
little something in there, but the
pronoun is me. And that&#39;s why we use it
all the time. I is only for that. The
idea that you&#39;re supposed to say Billy
and I went to the store is something
that some people started making up in
the 16 and 1700s because that&#39;s the way
it is in Latin. And back then the idea
was Latin is the best language in the
world. We have to have everything seem
like Latin and ancient Greek. English
doesn&#39;t say Billy and me went to the
store just like Billy and I went to the
store. French doesn&#39;t say Billy and I
went to the store. It would have to be
mwah. That&#39;s what English is like. And
so really it&#39;s Rama and Mi&#39;s marriage.
He&#39;s trying to fix it and very often
people who try to fix it do it wrong and
he&#39;s thinking well you&#39;re supposed to
use I when you feel like using me in
some places. So he says rama and eyes
and gets it wrong just like between you
and I. Which again is somebody thinking
after and you&#39;re supposed to use I but
no that&#39;s not the rule. It should be
between you and me based on these rules
that we&#39;re taught about I being the
subject and me being the object. Megan,
I swear to you that that idea that seems
so intuitive that I is the subject and
me is the object is not the way English
has ever worked. It&#39;s a hoax that we&#39;re
supposed to say Billy and I went to the
store. I write about this in a certain
amount of detail, although entertaining
detail in my latest book, Pronoun
Trouble, because no linguist has ever
really laid the case out. But the reason
that everybody but you deep deep deep
down wants to say Billy and me went to
the store is because it&#39;s it&#39;s the way
English works. Does that make any sense?
But yes, but I feel like they want us
deep down they want to say me and Billy
went to the store. That&#39;s better.
That&#39;s what the 5-year-old wants to say.
And so Mum Donnie is trying he&#39;s
he&#39;s doing the thing where you put the
other person first.
I mean that&#39;s the sort of polite thing,
right? Like his instinct is like I don&#39;t
say it&#39;s not me and Billy. It&#39;s it&#39;s
Billy and and me and then they say I
I don&#39;t know. It just I just uh
How would you have liked my and Rama&#39;s
Yeah. Right. He knows not to say that
because you put the other person first.
He&#39;s not five anymore. But he still
can&#39;t quite get all the way there. Can
you imagine if Tanahazi Kot&#39;s book was
called Between the World and I?
That would be really a shame.
Your whole career would be different.
You could This is the absolute
convergence of all your obsessions
between the world and I.
Between the world and I but okay, but I
just feel like this is such a gaff. And
if you&#39;re making a video like you&#39;re
it&#39;s he you&#39;re editing it. He could have
redone it like this. He&#39;s not just
speaking extemporaneously.
You know, to be honest, I avoid and my
completely because there&#39;s really
there&#39;s no way to do it that sounds
right given one how we&#39;re taught about I
and me and then this issue of the order.
I just try to phrase it in a different
way. But, you know, social media genius,
he&#39;s trying to seem spontaneous. He&#39;s
just, you know, talking the way he
talks. And even as an educated person,
those sorts of things are going to
happen. Especially with and me. That is
a nasty little area of our grammar.
All right, so I want you to weigh in on
another pet peeve of mine, which is
I feel like I I hear like serious media
figures saying this
in earnest. Anyways, anyways, is this
now acceptable?
Boy, that is really on the line. It is
colloquial.
I didn&#39;t know one was using it formally.
But then again, these days, what&#39;s
formal? You know, that whole sense of
there being a context where certain
things are unsayable, that&#39;s largely
falling apart. And I&#39;m sure there are
people saying anyways on NPR.
Walter Kronite would never have said it,
but he&#39;s dead.
He would have said any who,
you know, any who goes actually way
back. It&#39;s actually it&#39;s older than you
think. um
it&#39;s colloquial and nowadays it&#39;s
considered approachable to use
colloquial language even in formal
circumstances and so I&#39;m not surprised
to know that it&#39;s being found in places
where you would never have heard it in
1960 but collo colloquially it&#39;s quite
common you want to say anyways in the
way that you say sometimes you know
anyways that you try to make things feel
the same and so that&#39;s the sort of thing
that a language is going to drift into
that anyways doesn&#39;t make sense, but it
feels kind of right because it&#39;s that
same kind of um I&#39;m not going to use the
linguistics term, but it&#39;s that same
kind of adverb as sometimes. So
sometimes we did this. Anyways, it&#39;s not
going to work. It just feels kind of
right. I can imagine saying anyways. I
don&#39;t, but I can imagine saying it.
So you obviously don&#39;t listen to a lot
of podcasts because podcasters say this
all the time. Do they really? People
Yes. Ser serious journalists who are
like you know not children adults people
been around for a long time who&#39;ve been
writing who have you know established
their careers as writers on the printed
page we&#39;ll say anyways
it&#39;s colloquial yeah it&#39;s it sounds
approachable I guess you&#39;re trying to
sound like a real person
sometimes something gets so common that
you have to just accept it as an
alternate I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true
anyways yet but yeah it&#39;s colloquial I
don&#39;t say it
so It&#39;s a way of making people feel less
intimidated by you.
It&#39;s It&#39;s like saying, &#34;I went to
college in Boston, so you don&#39;t say
Harvard.&#34; And then therefore completely
imit intimidate the person you&#39;re
speaking to as if so they&#39;re going to
faint. Uh that&#39;s my feeling.
Would you say, just to give you a sense
of how random these things can be, let&#39;s
take the word um stupid. We&#39;re not
calling anybody stupid. Let&#39;s just use
it. Would you say more stupid or
I&#39;d say is that correct? I&#39;d there is no
correct. I would say more stupid.
Stupider to me sounds like something
somebody&#39;s making up, but not to you.
And there&#39;s no reason that I&#39;m right.
Sometimes it&#39;s just alternate.
I feel like if I was going to say
stupid, I would be sort of being ironic
to begin with, right?
So saying I might even say more stupider
just to own it, just to lean into the
whole thing because none of it is
Let&#39;s try putrid.
more putrid or putrid.
I feel like putrid is already strong
enough. Do you really need to, you know,
say like that is the putridist?
But you would.
Could you get to that?
Actually, I could get
putrid and putist.
Put not put
to dumb and dumber. Putrid dumber. These
things can be really liinal as they say.
Um, so yeah, they&#39;re they&#39;re fuzzy parts
of the language. Kind of like, you know,
Rama Rama or Rama. Rama, Rama and I&#39;s
Rama and Rama.
Rama and I&#39;s wedding.
Raise marriage.
It&#39;s it&#39;s just a mess.
Um, okay. So, here&#39;s another one that I
can&#39;t stand. Based off
instead of based on.
I do not like that one. And I started
hearing that from my students at
Colombia in the late based off of what
he&#39;s saying. And I&#39;m always thinking,
no, it&#39;s based on
I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s new, but I
certainly hear it hear it. I perceive it
more among the younger folk. And
frankly, objectively, it&#39;s just that
pronouns have a way of fading in and
out. There&#39;s nothing wrong with based
off, but I must admit it it feels a
little crude to me. Kind of like waiting
online. You&#39;re supposed to be in line,
but these are arbitrary distinctions.
waiting online. Uh I did not notice that
until I mean so I was a kid. We moved to
New Jersey when I was about nine and I
did not start on I did not notice I I
remember I started noticing online
waiting online after we got to New
Jersey. So before that we were in Texas.
Yeah. You would have waited in line down
there. That&#39;s right.
Exactly. Yeah.
But I don&#39;t What is that about?
Um random prepositional differences.
It&#39;s just it&#39;s just there. um similar
I&#39;m waiting for Carla I&#39;m waiting on
Carla black and also southern and oh
these things just happen is it for is it
on why is one thing better and that&#39;s
just you know there there are alternates
there are places where the language
flips and so that&#39;s what a lot of these
things are sometimes there sometimes
people say things just wrong like for
example my mother who was a very
articulate woman with a PhD um she grew
up in the deep South. But this this
wasn&#39;t this. For some reason, she had
two words that she just said wrong.
Grocery. She pronounced it grey and
nursery was nursery. She did not have
strange teeth. There was no defect. She
just did not pronounce those two words
right. And by the time I was about
eight, I realized that&#39;s not alternate.
It&#39;s not southern. It&#39;s not black. It&#39;s
just wrong. And that&#39;s because nobody
else says grow. But if every second
person said grocery, if every second
person said anyways, then you have to
have room for thinking that they&#39;re just
alternatives. But you know, beyond a
certain point, you have to allow it. But
if nobody else is doing it or if it&#39;s
just three people, then there&#39;s reason
to say that this is just this is
mistaken. So it&#39;s a
I feel like if you say I&#39;m waiting on
somebody, that implies that they&#39;re late
or you need them to hurry up. Like it&#39;s
annoy there&#39;s an annoyance to it to me.
I&#39;m waiting for somebody. It&#39;s like yeah
they&#39;re not I&#39;m waiting for them.
They&#39;re not here yet. I&#39;m waiting on the
It&#39;s like
I&#39;m waiting on you know Tik Tok.
Yeah. I&#39;m waiting on Bill means I&#39;m
assuming Bill is coming right now and if
he&#39;s not it&#39;s a problem, right? As
opposed to I&#39;m waiting for Bill.
Yeah. It&#39;s it it&#39;s a you&#39;re kind of put
out. Yeah.
If you&#39;re waiting on somebody.
So it kind of lends a nuance actually.
So some people would say why did you say
waiting on? The truth is it isn&#39;t
exactly the same as wait for. Yeah.
Right. Okay. And in speaking of wait
for, you recently wrote uh in your in
your New York Times newsletter about a
looutution used by a Supreme Court
justice uh Katani Brown uh Jackson in
her in her descent
uh Trump.
Good transition.
Dasa, wait for it. Right.
Okay. I did not realize she did this. So
I guess in her descent she wrote uh she
wrote to the majority the power- hungry
actors are wait for it the district
Seriously?
Yes. I like it. I mean talk about formal
language and our changing sense of where
colloquial language is useful. I like
the idea that we can use the nuances of
colloquial language. Like for example, I
imagine you&#39;re not supposed to say wait
on in Supreme Court language. And yet
notice we have figured out that it has a
nuance that probably in some languages
they&#39;re completely different verbs for.
Well, we would say, well, we don&#39;t have
that because we just say wait. But no,
with on and for there&#39;s a use. Well,
that whole issue of wait for it is a
nuance in how you make an argument. And
I imagine there&#39;s some Latinate way of
saying it, but the more effective one is
to say wait for it. And so I enjoy those
those little introjections. I mean, if
you read the entire thing, which of
course I didn&#39;t, but I looked at the
entire thing. She&#39;s quite fluent in
legal language and legal reasoning. It&#39;s
one of the dullst things I&#39;ve ever read,
as all of those sorts of things are. But
she peppered it with things that a real
person might say because she&#39;s just a
little over 50 and she has grown up in a
world where language is not what Walter
Kankite knew. And I think I think people
were giving her an unduly hard time.
Now, the substance of it, people smarter
than me might argue that she didn&#39;t
understand the case. I missed that from
what I read. I read it enough to see
that she seemed to have full
understanding of the arcane contours of
the point, but she used a little
humanity. And I I I don&#39;t think that
that suggested that she was a DEI hire.
Um, I think that she&#39;s just putting her
personhood into the opinions that she
writes. Do you not do you do you not
like that?
Um, I just I I don&#39;t know. I I look I&#39;m
a I&#39;m a real pearl clutcher about a lot
of things. I am a prude. I am a proud
Um, and so no, I don&#39;t like it. I mean,
I get she&#39;s bringing her whole self to
work is what she&#39;s doing, right? She&#39;s
bringing her whole self to the descent.
And it also it says a lot about her
clerks. I mean, do these I don&#39;t know
how much actual writing of these
descents the the justices do. I mean,
obviously they it&#39;s on their watch and
they probably a draft or something. Yes,
she she signed off on it. So, yeah.
Um I don&#39;t know. So, I mean, it seems to
me that so much of the way language is
evolving now is because we are speaking
more than we&#39;re writing. I mean, we are
I mean, we are out of a written word
culture. Uh arguably, I would say we&#39;re
not even in an audio culture anymore.
probably three years ago I would have
said that we were but now it&#39;s like
you&#39;re right
we&#39;re a video short video culture God
help us.
So do you think that this has um this is
all these changes have kind of like sped
up just because we&#39;re not really reading
print printed words anymore as much as
speaking and listening.
I would not be at all surprised because
yes there has been a huge cultural shift
on this and particularly the last 10
years. And so, for example, I do a
language podcast called Lexicon Valley.
I&#39;ve done it now for goodness sake 9
years. So, it started in 2016. I was
first asked to do it in 2010. And what I
said back then was podcast. Why would I
want to talk when I could write? And
that really felt right to me. I just I
couldn&#39;t imagine, you know, yakking and
making these recordings. And then I
started doing it. And actually, it was
in 2020, not only was there the racial
reckoning, but in 2020, I used to turn
down almost every, no offense, but
almost every offer to do podcasts
because I thought, I&#39;m a writer. I want
the permanence of writing and then I
want to go read a book. I don&#39;t want to
go talk. And I realized in 2020, if I
don&#39;t talk, I&#39;m not in the game. I have
to change this. I if Sam Harris was the
first thing I officially did, I had
turned him down twice. And then finally,
I realized, no, I have to talk. And so
that&#39;s when I started doing things like
this. Now I&#39;m used to it. But yeah,
you&#39;re right. Now it&#39;s also it&#39;s all
video. And so we&#39;re all doing these
little these little TV shows and it does
mean it&#39;s clear to me from people I&#39;ve
known for over this time. They don&#39;t
read as much as they used to and not in
as big chunks. I&#39;ve known very many
people where once Twitter really caught
on in particular and then podcast, they
do that instead of picking up a book.
And that that&#39;s I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
going to change. And so that is part of
why you it&#39;s more you you think now
somebody puts weight for it in a
descent. Nobody would have done that 20
years ago, but it was a very different
economy 20 years ago in terms of how
people get their information. We&#39;re an
oral culture now and now oral with the
picture. I hadn&#39;t thought about the
picture until now. But yeah, it&#39;s we&#39;re
it&#39;s Tik Tok now and podcast with
pictures. Yeah.
Yeah. No, I mean I mean you had to come
around to you know talking on you know
sort of a audible audio medium but yeah
no the video thing I mean I was told in
no uncertain terms about a year and a
half ago that if you don&#39;t do video
nobody your your show is not going to
grow like it is simply you&#39;re shooting
yourself in the foot even if nobody
watches it on video. I mean a lot of
people watch YouTube they they consume
through YouTube even if they&#39;re not
watching it. Yeah,
I it&#39;s really when I the Glenn show with
Glenn Lowry that I do, both of us off
camera are always thinking who would
watch this, you know, we&#39;re thinking why
can&#39;t we just
as you know I I I watched it for a long
Apparently people actually watch it.
Well, it&#39;s because people have
parasocial relationships. The audience
has parasocial relationship with the
with the people, right? So like they
they want to know like oh why what&#39;s
your background? Like where are where
are you sitting? What room are you where
is this person? Why are they wearing a
blue shirt today? And why you know this
is and I think this is probably a co
thing too is that people&#39;s entire sense
of themselves and relationship to the
world got reduced to like a zoom zoom
Exactly. Exactly.
I&#39;ve never watched a podcast. I&#39; I
listen to maybe one and a half of them,
but I would not want to watch it because
I don&#39;t get it. But I&#39;m I&#39;m just I guess
I&#39;m becoming a lite in that way. Well, I
want to talk to you about the Glenn show
because you&#39;ve been talking with Glenn,
I think since like 2007 on Talking Heads
Yeah. We were different people. It was
so long ago. Yeah.
Right. And then I think the official
Glenn show started around 2012. It&#39;s a
really long time.
Um, so you two have diverged somewhat. I
mean, Glenn is famous for steel manning
his arguments. Um, so sometimes it&#39;s
hard to know if you if you&#39;re not paying
close attention, you can maybe think
that he&#39;s advocating for something or
when he&#39;s really just embodying the
position of, you know, his an an
adversary.
He&#39;s so good at that. Yeah.
Yes. Um, and which must make him a great
a great teacher. But so his um I don&#39;t
want to say his his ex acceptance of
Trump occasionally veering into
enthusiasm for for Trump and Trump&#39;s
policies is is notable and I wonder how
how you&#39;ve handled that. like what is it
like for you to have been having these
conversations with him for all these
years and do do you feel like there&#39;s
sort of a a a notable fork in the road?
No. Um,
the Trump thing between us is is tough
partly because I know a lot of the
audience hates me because I am just so
utterly dismissive of Trump. I have
given more offense about that than
anything during our whole run talking to
each other to the audience. with Glenn.
I um there are times when I&#39;m perplexed
um at his near enthusiasm for Trump, but
what I see him doing is trying to think
he&#39;s trying to see something in a new
If, and this is a theme we&#39;ve hit a
couple of times over the past year, if
in 20 years it&#39;s possible to write some
hardback book, you know, Sam Tannen
House writes it or something about Trump
making an argument that he actually was
a force for the good, like maybe by
accident or maybe counterintuitively
maybe he&#39;s actually thinking. I don&#39;t
think he does, but to to show that
there&#39;s actual cognition going on and
people like me needed to shut up. I
would find that very stimulating. I
would find that very interesting. I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen with
Trump, but I think that Glenn is hoping
it might and just trying to see
something from a different side. Not to
mention Trump is extremely easy to
despise. And I think that&#39;s partly
because from what I see, literally, he
has not a single redeeming feature. I
mean, he used to be pleasant to look at,
but frankly, he has not a single
redeeming feature that I can see. But
that means that um someone like me can
just, you know, throw that paint at the
wall. He&#39;s in a way doing more work. And
I I get it. I get it. It still perplexes
me a little, but this is this is going
to be the snoody kind of thing that
makes people who watch that show not
like me. But frankly, you know, he um I
would think Glenn would be too
intelligent to truly be a fan of Trump,
who I think is really stupid. I mean,
really low IQ person. But, you know,
life is more interesting if you when
it&#39;s counterintuitive. So, no, I have
not thought of it as a problem. I think
Glenn has because I&#39;ve really offended
the audience a lot, but I I haven&#39;t.
I&#39;m surprised that the audience would
lean that heavily proTrump.
I was a little surprised. I didn&#39;t know
that there were that many of them who
liked Trump that much. I insult them by
saying that he&#39;s stupid, you know,
because and I understand it. If you&#39;re a
fan of Trump, then listening to me, it
sounds like I&#39;m insulting you. And but
yeah, I I find Trump easy. It&#39;s just
I I think the people who comment on
podcasts are the most especially on our
podcast like like you&#39;re it&#39;s going to
overindex for the more conservative
people. Yeah. Because they found their
way there,
right? The the hot opinions and things
and they argue with each other. I don&#39;t
actually read the comments, but Glenn
tells me about things that are going on
and from what I&#39;ve heard.
Yeah. No, I think you&#39;re right. I think
that he I mean, he&#39;s it&#39;s almost like
he&#39;s he&#39;s not allowing himself to
indulge in um whatever visceral response
he might have to to to Trump. He&#39;s
really being a pretty disciplined
debater. Like he&#39;s thinking like a
lawyer in a certain way
and you have to respect that. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, and uh, I mean I was I I
I I interviewed him for the podcast
about his memoir, which I just thought
was like so fascinating to read and then
talk about. I mean, he does, if anybody,
you know, listens to that interview,
like he has an incredible ability to
detach his his emotional experience from
from the facts on the ground, but yet
also synthesize them and be accountable
for them. So, it&#39;s it&#39;s really
something.
It&#39;s funny. I actually
I find his having written the memoir
harder to wrap my head around than his
approach to Trump because I would never
want to share those things with the
world. Yeah. If if that had been the way
my life went. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m
going to share what has happened to me
with the world because I just figure why
would anybody want to know andor there
are some things I&#39;d rather take to the
grave. And so I I don&#39;t know that that
is something that I find fascinating
about Glenn that he wrote that um much
more fascinating than how he feels about
about the current president.
Yeah. So actually that&#39;s a great thing I
would love to talk about for a second
here because I also the older I get the
less I want to say about my life. I mean
I&#39;ve been writing books
about you know about the world through
the lens of my experience for many
decades now. The older I get, the less
interested I am in talking about that
stuff. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because, you
know, when you&#39;re young, you think that
everything you do, you think that you&#39;re
the only person who&#39;s experienced the
world in this way ever, ever. You know,
it&#39;s that kind of um sort of, you know,
cl exuberant cluelessness kind of thing
as I sometimes call it. And I wonder if
somebody, you know, somebody like Glenn
who he doesn&#39;t he he&#39;s he hasn&#39;t done
that kind of writing. Like he&#39;s an
economist. Like his output has been it&#39;s
it&#39;s been narrowly focused on things
external to him. Mhm.
Um, you know, and I and so to do
something like write a memoir like that,
it&#39;s enough of a novelty that you&#39;re
you know, maybe you&#39;re just you&#39;re
you&#39;re you&#39;re not as as automatically
sensitive to like you&#39;re you don&#39;t have
so much of an ego around it in a strange
way. Like the novelty is outweighing the
Yeah, I I I get that. And I and I say I
don&#39;t want to write a memoir, but
frankly, if you somebody were forced to
read every column I&#39;ve ever written,
they would get my memoir because I write
about myself and my past all the time.
It&#39;s just I wouldn&#39;t want to do it all
in one go. But yeah, I&#39;m sure that for
Glenn, it felt like doing something very
different from what he&#39;s done before.
And yeah, it was quite quite a read, but
still I was call it brave. Put it that
Oh gosh, I hate that. I hate that.
calling calling somebody brave is like
uh you know cliche
that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the most
backhanded compliment you can give to a
as if to to like a memoist or somebody
like I can&#39;t calling them brave is like
I can&#39;t believe you
I can&#39;t believe you did that
no because in his case
mortified I know in his case
a lot of the things that he did you know
which he&#39;s putting out there he&#39;s
risking being disliked
you know a person could go through it
and especially frankly a woman could go
through it and think I don&#39;t like this
guy and it doesn&#39;t make it any better
that he&#39;s over 70 and looking back he
did those things. I don&#39;t come away from
it feeling that, but there&#39;s a risk in
that, right,
with a book like that.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, how do you
feel about writing about yourself as you
get older? You&#39;re not a memoirist.
Obviously, you write about stuff in the
world, but you you do weave your own
experience into things. Does it feel
different to write about, say, being a
professor, being just a man in the world
as somebody in his 50s as opposed to
somebody in his 20s or 30s? Um, I always
feel like
it&#39;s funny. I&#39;m maybe I&#39;m sounding like
I think I&#39;m so unique the way you&#39;re
saying people do when they&#39;re younger,
but my me when I write memoiristic
things like when I was a kid this or
when I was a kid that, my thought is
usually and in this it was odd. And so I
write about my middle class upbringing.
And I always have to specify leafy
middle class very integrated
neighborhood because everybody quite
understandably will think I either grew
up in the ghetto and made it out or then
the other vision people have is that
maybe I was extremely bour fresh prince
of bair the um the pcal ever book that
made into a novel last summer whose name
I can never remember. American
Oh American fiction but that was but
eraser was the name of the novel.
Right. Right. American fiction. And I
didn&#39;t grow up in that either. Just
leave it to Beaver. That&#39;s not what
people expect of a black upbringing,
especially one as far back as the 60s
and 70s. And then if I write about being
a professor, all of it has been
eccentric. Like I never had to give a
job talk at Colombia. I kind of fell
into it by accident. I do a kind of
linguistics that&#39;s a little bit odd
compared to what most linguists do.
Nobody knows what linguistics is. My
life has just been very serendipitous
and and peculiar. And so when I write a
memoir, I&#39;m always thinking one more
thing about me that&#39;s bizarre. You know,
knowing everybody in the cast of some
musical in 1926, you know, that that
sort of thing. And so for me, I&#39;m
writing about those things, but I&#39;m
generally thinking, I&#39;ve got to make
sure people realize that it&#39;s not what
they might think. I have never known the
rules of football. I don&#39;t know what a
down is. I have not held a basketball in
my hands since I was about 17. and I
don&#39;t anticipate ever doing so again
except maybe to move one out of my way.
You know, I&#39;m weird. I&#39;m just I&#39;m weird.
And so that&#39;s part of the reason I don&#39;t
want to write a memoir because I think
people would be waiting for something
educational or something uplifting and
all they would get is just one weird
thing happening after another. Like for
example, the bungalow colony that I&#39;m
sitting here doing this from this
ramshackle wonderful little cabin.
You&#39;ve been up here. What am I doing up
here with all these Jewish people? You
know, it&#39;s it&#39;s weird. I love it here
though, you know, that that sort of
So, it&#39;s just weird.
It&#39;s a great It&#39;s It&#39;s a It&#39;s a great
colony. We have many mutual friends
there, which is why I&#39;ve been there. And
but it&#39;s very rustic. So, my my hat is
off to you. Uh you don&#39;t have to you are
not in a in a in a station in life where
you would have to
that is this way.
And sometimes I think why am I doing
this instead of you know spending some
money and going some fancy place? then
it wouldn&#39;t be the social colony that
this is which you&#39;ve seen. And so yeah,
that that sort of thing. What do you do
with your summer and it&#39;s going to some
cabin which is like from Mrs. Masel or
or Dirty Dancing and that actually still
exists. But yeah, it&#39;s just my life is
of a Broadway Danny Rose. Uh
I forgot about that. That&#39;s right.
Oh yes, exactly. Um well I you know
before we wrap up here I mean I&#39;m always
interested in talking with people who
are you know established in the way that
you are and sort of your generation and
somebody who&#39;s you know really a part of
the the cultural conversation and the
zeitgeist and you you&#39;ve been
functioning as a public intellectual for
many decades now.
The and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a loathome
phrase public intellectual. I mean it&#39;s
kind of an obviously
we don&#39;t use we don&#39;t use it with each
other right but yeah
no I call myself a a semi-public quasi
intellectual that that&#39;s that&#39;s what I
am but um uh you know that job has
changed you know it used to there was a
real accountability to it like to call
even the notion of an intellectual I
mean for me that it&#39;s like somebody who
was deeply and widely read somebody who
knew like a lot about a lot of stuff but
deeply about a lot of stuff and who had
published in a serious way. There was a
certain gatekeeping. Yes. Involved.
There were benchmarks you had to hit. It
was very elitist by definition.
Hitchens Christopher Lash. Yeah. That
I mean William F.Buckley whatever like
this this world, right? And um we&#39;re now
in a time when anybody could pick up a
microphone and say whatever they want.
And there is a segment of the new media
sphere that um advertises itself as like
where the real intellectuals are. You
know, I&#39;m not talking even I mean Joe
Joe I&#39;m not even talking about Joe Rogan
necessarily. He is Sue generous but
there&#39;s a world of people supposedly
being very smart about a lot of things.
And there&#39;s a world of people who were
the dissenters um the intellectual dark
web that was the sort of early coinage
um and that it&#39;s really splintered and I
mean I have there are people I have
observed over the last decade say that I
was like a real fan of who have now just
disappointed is not even the world word
like baffled me like I I just don&#39;t
understand what&#39;s going on with them and
it makes me think like were they even
that smart to begin with like I don&#39;t
understand how this evolution has
occurred and I know you don&#39;t listen to
a lot of podcasts so maybe you can&#39;t
really answer this but I just wonder how
you feel about this whole intellectual
a public intellectual so to speak does
have a certain responsibility to the
extent that I associate myself with that
category which consciously I don&#39;t walk
around doing but I consider it my job to
try to read widely and to have
principles that make sense and that I
try to espouse but to also understand
that sometimes you have to change your
If I catch your meaning, certainly the
gatekeepers would not have allowed a
Brett Weinstein to acquire the pulpit
that he has say 30 years ago. He would
have to, you know, he would have to put
out a zen or something or maybe he would
Well, that would do it. I don&#39;t think
that would do it. You mean staple staple
something together
or he would be on public access in one
city or something like that.
He would be on channel J or something.
But now that is that is not the case.
And we both know there are many people
like that. The truth is though that I
like the challenge from people like
that. I I prefer them in writing or I I
see them on Twitter X or whatever rather
than listening to the podcast because
I&#39;d rather read a book. But few
generally those people are not utterly
wrong. They have something to say. They
might make you think of something. And
so in this John Stewart Mill sense, I
like that those people exist. But yeah,
there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of crap
out there and you have to kind of wade
through it. The gatekeepers were highly
elitist and there was an awful lot that
you ended up missing. But it did mean
that, you know, Joe Rogan quote unquote
just asking questions and some of the
questions are a little scary and some of
the people are a little scary. That
person would at best have had a local
radio program late at night back in the
day. He wouldn&#39;t have been
Well, that was the Rush Li. I mean,
wasn&#39;t just asking questions was kind of
a Glenn Beckism. I feel like even before
Rogan. Well,
I forgot about him. And yeah, I mean,
there were the AM
I mean, I think part of the reason that
I love podcasts is because I loved
radio. I loved talk radio. I loved like
late night AM call-in radio. And this is
kind, you know, this is the new
iteration of that. But yeah, but the
just asking questions, you&#39;re right. I
mean, this is the absolutely like most
diluted form of of intellectual inquiry,
right? Like it is, you know,
but you know, that&#39;s that is a an
approach that many human beings have to
information and now it&#39;s just
represented more accessibly than it used
to be. But yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s complicated
these days. I I&#39;ve been doing this long
enough now. I&#39;ve been quote unquote a
public intellectual for 25 years now and
so I definitely remember a different era
and it was harder to get out there
definitely but then on the other hand
there was less there was less swill
there was less static to deal with it it
felt easier to position yourself and to
take in the proper information there&#39;s a
lot it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot harder now
somebody like Susan S tag if she were at
her in her prime today if she were like
an exciting young public intellectual in
her 40s. Do you think she would have a
But it&#39;s interesting. I don&#39;t think she
would acquire the following today that
she had then because she was the kind of
public intellectual who was hoping to
make you look beyond yourself and
stretch. And so she&#39;s seeing foreign
films at a time when the ordinary
American intellectual didn&#39;t see as
many. She&#39;s pointing to novels that you
probably never would have read. And she
is working on ideas that you have to
strain to capture. She was making you
reach up. I remember when there were
more famous writers who did that. Even
Crazy Gorvidal was good at that as was
William F. Buckley. There&#39;s less impulse
for that now. the idea is for you to
kind of just reach right out in front of
you. I think that even our intellectual
culture doesn&#39;t challenge you as much as
it used to. Like, God bless The
Atlantic, for example, and I still read
it from cover to cover, but in order to
survive, The Atlantic now has to put out
a lot more short form pieces where you
don&#39;t have to reach as much as you had
to. And that&#39;s not to criticize The
Atlantic, it&#39;s just that&#39;s the way it
is. Um or remember when the New York
Times book review had like 20 or 25 a
week and now much much less the culture
has changed. So no I mean in all of her
brilliance and even her glamour
I don&#39;t think she would have the
purchase today that she had back then.
I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of glad that she came along
when she did because she would fight for
attention in this culture unless frankly
she kind of dumbed it down which she
absolutely would not have wanted to do.
You think she would not have? You don&#39;t
think she would have been savvy enough
to say like, &#34;Okay, well, this is I
gotta I gotta do something.&#34;
I think she was just too brilliant and
too too impatient and didn&#39;t suffer
fools gladly. I think she would have
just done what she did and just traveled
in much smaller circles. I don&#39;t think
she would be as much of a celebrity
today. There wouldn&#39;t be enough there.
There isn&#39;t enough room. There isn&#39;t as
much room for someone like her today as
there was then. That&#39;s my sense of it.
Wow. Yeah. Well, I&#39;m glad. Aren&#39;t you
Aren&#39;t you kind of glad that you have
lived when you did? Not that we&#39;re we&#39;re
still alive, but you know, like I always
say, I don&#39;t like getting older, but I&#39;m
so glad that I got to experience like
the &#39;9s. Like the 1990s was a great time
to be a writer and a thinker.
What What an interesting In the 90s, I
was still a full-time linguist and that
was really all I was doing. I I got
started in the as this a good time. Um
because the internet puts so much
information at your fingertips. You
don&#39;t have to go to a library.
And also with media, especially with
first with with how much you could put
on a DVD and then streaming, you can see
everything. You&#39;ve got everything in
your pocket. You don&#39;t have to go to a
film festival. that gives you access to
an awful lot of art, frankly, just that
I can have any movie I want by just
pressing a button. That&#39;s an amazing
time to have lived in. Um, yeah. Yeah.
But the Iraq War, The Great Awakening,
am I happy to have been around during
those times? Frankly, the Great
Awakening was good for my career, but I
think it sounds petty for me to say I&#39;m
glad I was around to take advantage of
it. But it was 2020 was a very
interesting time to write about race as
was the Obama era. I can definitely say
Okay. But I guess I mean I am glad that
I got to that I got my start before the
internet literally like before social
media like I got to come of age at a
time where if you had something in the
New Yorker that meant something.
That must have been a real blast. Yeah.
Um because there isn&#39;t that sense of
drama today in it. You mean the print
error? I caught I caught the tail end of
that. Yeah.
Right. And and just that I was able to
think in private and make certain
mistakes without it being captured
forever on the internet. Like I wrote
some really stupid pieces early in my
career that you can&#39;t find because they
were only in print,
And they haven&#39;t followed me around
forever. Whereas I wrote a piece called
How Hip Hop Holds Blacks Back, which was
not my title. I wrote it for City
Journal, the Manhattan Institute&#39;s
Oregon, back when I thought of it as
just something that you hold in your
hands and that a few conservatives would
read and put in the trash. Myin Magnet,
the editor of it, um who is a horrid
little person, worst person I&#39;ve met in
all of my years in New York, he um
mangled it in editing into I wrote a
nuanced piece trying to make a point. He
mangled it into me standing on the lawn
and telling the kids to get off of my
grass and made it this anti- rap vaguely
racist screed. I decided I would never
write for him again. But because I was
under contract, I thought I&#39;m going to
let this run because, you know, 5,000
people are going to read it and then
it&#39;s going to be in the trash. And I
thought nobody will have any access to
it outside of a few libraries. I didn&#39;t
know that. Now things were online as of
that spring. That damn thing went all
over the world. People are still asking
me about it today. It will never go
away. And I try to explain here and
there that I essentially didn&#39;t write
that piece, but it can only do so much.
Yes, that&#39;s annoying. It would have been
better to be able to write something and
have it be forgotten. That&#39;s harder now.
Yeah. Yeah, it&#39;s hard. Well, um, John,
thank you so much for doing this
interview. I know you don&#39;t do a lot of
them, so I&#39;m I&#39;m really grateful. And
thank you, by the way, for agreeing to
participate in our, uh, Unspeak Easy
weekend that&#39;s coming up in October.
11th and 12th. That&#39;s right. You are one
of our speakers and it doesn&#39;t even this
requires no preparation because this is
like this is a real experiment. I don&#39;t
think anybody has tried anything like
this before. I haven&#39;t. It&#39;s um it&#39;s a
it&#39;s a small gathering for big ideas or
we&#39;re going to have maybe I don&#39;t know
and 45 attendees small group lot of
speakers and I will have a conversation
with you and and some others and then
that it will it will quickly um open up
into a larger discussion with everybody
not just an audience Q&amp;amp;A but like a like
a real kind of living room discussion
all off the record nothing recorded
everything in there. We have people
coming from all over the country. Um uh
it&#39;s super exciting. People people can&#39;t
wait. So
that is it is in my calendar.
Definitely.
Okay. I uh I&#39;m I&#39;m really grateful and
I&#39;m super excited. So um thank you. Is
there anything we got since this is a
podcast, we got to do the calls to
action. Is there anything that you want
to tell the folks about where they can
find you other than at the Bungalow
Colony which you&#39;re not going to give
the address. So, well, you can find me
pretty much every week um at the New
York Times in my um subscriberonly
newsletter. Sometimes it&#39;s in print. And
um I&#39;m still doing my Lexicon Valley
podcast um on language and that&#39;s always
there. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t tweet much
actually. I&#39;m trying to stay out of
that. I&#39;d rather once again I&#39;d rather
read than than do that. But definitely
getting a sense of where I am is at the
times. Every week I drop on Thursday.
Okay. All right. Well, thank you so much
again and enjoy the rest of your summer.
You too, Megan.
That was my conversation with author,
linguist, and New York Times columnist
John Mcuarter. John was last on the pod
back in May 2021.
That was before we had to do things on
video. Um, it was a great conversation.
I believe he talked about his mother
quite a bit. So, go back and listen to
that if you missed it the first time.
Uh, once again, quick announcement here.
