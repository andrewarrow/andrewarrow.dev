I want to read you an email that I was
asked to keep confidential I&#39;ve been
thinking about this for a long time but
I now believe that reading it to you
will go some way to explain why I&#39;m
worried about the status of scientific
research generally but especially in the
foundations of physics I received this
email about 7 years ago after I
published a comment in nature physics
titled science needs reason to be
trusted in it I explained how I lost
trust in scientific self-correction
after I realized how much of what&#39;s
published in the foundations of physics
is nonsense and continues to be nonsense
this email came from someone who I&#39;ve
met a few times but don&#39;t know in any
depth and who at the time worked at a
top institution in the United States to
honor the request of confidentiality
I&#39;ve removed some details hi zabina I&#39;m
if you remember me I&#39;m not using my work
email the topic is a bit delic and I
hope that our conversation will remain
confidential I&#39;m contacting you
regarding your recent paper in nature
which made a lot of noise first of all
congratulations on a nice paper if you
wanted to attract attention you managed
to do this actually I&#39;d like to ask you
next time think not only about
short-term personal benefits but about
the community in general you understand
what consequences your publication might
bring for our community what are all
these BSM model Builders with
exaggerated self-opinion going to do
afterwards what about experimentalists
who survive hiding inside big multi-v
collaborations can you offer them all
any decent employment Alternatives some
of them have families and young children
some of them are already too old to get
employment elsewhere for some of them
Academia is the only way to get US Visa
if you like yes what we created is a
bubble but it has helps thousands of
those guys and their families not to die
from Hunger we all do the same stuff and
have some trade secrets for example I&#39;m
one of the authors of the so-called
model pretty useless stuff old
refurbished with a couple of new blows
and whistles but if people buy this and
it helps them to get grants who cares
for people who pay us all we do is just
noise they have zero idea that
Elementary particles exist they pay us
from public funds not from their own and
basically pay for something cool some
new crazy hype which they need either to
include into their sence spending
reports or in case of universities to
attract students your paper made a lot
of noise and most likely will affect
redistribution of Hep funds towards
other areas but I doubt that you&#39;ll be
able to suggest and Implement any
organizational changes also any changes
of quality criteria which would
demonstrate uselessness of somebody&#39;s
work will have zero chance of approval I
understand that all what I wrote above
might sound a bit harsh sorry for this
but this is how our society is built and
this is not only a problem in the Hep
Community but also exists in all other
areas my heart is bleeding when I
regularly see brightened intelligent
persons with independent ways of
thinking leaving Academia or getting
kicked out whereas obedient idiots
remain but there&#39;s nothing can do those
who get kicked out usually find better
opportunities outside of Academia those
who remain in Academia accept the rules
and enjoy the comfort of academic life
of course sometimes there are exceptions
like string theorists smolen and white
but I doubt you&#39;d like to share their
Destiny I&#39;m reading this to you as an
illustration a rare example of somebody
else&#39;s honest
words I can&#39;t prove Pro to you that this
email is real so you&#39;ll have to take my
word for it in contrast to the person
who sent this email I don&#39;t think that
taxpayers are stupid we&#39;re not paying
physicists for crazy new hype we want to
see results and soon taxpayers will
start asking some tough questions an
example so they told you that this Dune
experiment that&#39;s being built from some
billions dollars of public funds at firb
will tell us why we exist exist or why
the universe didn&#39;t disappear I regret
to inform you that it won&#39;t do any such
thing regardless of what the result of
the Dune experiment will be it&#39;ll not
tell us why the universe contains more
matter than antimatter because this
question is impossible to answer within
the context of our current theories the
matter antimatter symmetry that Dune is
supposedly shedding light on is a pseudo
problem it&#39;s a story that physicists
have made up that they&#39;re now selling to
the public because they think that once
they have the money it doesn&#39;t really
matter if they deliver what they
promised though to be fair I think that
some of them are honestly confused about
what CP violation in the nutrius sector
even says about antimatter what will the
experiment do it&#39;ll measure some
properties of neutrinos what&#39;s that good
for is good for keeping particle
physicists employed because some of them
have families and it it be unfair if
they had to do something useful for
their income wouldn&#39;t it and has anyone
even noticed that the US government
spent another 2 billion dollars or so on
a new particle collider at Brook Haven
its purpose is to improve measurements
of the quark and glue and distribution
inside of heavy irons what they good for
you&#39;re not supposed to ask you&#39;re
supposed to believe that you&#39;re too
stupid to understand what it&#39;s good for
but let me fill you in it&#39;s good for
keeping particle physicists employed
meanwhile the Chinese are laughing their
asses off that you think it makes your
country worth defending that particle
physicists have created these bubbles of
useless research is not a problem that
can be fixed from inside the community
the only way to fix the problem is to
stop paying them I&#39;m afraid that this is
exactly what&#39;s going to happen I didn&#39;t
want this to happen this is why I wrote
my 2017 comment but at this point it&#39;s
too late for them to change anything
it I&#39;ve read this email dozens of times
and each time I&#39;m stunned by how
condescending it is to all the people
who do honest work and whose taxes pay
for academic jobs it makes me sick and
it makes me glad that I no longer have
anything to do with this so-called
research area that&#39;s rotten to the core
if you are one of the many physicists
who know full well what nonsense
research I&#39;m talking about but you still
keep your mouth shut if you&#39;re one of
those who laugh about me because No One
Believes what I&#39;m saying if you&#39;re one
of those who spread lies about me like
that story that I was invited to give a
talk at CERN but was afraid to go did
you make that up I hope it was amusing
but Jesus use your brain your
problem isn&#39;t that I&#39;m making noise your
problem is that you&#39;re lying to the
people who who pay you your problem is
that you&#39;re cowards without a shred of
scientific Integrity your problem is
that every bubble eventually bursts by
the way the reason I now call it
nonsense research and no longer
research is that YouTube flexs the
letter as profanity and we don&#39;t want to
be profane on this channel that would be
ABS lutely terrible all right
let me know what you think about all
this in the comments there are many
reasons why you might not want other
people to get your private information
and yes I have reasons this is why
signed up to incog who&#39;ve been
sponsoring this video you see each time
you open a website it&#39;ll try to collect
data about who you are and where you are
and what other websites you&#39;ve visited
if you then sign up for a website and
fill in your personal details they can
and often do make money by selling your
private information to data Brokers most
countries have lost against that and you
can ask for your data to be removed but
doing this takes up a lot of time incog
automates the process of getting you out
of those databases you sign up and
they&#39;ll contact the big Sinners request
that your personal details be removed
they&#39;ll keep on doing that and if you
want send you updates about the progress
they&#39;re making like this recent one I
got that says they&#39;ve gotten me out of
151 databases and saved me 13 hours of
time I&#39;m glad there&#39;s now a simple
solution to stop unfriendly people doing
nasty things with my personal details
incog is super easy to use you sign up
give them the information they should
look for and they go to work like within
a minute basically I now sleep better at
night and maybe I can help you sleep
better too if you use my code zabina or
the custom link in the info below you&#39;ll
get 60% off of in
that&#39;s an amazing deal so go and check
this out thanks for watching see you
