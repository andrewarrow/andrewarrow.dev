A lot of you know this, but I recently
took up the multi-year task of watching
every video game adaptation ever made.
So, every movie based on a video game I
will be watching to find definitively
the best one and the worst one, ranking
them from worst to best. I&#39;ve watched in
total six now, but I&#39;ve only made two
videos on them. One for Silent Hill 2006
and one for Silent Hill Revelations, but
I&#39;ve watched four others. I just haven&#39;t
made any content on them. That&#39;s because
they&#39;re more modern movies, which means
the copyright on them is a little
stricter. So, like when I did Silent
Hill Revelations, that got flagged
pretty hard. Immediately, YouTube came
in with the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] whistle, the hall
monitor badge, and slap the old
copyright claim and block handcuffs on
the on the video. So, for these four, I
don&#39;t think I could make big videos on
each of them. So, instead, I&#39;m just
going to yap about them right here to
your face. So, spread your lats. Get
ready. I&#39;m coming in hot. So, the first
three I did in a batch because I was
just going to make one video for this
entire series of liveaction video game
adaptations. It&#39;s the Tomb Raider
series. I didn&#39;t want to break these up
into individual videos. I thought it
would be better just to do them all in
like a batch. So, let&#39;s start with 2001
Angelina Jolie fronted Tomb Raider. This
movie I actually have pretty fond
memories of because I actually watched
this after coming back from the hospital
and having an eye patch on my eye
because my friend&#39;s dog bit my eyeball.
So I spent the day at the hospital. They
were tending to my wound. They were
performing voodoo magic and dropping,
you know, sacred phoenix down eye drops
in there to fix it all up. And when I
got sent home with an eye patch on, my
dad threw on Tomb Raider and he said,
&#34;We&#39;re going to watch this tonight.&#34; to
date probably still the only time my
father has ever willingly watched a
video game adaptation or anything even
loosely based on a video game. I think
it was just that early 2000&#39;s Angelina
Jolie hype train. So this film is
somewhat sentimental to me and going
back and watching it I can confidently
say it&#39;s fine. Like it&#39;s a fun movie. It
doesn&#39;t do anything super special. It&#39;s
very much a product of its time which I
actually think is a really charming
aspect of it. Everything about this film
wants to be extreme. So like the very
first scene, she&#39;s like hanging upside
down and then fights a robot. And
actually, the robot looks pretty good.
Like this film does have some very bad
CGI moments. I mean, it&#39;s 2001. Of
course, it&#39;s going to have some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
wonkiness. But for the most part, I
actually think this looks better than
most of the old DCU movies from a few
years back, like with the Flash and all
of that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] This film looks pretty
solid overall, and it&#39;s really fun.
She&#39;s using video game moves during her
robot fight. So, she&#39;s doing like back
flips and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] She&#39;s dual wielding and
doing all kinds of like gunfu on it.
It&#39;s like really well choreographed and
it of course tries to suckle from the
teat of the Matrix because I mean it&#39;s
the early 2000s. So, it has like her
dodging bullets and stuff and doing
those kind of maneuvers which really
fits in line with the Lara Croft
character overall. To be honest, I
really think the action in this was a
slapper. I thought it was such a good
thrill ride. Now, the story, you know,
it&#39;s nothing amazing. I was surprised to
see Daniel Craig here, but the story, I
wrote it down. Basically, the bad guys
have a chance at getting a triangle key
or they&#39;ll have to wait 5,000 years
because of planetary alignment cucking
them. And Angelina,
okay, I went out of order cuz I jumped
from like my plot synopsis to Angelina
Jolie wore tit enhancers.
So, I&#39;m jumping around a little bit.
Yeah, Angelina Jolie has like a
quadruple decup here that is extremely
perky. And I looked it up. She wore
booby boosters. She had uh breast
augments like like big padding in order
to more closely resemble the Laura Croft
diamond titties, like the pointed poly
polygon titties. So, that&#39;s worth
mentioning. I thought that that was kind
of wacky that they did that. Uh but
anyway, uh this the plot they need to
get this triangle key. It&#39;s the
Illuminati. The the the organization is
the Illuminati. They need to get this
key in this very strict time frame so
that way they can get the artifact that
will allow them to control time itself.
So they have like a time manipulator
doohickey that they&#39;re trying to get
their their greasy little Illuminati
paws on. And eventually Laura Croft
meets the bad guy and he&#39;s fundamentally
just a a Redditor. He&#39;s like a a
prototype Redditor. All of his lines are
so cringey. Like one of his lines is,
&#34;Your ignorance amuses me. What a
pleasurable torment this shall be.&#34; And
stuff like that. There&#39;s also a side
booby scene with Angelina Jolie, which I
vividly remember being like a big like
wow moment back in the early 2000s. So
that was cool, I guess. But uh yeah,
basically she is trying to stop them
from getting the triangle of light and
controlling time because you don&#39;t want
that power in the bad guy&#39;s hands. So
she is now trying to get the triangle of
light herself. And it is a lot of
action. There&#39;s like a bungee cord fight
in her mansion, which is a really cool
mansion, by the way. And the bungee cord
fight is really cool. Again, I think the
action super slaps. Daniel Craig, like I
mentioned, is here and he&#39;s like a
pseudo love interest of Angelina Jolie,
but he&#39;s working for the bad guys and
he&#39;s also kind of cringe. He is very on
the nose with his exposition. So, he
reveals like the big twist that he&#39;s
been contracted with the Illuminati to
get the triangle of light and he says,
&#34;Lara&#39;s in it for the glory. I&#39;m in it
for the money.&#34; So, that&#39;s his whole
character trait. Money, money, money,
money. He&#39;s Mr. Krabs. It&#39;s not deep.
This film doesn&#39;t even really try to
give you a compelling narrative. And
that&#39;s by far like the worst element of
it. Like it&#39;s fun. Like it&#39;s a fun
adventure. They go a lot of different
places. She solves little puzzles and
riddles, all of which are kind of cool,
but there&#39;s no emotional weight to it.
So Daniel Craig, his name is Alex. At
the end of the film, they&#39;re all
standing off trying to get their hands
on the triangle of light. And in order
to try and force Lara to give over the
triangle of light, the bad guy throws a
knife and kills Alex. And thus it
prompts Laura to get the triangle of
light to reset time so that way she can
save Alex. But you don&#39;t really care
because the relationship between these
two [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sucks. That that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is
flatter than my ass and I have Hank Hill
ass. So by far the worst part of the
film is like its story. It doesn&#39;t
really do much to make any chemistry
between the characters. But overall I
really did enjoy watching it. It is a
fun early 2000s action flick. Now,
moving on to the next Laura Croft Tomb
Raider film. This one&#39;s Cradle of Life.
This one has Gerard Butler. I didn&#39;t
remember him being in this film either,
but this one I think is definitely a
step backwards. I think this one is just
worse in every possible department. The
action&#39;s not nearly as flashy or as
cool, but I don&#39;t think the it is a bad
movie. It&#39;s just definitely worse in
comparison to the first one. So, like in
the very beginning, there&#39;s a CGI rock
avalanche at a wedding and it looks like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] It somehow looks worse than the
first movie. I&#39;m guessing what happened
is for the second film, they thought
maybe they could, you know, cheap out on
the visual effects and maybe just focus
more on star power with having Gerard
Butler here and uh, you know, Angelina
Jolie, but it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t know like
there&#39;s no chemistry between them
either. I guess there&#39;s a little more
between them than her and Alex from the
previous film, who is completely
forgotten, by the way. I don&#39;t think
they even mentioned his name once here.
It&#39;s like he never even existed. They
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] vanished after the triangle of
light brought them back to life. But
yeah, as more and more memories of it
are coming back to me, I watched this
like 2 weeks ago. I wrote everything
down, but as I&#39;m remembering more of it,
it is actually significantly worse than
the 2001 uh Tomb Raider film. Like
there&#39;s this CGI shark where she&#39;s like
swimming to get like this golden ball
and there&#39;s like this CGI shark.
Actually looks like something out of an
indie game from Steam. Pretty like I
don&#39;t know what happened in the visuals
department. I think they maybe they went
on strike or something. They said, &#34;Fuck
it. I&#39;ll have my son finish it. He&#39;s
used Blender once. I don&#39;t know what
went wrong, but yeah, it looks much
worse. Also, the story is a lot worse.
There is still like a grand sense of
adventure that I can appreciate, but it
doesn&#39;t really have as many like
intricate puzzles or anything to solve.
It&#39;s all a lot more like streamlined and
on rails, so it it loses that sense of
scale that the first one kind of had.
And I also hate the villain in this one
even more than the last one. He&#39;s even
more cringe. So this guy is like a
worldrenowned super genius turbo mega
mine galaxy intellect but he uses his
mind for evil. He turns to a life of
crime where he becomes a boweapons
traitor and he he likes to release
poison weapons to the world just to
watch it all burn. So he&#39;s giving like
this speech about how he just likes to
see the effects of his bioweapons, his
virus. It&#39;s like some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out of
Umbrella Corp really. Like, so he&#39;s
giving this speech and he&#39;s talking
about how uh like he released enhanced
Ebola, like super Ebola, and wants to
sell it for a hundred million to some
bad guys. But he doesn&#39;t even really
care about the money. He more so just
likes people using his super Ebola and
all of his other like engineered viruses
just to kill people for the sake of it.
But he believes that there is an even
more potent bioweapon out there that he
wants to get his greasy paws on.
Pandora&#39;s box. That&#39;s the main item that
must be retrieved by Lara because she
doesn&#39;t want that falling into his
hands. So MI6 gives her a huge
exposition vomit sesh. They diarrhea
out. Tons of info on the bad guy. I I
didn&#39;t write his name down, so I don&#39;t
even remember the bad guy&#39;s name.
What? But he&#39;s he really is that
forgettable. He&#39;s just he&#39;s kind of just
a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] loser. But he wants to use
Pandora&#39;s box to kill the whole world
cuz Pandora&#39;s box in this film is a
plague. That is what is in the box. And
he wants to unleash it to destroy the
planet. That is his entire mission, his
whole goal. And Gerard Butler enters
into the fold. His name is Terry because
Laura needs to team up with Terry
because he&#39;s the best tracker she knows.
He&#39;s like the most equipped for this
mission. But he&#39;s in jail. He gets a
deal from Lara to get him out of jail as
long as he teams up with Lara. And the
two then go try and get Pandora&#39;s box to
stop the bad guy from having it. They
drop out of the battle bus into China
and they find a like this underground uh
group, the same group that she fought
after the CGI sharks when she was
getting the golden snitch. They confront
the group. They&#39;re they&#39;re called the
Shayling. And Laura Croft kills one of
the guys and then they drive motorcycles
on the Great Wall of China. And then
after they escaped the Shayling, after
causing a ruckus, Gerard Butler, Terry,
reveals how he&#39;s still really salty that
their relationship didn&#39;t go anywhere.
These two were once romantic. Almost in
love, you could say, but then things
went cattywampus and he&#39;s not happy. And
Laura, she does not trust Terry. Yep. I
did a really bad job at writing down the
plot synopsis here. It&#39;s all over the
place. But yeah, I I I wrote this down
and it&#39;s true. Terry&#39;s basically the
exact same character as Daniel Craig.
Like personalitywise, he fills the same
role. Literally like a onetoone carbon
copy of Alex. I have to imagine Daniel
Craig just had other obligations so he
couldn&#39;t be part of this film. So
they&#39;re like, &#34;All right, we&#39;ll just
write a new guy and forget about Alex.&#34;
I don&#39;t know. It was It was interesting.
But anyway, the reason their
relationship crumbled is because he left
her and abandoned his country, but he
regrets it.
Anyway though, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m
getting like even deep into this because
it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not fleshed out.
It doesn&#39;t feel natural. There&#39;s no real
chemistry between them. Again, it&#39;s very
stale. Ultimately, the big part of this
film, the action, is still intact and
still fun. Like, the gunfights feel very
much out of a Tomb Raider game from the
PlayStation. The choreography is still
pretty hype. It just looks worse than
the first one. like it like it does take
a step back in its visuals, but I do
appreciate that the action is still
flashy and it is still fun. What
ultimately happens though is they get to
Pandora&#39;s box. They fight some shadow
guardians which are like these tree
demons. So, they fight like these almost
like tree ants. They just kill the
shadow bad guys and they&#39;re forced by
the main bad guy to lead him to
Pandora&#39;s box. And then she fights the
main bad guy who likes boweapons and she
throws him into a pit of acid that
Pandora&#39;s box is sitting in. So he
starts just melting and dying next to
Pandora&#39;s box. And then Terry and Lara
are face to face with the box. Lara
obviously wants to leave the box
believing that this plague is too
powerful for any one man to have. Terry,
on the other hand, wants the box because
he wants to sell it for money. He wants
money. Remind you of anyone from the
first film? So he says, &#34;I need this
because I want to sell it.&#34; And uh well,
that&#39;s not gonna fly. So she refuses to
let him. And so he slaps her and gets
ready to shoot her, but then she beats
him to it, shooting him. Supposed to be
emotional, but all movie these two are
just not clicking. So who cares? Wasn&#39;t
a hard choice is what I wrote down. It&#39;s
very true. It wasn&#39;t a hard choice. And
who cares? Overall, Cradle of Light much
worse than the first film, but still not
a bad time. I actually find these
Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movies to be
pretty charming. Like, I still did enjoy
watching them. They&#39;re decent films.
They&#39;re nothing special, but I think
they&#39;re, I don&#39;t know, a good
representation of early 2000&#39;s action
flicks. Now, we get to the final Tomb
Raider movie, Tomb Raider 2018. I saw
this film in theaters. I even did a
moist meter on it. I didn&#39;t remember a
single [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] scene of this movie until
I recently rewatched it. Literally
remembered nothing from it. It actually
was pretty decent. I think it&#39;s not as
fun as the early Angelina Jolie films,
but it&#39;s really not bad. It is loosely
adapting. I loosely is not even
accurate. It actually in a lot of times
one:1 adapts the Tomb Raider reboot
game. Like it&#39;s not perfect, but it does
make like a very legitimate passionate
attempt to take the content from the
game and translate it to the big screen.
Of course, it takes some of its own
creative liberties, but overall it does
a really decent job. Also to get my boy
Walt Gogggins in here, and I&#39;m a big
Gogggins guy. I&#39;m Google for Gogggins. I
think he is a great actor and he&#39;s
really enjoyable in this film as the
main villain. He is the best villain in
any of the Tomb Raider movies, I would
say, very confidently. He&#39;s like the
only one with an actual motive. He is
tasked, and he gets the short end of the
stick here, with being stranded on an
island until he can procure this ancient
paranormal entity that they can use to
basically take over the world. This new
bad organization. Well, I guess not
exactly new bad organization, but the
organization that is the puppet masters
to him. He is not allowed to leave until
he can find it. But it takes him years
to find it. Many, many years. So, he is
just stuck there unable to leave and he
just so desperately wants to see his
family again. And he will do anything to
get back to his family. So, he has an
actual real motive to be the bad guy.
But, of course, he is very evil. He just
kills people willy-nilly. So, I will say
the beginning of this film is a really
cool premise. Like I it&#39;s again, you&#39;re
gonna recognize it. So, uh, Himiko is an
old ancient ruler who spread death with
a touch but got imprisoned on an island
by her generals. And Lara&#39;s dad has a
map to it and leaves Lara behind to go
unleash her. So, her dad wanted to
pursue him. And this ancient
organization also wants to pursue him
for much more nefarious purposes. You
see, Laura&#39;s dad is doing this because
he wants to find a way to bring his wife
back. He wants proof that there is
something beyond this realm, beyond our
understanding of reality, so that maybe
there is something that could bring his
wife back cuz she&#39;s gone. And he&#39;s very
upset about that naturally. So, it&#39;s
kind of like the polar opposite of
Angelina Jolie&#39;s Lara Croft in this
film. So, the new Lara Croft here is
very much in the beginning steps of her
journey. So, she gets her ass beat
immediately. Like the first scene you
see of this new Lara Croft, she loses a
fight in the ring. And she&#39;s also much
more quirky. Like,
I I really don&#39;t like the quirkification
in this film. I think again, this is
just a symptom of the era that the movie
was made where everything needed to be
quirky and quippy. So, like when she
loses the fight, one of her friends says
that she got marmalized. Not a huge fan
of dialogue like that. Anyway, Lara
Croft is significantly weaker here than
in any of the other movies. Again, she&#39;s
just starting. She&#39;s learning and she
gets her ass beat. She&#39;s also extremely
broke here. So, she&#39;s living paycheck to
paycheck as a carrier. And she&#39;s
extremely broke because she is refusing
her inheritance because by accepting the
inheritance, she would have to admit
that her father is dead. Cuz like I
said, her father uh went to look for
Himiko. Well, she abandoned Lara by
doing he abandoned Lara by doing that
and hasn&#39;t been seen since. So, he is
presumed dead. Thus, she is entitled to
the inheritance, but she doesn&#39;t want to
sign the papers because it would be
admitting that her father is dead. So,
she chooses to live her life broke and
in the shadows. And she eventually takes
this deal to be a fox in a fox hunt
where she rides her bike leaving behind
a paint trail for hunters to follow. And
if they catch her, she loses. But if she
gets away, she wins 600 quid.
She loses and she gets arrested and then
her guardian comes to save her, letting
her know, you have so much money. Why
are you doing this for 600 quid? That&#39;s
when we learn about all of the
exposition with like, you know, I don&#39;t
want the money because then it would
mean admitting papa has perished on that
island. Well, she goes to the mansion
because she&#39;s finally starting to come
to terms with maybe she should just sign
those papers. Her life would be easier.
It&#39; be better. And she&#39;s in the mansion
and she happens to stumble across a
secret room and there&#39;s a a tape in
there that her father recorded and it
actually has the classic trope where it
says, &#34;If you&#39;re watching this, I&#39;m
already dead.&#34; And then he goes into
detail about Himiko asking Lara to burn
the research. Obviously, Lara doesn&#39;t
burn the research. She uses it to go to
the island to find her father. And then
we get to see a familiar journey from
the games play out on the big screen.
And it&#39;s actually pretty decent. Like
the visuals in this film look pretty
good. Like they they look solid. I mean,
it&#39;s 2018. It&#39;s big budget. It&#39;s of
course going to look pretty up to snuff
for the era. But I was actually pretty
surprised with just how good this movie
looked at points. Like I said, I don&#39;t
remember seeing it in theaters. I
evidently did based on the voice meter I
made at the time. But this felt like a
brand new experience and it reminded me
very much of playing the reboot game for
the first time which I did have a good
time with. You see a lot of familiar set
pieces. You see a lot of things play out
similarly to the game but it does have
its own spin on things that I didn&#39;t
love. So it does change certain things
but some of the things that it keeps one
to one I thought really hit. But anyway
she teams up with Captain Lou. They go
to the island. Lou&#39;s dad was also on the
island. They they teamed up together.
Lara&#39;s dad teamed up with Lou&#39;s dad.
They got to the island. Lou&#39;s dad,
unfortunately, was killed on the island.
Lara&#39;s dad was still found alive [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
crawling around on all fours, you know,
like a like an absolute feral creature.
And he doesn&#39;t believe that&#39;s the real
Lara there, but then of course realizes,
no, that&#39;s actually his daughter. I&#39;ve
already mentioned quite a few things
here that weren&#39;t present in the game,
but are in the movie. And like I said,
some of these I don&#39;t think works. Like
for example, the father who hasn&#39;t seen
his daughter for seven years immediately
starts [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on her when he realizes
that she&#39;s there and he and she didn&#39;t
burn his papers. Like he&#39;s not mad about
her presence, per se. But he&#39;s like,
&#34;Well, at least you burned my papers
before coming, right? You burned them
before coming, right?&#34; And she&#39;s like,
&#34;Well, no. How the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] do you think I
got here?&#34; He&#39;s like, &#34;You didn&#39;t burn
my papers.
Damn you, Laura.&#34; And it like
immediately pushes her away when he was
so happy to see her. and how and he like
loved his daughter so much. Immediately
pushes her away. So she leaves. He
doesn&#39;t even care. He lets her go
after not seeing her for seven years. So
like there are definitely some things
here that weren&#39;t present in the game.
At least not that I remember. But there
are some that are like the plane scene,
which I do think the plane scene is
pretty close to how it was in the game
and it&#39;s still pretty hype to see here
just like it was in 2013 in the game.
There&#39;s also like the kill where she has
on the guy like pushing him into like
the puddle where it&#39;s like a really
grueling task to kill this one guy. It
wasn&#39;t just like she popped him
instantly died or like KO&#39;ed him with
like a judo chop or something. It was
like a really intense back and forth
life or death fight that ultimately
ended with her victorious and her taking
someone&#39;s life and she has to come to
terms with that. It like there are some
really good moments here that that are
recognizable from the game, but when it
does try to do its own thing, I do think
it stumbles quite a bit. Anyway though,
I&#39;ll just go ahead and fast forward here
a bit. Uh, Walt Gogggins and Lara, they
meet and they exchange some words back
and forth. Eventually, they, per usual,
the bad guy and Lara team up. So, now
they are teaming up going to Himiko&#39;s
tomb. They are working together because
if they don&#39;t, Walt Gogggins is just
going to kill her dad and she doesn&#39;t
want that. So, they&#39;re going to the
tomb. They&#39;re going to Himiko&#39;s tomb.
There&#39;s like some booby traps along the
way. The booby traps are kind of cool. I
always appreciate some good Indiana
Jones level booby traps. I will say some
of them are really lackluster. So, one
dude steps on a booby trapped tile where
a spike impales him and Richard farts
out a super stinker of a line that I
think makes no sense. He says that
wasn&#39;t designed to keep people out. It
was designed to keep something in.
Brother, how would you be able to deduce
that a spike just shot straight up
through the floor from a single tile? It
wasn&#39;t like an elaborate trap or
anything. It feels like it was almost an
accident that I was there. It feels like
it was a miracle he stepped on that
specific tile, actually. And why the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] would that how would one single
spike be evidence that it was designed
to keep something in? It would do a
horrible job at keeping something in.
Also a horrible job of keeping something
out. It&#39;s just a bad trap. Like that&#39;s
you&#39;re just wrong. You&#39;re just straight
up wrong. Now the next series of traps
is pretty good though with like the
falling floor and stuff. Like I
appreciate the traps. Eventually, they
get to Himiko&#39;s tomb, and they learn
when they open the tomb that Himiko
wasn&#39;t exactly the evil being that she
was portrayed as in legends. She wasn&#39;t
even a paranormal being or anything that
could kill people with a touch. She was
a carrier of a disease. And they uh put
her in this tomb to lock the disease in
there with her, a very potent disease,
which again, you don&#39;t want this evil
organization to get their hands on. So,
they learn this and then Walt Gogggins
takes a finger of her so that way they
can analyze and synthesize the the
disease to weaponize it because it turns
out she wasn&#39;t magic and they need to
make sure that this disease doesn&#39;t get
out. But the disease what it does is it
like melts people&#39;s flesh and turns them
into zombies. It makes zombies like you
know and you get a little zombie fight.
Unfortunately, Richard Croft he catches
a bad deal and he gets injured and Walt
Gogggins is running away. There&#39;s an
emotional reunion between Richard and
Lara. They share some final goodbyes and
it&#39;s very, very profound stuff. And then
Richard blows himself up, destroying
Himiko&#39;s body and the disease there,
sealing it all in the cave. And Lara and
Walt fight fight each other. And uh Lara
That&#39;s uh that&#39;s how it wraps up. But
there is sequel bait where it turns out
the guardian that saved her earlier when
she got like arrested, she is working
with that ancient order as well. She was
actually like the leader of it, it
seems. Don&#39;t know if we&#39;re ever going to
see that sequel. It&#39;s been quite a
while, but that was the film in a
nutshell. Like I said, it wasn&#39;t a bad
movie or anything. I actually did enjoy
it, and it was nice to kind of get a
refresher of the reboot game that I
remembered enjoying. Like, it was cool
to see it. I didn&#39;t hate it. It
definitely had some things I didn&#39;t like
about it. And I do think it&#39;s probably
my least fa Well, no, no, not my least
favorite. I Cradle of Light, I think, is
definitely worse, but I don&#39;t like it as
much as the 2001 movie. I would say it&#39;s
second place out of three here. Not bad.
Didn&#39;t hate it. I actually really did
enjoy watching all three of these movies
again, though. Like, it was kind of fun
to revisit these. They are fun action
adventure films. Uh anyway, the fourth
film I watched is the Assassin&#39;s Creed
movie. That one I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going
to yap about in this video. That one I
might actually make a standalone for cuz
that movie is just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] insultingly
bad. I I hated pretty much every moment
of that one. In a franchise I already
don&#39;t like, a movie somehow was even
worse than I was expecting it to be. I
like it was nuts. Anyway, that&#39;s about
it for now. See you.
