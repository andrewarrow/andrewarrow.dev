YouTube has removed the dislike counter
but the numbers are still available
backstage and I can tell you that my
most disliked videos by far are those on
climate change doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s
good news or bad news some people it
seems reflexively dislike anything about
the topic every time and to be honest I
can kind of understand that it&#39;s a
little tiresome isn&#39;t it climate change
extreme weather heat records blah blah
blah we&#39;ve heard this for so long and
look we&#39;re still here stop talking about
it already I get it and I&#39;d rather just
talk about some fun new physics stuff
but I feel like I need to tell you about
this because the lives of hundreds of
millions of people depend on it climate
scientists are having an argument about
a number one single number called the
climate Sensitivity I don&#39;t like what
I&#39;ve read it really worries me and I
think you should know I know you expect
me to be funny haha not funny peculiar
but I&#39;m afraid this video will be more
on the peculiar side why does Sabina
worry about climate change and why now
that&#39;s what we&#39;ll talk about
today this video comes with a quiz that
lets you check how much you remember
2023 was the hottest year on record
since the beginning of Records in the
mid 19th century not just the average
temperature increased to neverbe seen
levels in many places heat waves were
also longer and hotter than ever before
in February Antarctic sea ice reached an
absolute record low since the beginning
of satellite measurements in
1979 and Global ocean temperatures
reached a new record too I don&#39;t know
about you but to me that sounds pretty
bad now it&#39;s possible that 2023 was
somewhat of an outlier and average
temperatures will somewhat decrease in
the next for years there are several
reasons for this first there&#39;s just
regression to the mean but second
there&#39;s also that in 2023 we switched
from a linia to an ELO phase the linia
ELO phases are Quasi periodic Global
Climate patterns these phases switch
somewhat irregularly but roughly every 2
to three years and the AL n phase that
we just switched to is typically
somewhat warmer so next year might break
more records because it will still be
alinu but in 2 to 3 years we might see a
slight Cooling and third some
researchers have speculated that part of
this year&#39;s warming might have to do
with the decrease in pollution over the
oceans caused by new regulations of ship
exhausts it&#39;s somewhat unclear how large
this effect is but we do know that air
pollution does indeed have a cooling
effect so maybe that&#39;s part of the
reason be that as it may I worry that
even if 2024 is not a new record breaker
the overall trend in the next few years
will be steeply up and the situation is
going to deteriorate rapidly the reason
is to do with a quantity called climate
sensitivity climate sensitivity contrary
to what you might think is not what
makes people hit dislike on climate
change videos it&#39;s a property of climate
models it&#39;s the temperature change that
one finds in a model when one doubles
atmospheric carbon dioxide over the
levels of pre-industrial times and then
waits for the system to come into
equilibrium in the literature it&#39;s
called the equilibrium climate
sensitivity ECS for short this
equilibrium climate sensitivity isn&#39;t
something we directly observe because no
matter how much they dig in Saudi Arabia
in reality carbon dioxide levels don&#39;t
suddenly Jump by a factor two however
it&#39;s a useful quantity to gauge house
strongly a model will react to changes
in carbon dioxide and this climate
sensitivity is the key quantity that
determines the predictions for how fast
temperatures are going to rise if we
continue increasing carbon dioxide
levels up to 2019 or so the climate
sensitivity of the world&#39;s most
sophisticated climate models was roughly
between 2 and 4.5 de C these big climate
models are collected in a set that&#39;s
called the coupled model interc
comparison project seip for short that&#39;s
about 50 to 60 models and is what the
ipcc reports are based on so until a few
years ago we had a climate sensitivity
of 2 to 4.5 de or so and that&#39;s what we
came to work with that&#39;s what all our
plants rely on if you can even call them
plants youve probably all seen this
range in the ipcc projections for the
temperature increase in different
emission scenarios it&#39;s this shade
region around the mean value Loosely
speaking the lowest end is the lowest
climate sensitivity the highest end is
the highest climate sensitivity then
this happened in the 2019 model
assessment 10 out of 55 of the models
had a climate sensitivity higher than 5°
C that was well outside the range that
was previously considered likely if this
number was correct it would basically
mean that the situation on our planet
would go to hell twice as fast as we
expected okay you might say but that was
5 years ago so why haven&#39;t we ever heard
of this what&#39;s happened is that climate
scientists decided there must be
something wrong with those models which
gave the higher climate sensitivity they
thought the new predictions should agree
with the old ones in the literature they
dubed the hot moders problem and climate
scientists argue that these hot models
are unrealistic because such a High
climate sensitivity isn&#39;t compatible
with historical data this historical
data covers many different periods and
reaches back to a few million years ago
back then when we still used D up modems
it&#39;s called the paleoclimate data of
course we don&#39;t have temperature
readings from back then but there&#39;s lots
of indirect climate data in Old samples
from rocks eyes fossils and so on in
2020 a massive study compiled all this
paleo climate data and found that it
fits with a climate sensitivity between
2.6 and 3.9 de C and this means
implicitly that the hot models the ones
with the high climate sensitivity are
not compatible with this historical data
as a consequence the new ipcc reports
now weigh the relevance of climate
models by how well the models fit the
historical data so the models with the
high climate sensitivity contribute less
to the uncertainty which is why it has
barely changed and that sounded
reasonable to me at first because if a
model doesn&#39;t match with past records
there&#39;s something wrong with it makes
sense then I learned the following the
major difference between these hot
models and the rest of the pack is how
they describe the physical processes
that are going on in clouds a particular
headache with clouds is the super cool
phase of water that&#39;s when water is
below the freezing point but remains
liquid the issue is that the
reflectivity of the clouds depends on
whether it&#39;s liquid or not and that
super cooling makes the question just
exactly what influence the clouds have
very complicated but how much data do we
have about how clouds behaved a million
years ago as you certainly know the
dinosaurs forgot to back up their
satellite images so unfortunately all
that mil year old cloud data got lost
and we don&#39;t have any to use the
argument from historical data therefore
climate scientists must assume that a
model that is good for clouds in the
current climate was also good for clouds
back then under possibly very different
circumstances without any direct data to
check that seems to me a very big if
given that getting the clouds right is
exactly the problem with those models
wouldn&#39;t it be much better to to check
how well those models work with clouds
for which we do have observations like
you know the ones that we see in the sky
in principle yes in practice it&#39;s
difficult that&#39;s because most climate
models aren&#39;t any good as weather models
while the physics is the same they&#39;re
designed to run on completely different
time scales you make a weather forecast
two weeks at most but climate models you
want them to run a 100 years into the
future there&#39;s one exception to this
there&#39;s one of the hot climate models
that can also be used as a weather model
with only slight adaptations it&#39;s the
one from the UK Met Office so a small
group from the UK Met Office went and
used this hot model to make a 6-hour
weather forecast they compareed the
forecast from the hot model with a
forecast from an older version of the
same model that didn&#39;t have the changes
in the cloud physics and was some what
colder they found that the newer model
the hotter one gave the better forecast
And just so we&#39;re on the same page when
I say the forecast was better I don&#39;t
mean it was all sunny I mean it agreed
better with what actually happened and
that model with the better predictions
had a climate sensitivity of more than
5° C I know this all sounds rather
academic so let me try to put this into
context the climate sensitivity
determines how fast some regions of our
planet will become uninhabitable if we
continue pumping carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere the regions to be affected
first and most severely are those around
the equator in central Africa India and
South America that&#39;s some of the most
densely populated regions of the world
the lives of the people who live there
depend on that scientist get this number
right so we need this number to get a
realistic idea of how fast we need to
act that the climate sensitivity might
be considerably higher than most current
policies assume is a big problem why
wasn&#39;t this front page news Well quite
possibly because no one read the paper I
didn&#39;t either as of date it&#39;s been cited
a total of 13 times I only know about
this because my friend and colleague Tim
Palmer wrote a comment for nature
magazine which he drew attention to this
result he also asked other researchers
to try and do similar tests with other
models to see how well they perform with
the short-term weather forecast
unfortunately no one listened to him
that includes me because I have better
things to do than read all of Tim&#39;s
comments sorry Tim and in all honesty I
had pretty much forgotten about this but
then late last year a new paper with Jim
Hansen&#39;s lead author appeared which
remind Ed me of this the new Hansen at
all paper is a reanalysis of the
historical climate data in a nutshell
they claim that the historical data is
compatible with the climate sensitivity
of 4.8 plusus 1.2 de celius that agrees
with the hot models and if it was right
it would invalidate the reason that
climate scientists had to dismiss the
models with the higher climate
Sensitivity I don&#39;t want to withhold
from you that some climate scientists
have criticized the new hanset all paper
they have called it a worst case
scenario that is quite subjective and
not justified by observations model
studies or literature though it isn&#39;t
irrelevant to note that the person who
said this is one of the authors of the
previous paper that claimed the climate
sensitivity from historical data is
lower I don&#39;t know who&#39;s right or wrong
but for me the bottom line is that the
possibility of a high climate
sensitivity above 5° C can&#39;t be easily
dismissed especially not seeing how fast
average temperatures have been rising in
recent years and that&#39;s really bad news
because if the climate sensitivity is
indeed that high then we have maybe 20
years or so until our economies collapse
and what&#39;s the point of being successful
on YouTube if my pension savings will
evaporate before I even retire yeah that
that&#39;s a tad bit depressing but if you
want to hear an uplifting story about
Environmental Protection stay around
until the end because I want to tell you
about my friends at Planet wild this
isn&#39;t in the script but it just blows my
mind how mind fuckingly stupid it is
that the lives of all people on this
planet depend on an obscure discussion
about the properties of super cool old
water droplets in a type of cloud whose
name I can&#39;t even remember and that
returns me to the people who reflexively
dislike any video on climate change
because they really really don&#39;t want to
hear about it I believe that most of
them aren&#39;t actually climate change
deniers I think they just can&#39;t see how
it&#39;s going to affect them what&#39;s the big
deal with a few degrees temperature
increase we just turn up the air
conditioning right I think it won&#39;t be
that easy which is why I now want to
spend a few minutes telling you what I
think will happen in the next 20 years
or so the next minutes of this video
will be quite depressing and if you&#39;re
struggling with anxiety I sincerely
think it would be better if you stopped
watching here did I just tell people to
not watch my videos I&#39;m not doing this
YouTube thing right am I if you&#39;re still
with me here we go Earth has five
different climate zones and each has its
own typical type of vegetation if
climatic conditions change rapidly a lot
of plants will not grow properly or die
because it&#39;s too hot or too dry or too
wet or all of the above yes plants like
carbon dioxide but that isn&#39;t going to
make up for the much bigger problem of
the rapidly shifting climate zones and
yes we can try to genetically engineered
plants that are better adapted to the
new circumstances but that&#39;s going to
take time time and time is exactly what
we don&#39;t have if the climate sensitivity
is really as high as the hot models say
people in the developed World somehow
cope with the hotter conditions by
fertilizing and irrigating the hell out
of any agricultural areas they have but
in many countries around the equator
crop yield will substantially drop this
will most affect countries that are
already prone to famine and at the same
time some of the poorest countries in
the world will be hit very hard by heat
waves and drought I don&#39;t think that a
human right for air conditioning that
some people argued for in a Scientific
American article is going to make much
of a
difference okay so we have femine and
drought and heat waves but it&#39;s just you
know where poor people live it isn&#39;t
really our problem right well that&#39;s not
the end of the story because those poor
people who don&#39;t convenient die right
away will draw consequences they&#39;ll
leave we&#39;re talking about some hundred
millions of people who have nothing left
to lose suddenly beginning to migrate
where they go most of them will go north
why just because there&#39;s more land north
of the equator than South that&#39;s going
to cause a lot of tensions at the
southern borders of Europe Russia and
Mexico for just to mention a few someone
somewhere will make a a lot of money by
selling weapons drones will be deployed
some of them will shoot innocent people
will die but wait that&#39;s not it because
death and migration make a great
breeding ground for new viruses bacteria
and fungi so chances are we&#39;re going to
get a new pandemic along with it so we
have widespread crop failure High
numbers of people dead Mass migration
political tensions and possibly War
likely Public Health disasters meanwhile
people in the developed world are
scrambling to adapt moving Inland as sea
water levels continue to rise trying to
install air conditioning wherever they
can and are giving up pretending to cut
back carbon dioxide emissions which is
going to speed up the further
proceedings the result will be an
enormous economic downturn the Practical
consequences for you and I will be that
everyday product will become more and
more expensive until most of us simply
can&#39;t afford them anymore and then
they&#39;ll disappear need a new phone
that&#39;ll be
$50,000 internet connection at home
$8,000 a month wanting new microwave
sorry we&#39;re all out of stock need
someone to fix your roof we&#39;re short on
staff they&#39;re still cleaning up the mess
from the recent flood in simple terms
the problem is that there&#39;s only so much
much work one person can do in one day
and if we&#39;re busy trying to survive
everything else would go on pause people
who are busy building air conditioning
units are people who are not pushing The
Cutting Edge of
nanotechnology I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll go
extinct there&#39;s just too many of us and
I don&#39;t think civilization will entirely
collapse because much of the
infrastructure we already have is going
to last until the worst is over but it&#39;s
good going to be a phase of regress
rather than the progress that we&#39;ve
become used to it&#39;s going to be really
unpleasant will quite possibly reduce
the world population by a few billion
and it&#39;s not a world that I want to live
in and no AI isn&#39;t going to solve the
problem because the problem isn&#39;t that
we&#39;re missing a technological solution
the problem is that we can&#39;t agree to
implement the solutions that we have you
probably expect me to end on some
recommend ations I don&#39;t think it
matters much what I recommend but I also
don&#39;t want you to go away complaining
that I haven&#39;t thought about it so
here&#39;s my wish list put a price on
carbon dioxide emissions now continue to
expand Renewables build nuclear build
nuclear build nuclear stop bitching
about carbon dioxide removal there&#39;s no
way around it and For Heaven&#39;s Sake stop
gluing yourself to things now I&#39;m not
asking you to like this video I don&#39;t
really like it myself but then let me
tell you about something that I do like
that&#39;s my friends at Planet wild who are
saving this planet one step at a time
Planet wild is a community-based
Environmental Protection Organization
they&#39;re funding the restoration of
ecosystems to preserve our nature and
Wildlife I&#39;ve been part of their
Community since earlier this year and
I&#39;ve been really impressed by their work
they select a new partner every month
and they document their missions with
video reports that you can find right
here on YouTube this way you get to
immediately see the impact of your
contribution for example they&#39;ve
repopulated a forest in Germany with the
Eurasian links and in their latest
Mission they&#39;ve gone to Cape ver to
protect sea turtles from poachers with
the help of dogs it&#39;s such a lovely
Hands-On approach and it really makes a
difference all of this is made possible
by a community that funds these projects
a community of nature enthusiasts like
you and I one person doesn&#39;t have a lot
of impact on the environment but
bundling resources of a community can
achieve a lot what I find so great about
Planet W is that they don&#39;t leave me
wondering where my money goes you can
become a nature supporter for as little
as $6 a month that doesn&#39;t even buy you
a sandwich at heo and don&#39;t worry that
you&#39;ll get stuck with them you can
cancel your membership every month I
support Planet wild because I can see it
has a direct impact on preserving nature
and protecting our ecosystems if you
want to join a growing community that
makes a real difference go check out
Planet wild through the link in the
description or by scanning the QR code
and consider becoming a supporter I&#39;ll
cover the first month of your
subscription if you&#39;re among the first
200 people signing up with the code
zabina thanks for watching see you
tomorrow Ro
