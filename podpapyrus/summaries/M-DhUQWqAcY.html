you did theater uh as a you know as a
kid you&#39;re coming along and then you get
this this big break with Scrubs.
Yeah. I had worked at I had a couple
jobs as a as a child actor. Um I had a
pilot for Bruce Paltro for CBS that that
didn&#39;t go anywhere. Um and I didn&#39;t know
that pilots didn&#39;t go pick up. I was get
picked up. I was 14 years old and I was
like what does that mean not get picked
up? I have a gift basket
and there&#39;s a card that says welcome to
the CBS family. I think we&#39;re making
more. And they were like,
it&#39;s so confusing when you&#39;re young.
And you confusing when you&#39;re an adult
as well, but
Yes. It&#39;s also Yeah. So then and then
and then um when I was 18, I got cast in
Manhattan Murder Mystery uh as Woody
Allen and Diane Katon&#39;s son uh in a
scene. So my very first movie role was a
scene at the 21 Club with Woody Allen,
Dian Katon, and Angelica Houston.
Oh my god. So you went right to the deep
end of the pool.
Yes. And then I didn&#39;t know, you know,
when you&#39;re 18 and you get that part,
you&#39;re like, do I I had gotten into
Northwestern film school. It was like,
do I do I go to school? Do I stay and
ride this momentum? Because it was a big
deal. But I decided to go away to to
school and study film making for four
years to to learn how to do that,
right? That&#39;s that&#39;s I think a very wise
move clearly. And it&#39;s clearly worked,
you know.
Thank you. And then I ended up, long
story short, I ended up um in LA waiting
tables and um and then while I was
waiting tables here in in 2000, I got
Um and it&#39;s interesting. I I think
you&#39;ve described one of the darkest
periods of your life was between when
you got scrubs,
but the period between getting it and
production starting
and I&#39;m thinking explain that because
you&#39;d think that would be just a
delightful time or was it did it just
were you filled with fear and anxiety
and imposter syndrome? I think I was
excited, but also my anxiety oddly
spiked a lot. I think it was probably
like, &#34;Oh, no, it&#39;s real now and you&#39;re
going to be judged and it&#39;s not you&#39;re
not hiding out anymore.&#34; Like, but it
but it kicked me in the ass because I um
I had been wrestling with this movie,
the beginnings of this movie that I had
started collecting pieces of the idea in
film school and then when I got out of
film school, I really felt all these
feelings. I moved back home and I but
home didn&#39;t feel like home and I had
this kind of thesis that
is this what became Garden State and I
had it all in pieces and then it became
it was the beginnings of Garden State
and when I had that time between oh I
could quit my waiting job
and we&#39;re not shooting for a while I I
kind of said well come on man this is if
this isn&#39;t if it&#39;s not now when so I
really sat down over those months in
that sort of space and uh and wrote the
the real true first draft of Garden
And this is just as before Scrubs has
Yeah, I was like 20 I was like 24 years
As a T-Mobile member, you can take the
perks with you cuz you&#39;re traveling with

Bl, tell me, I think you get magenta
status. What&#39;s it entail? What&#39;s
included in magenta status?
Yeah, I have T-Mobile. I have had
T-Mobile for a long time. I love it. And
you know, when we went to Thailand, I
got great coverage and great high-speed
data, which means that I could
I hear it&#39;s up to 15 gigabytes. That&#39;s

Terms and conditions apply. What I can
relate to is I remembered hating the
time between when I was announced, hey,
this guy is going to take over for David
Letterman. This is way back in April of
and the start of the show because all I
remember wanting to be judged by my work
and I remember there was just this no I
hadn&#39;t done anything
and um I kept thinking
love me or hate me I just want to start
making stuff and then at least we can
have the conversation.
But right for a while I was just for a
couple of months I was just
You were put under like extraordinary
Because everyone was like who? Oh. Oh,
How dare you?
That&#39;s my That&#39;s That&#39;s my father. Uh
that&#39;s why I take him to the motel. Uh
um I uh Yeah. I mean, it was it was uh
Yes, there was all of that insanity. And
I remember just thinking, can we at
least have And then once I could start
making stuff, people could hate me and
we could be specific about why you hate
You know what I mean?
I never thought it would. I mean, it was
too good to be true for my situation.
and the Scrubs pilot. It felt like it
was written for me. I mean, Bill Bill
Lawrence and I right off the bat had
such the same sense of humor that uh it
just felt so too good to be true. So, I
just thought, you know, I was living so
frugally that this pilot and like a
couple of these episodes, I could live
for years off this,
literally.
And my mom was like, &#34;Why did you quit
your waiting tables job?&#34; I&#39;m like,
&#34;Mom, I&#39;m I&#39;m set for like the way I&#39;ve
been living like with like, you know,
you know, a burrito for lunch and PB&amp;amp;J
for dinner, I am good for years on this
salary from this pilot.&#34; And um and then
it took off and then it really I didn&#39;t
I didn&#39;t have to go wait tables ever
again. I think another thing too that&#39;s
it&#39;s lightning in a bottle, but I think
really good shows um and and this is uh
a credit to to Bill Lawrence and that
team is finding the right people and and
it&#39;s not it it has to be at some point
there has to be like divine inter
intervention but but pairing you and
Donald Faison is this gift that keeps
giving. Yeah. and and your relationship.
You could you could see it on the show
that you guys really clicked and you had
a kind of relationship that I had hadn&#39;t
seen two young men have before on a
show. You&#39;re constantly hugging each
other and telling each other you I love
Uh it was it&#39;s so sweet.
Well, I I think it was really funny. I
think he was also doing a commentary on
on masculinity himself. And I think Bill
was trying to
to show, you know, they became the term
bromance, right? But like to show two
best friends who love each other so
much. They happen to be straight, but in
in in in all other ways they&#39;re in
they&#39;re in love. They love each other
and they just all they want to do is
spend time with each other. And um so
that I think Bill that&#39;s what I think
was so great about what the characters
that Bill created. And of course Donald
and I really were that like we met.
Well, you could tell. You could tell I
could tell that like watching the first
season, I was like, &#34;Oh, they&#39;re also uh
screwing around uh acting like idiots um
off camera and probably annoying where
we met. We met at the we literally met
at the table read and it was love at
first sight and and we became those
characters and then it fed itself
because Bill would be like, &#34;What did
you guys do this weekend?&#34; And we&#39;d tell
him some insane story and then a week
later it would be a version of it in the
script for the for the characters.
