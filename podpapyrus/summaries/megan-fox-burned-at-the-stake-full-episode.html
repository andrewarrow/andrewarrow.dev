what is up daddy gang it is your
Founding Father Alex Cooper with call
daddy Megan Fox welcome to call her
Daddy thank you I am so happy we are
doing this tonight same and I say
tonight which is crazy I have never done
an interview this late in my life it&#39;s
10:00 at night are you a night owl no
but I find that interesting because
you&#39;ve interviewed so many rappers and I
I refuse to believe that they showed up
on time or in the daylight okay offset
didn&#39;t show up on time but it was the
daylight but no I have never done a late
night interview but I do feel like it&#39;s
kind of a Vibe you might end up loving
it yeah okay well I was going to say
guys it&#39;s raining right now there&#39;s
thunderstorms in La we&#39;ve got candles
going this makes sense for a Megan Fox
episode when you are like late night by
yourself your kids are asleep what is
your favorite thing to do at night
usually well I usually stay by the fire
and I like to read and I read a lot of
metaphysical books but right now I&#39;m
reading whatever that new like adult
version of Twilight book that&#39;s out it&#39;s
like a erotic Fairy book wait isn&#39;t it
like the king of or the thorn
Thorns yeah I&#39;m reading that wait does
it like kind of make you horny I haven&#39;t
gotten to the horny part yet but I know
that I&#39;m going to get there because I&#39;ve
I know that he has like the ability to
bind her energetically with magic and
I&#39;m already like I&#39;m here for that
that&#39;ll that&#39;ll do it for you I remember
my friend was reading it she was like
Alex I&#39;m not kidding you I keep waking
my boyfriend up in the middle of the
night because I&#39;m like I&#39;m reading about
fairies but something get me going I&#39;m
like I don&#39;t understand it maybe I need
to read
I&#39;m not there yet but I feel like you
should and it&#39;s definitely a lot more
interesting than most of the like
psychological textbooks that I read by
the fire at night you&#39;re reading
textbooks over there sometimes you enjoy
that can&#39;t say I enjoy it I think that I
do it out
of I made like a really clear decision
when I was young to avoid the pitfalls
or like the traps of social media or
just internet usage in general and so I
kind of go out of my way and maybe it&#39;s
annoying to be this way but to counter
that by attempting to educate Myself by
the way I didn&#39;t graduate high school so
I think a lot of that is just like
pursuing things that I&#39;m interested in
and wanting to have as much information
about it as possible and trying to not
become just like a a plebeian or like a
Mindless brainwashed sheep I think most
of us today are Mindless sheep because I
feel that way sometimes when I&#39;m on
social media too much I&#39;m like what is
happening up here like I I&#39;m not when is
the last time I had an original thought
I&#39;m mindlessly scrolling we got to get
it gives me anxiety like I have group
chats with my friends and they&#39;ll send
me links to things but I don&#39;t keep like
the Instagram app downloaded or anything
like that but even just like if they
send me a link to something on Twitter
and I open the Twitter website just the
energy from the website gives me so much
anxiety that I feel like I immediately
contract like ADH
and I can feel how I&#39;m not able my
thoughts are not able to sustain the
same way and that&#39;s just from being
exposed to it for like 5 Seconds 30
seconds like get me the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] out of here
so I can&#39;t imagine like what it&#39;s doing
to everyone especially like younger kids
that are starting so early with cell
phones it&#39;s actually terrifying it&#39;s
it&#39;s like a drug call her daddy is
brought to you by
T-Mobile when it&#39;s time for a big juicy
gossip session with one of my friends I
need a reliable way to get all the tea
and by tea I mean T-Mobile okay having
more 5G coverage means getting 5G signal
more often and as someone who is
constantly on the go it is so nice to
have a reliable Network that I can count
on being a T-Mobile customer also means
that I have access to a ton of perks
like concert tickets skipping lines at
events and free inflight Wi-Fi so I can
keep posting from the sky that free
inflight Wi-Fi has been key lately
because we are trying to find my best
friend Lauren a man on every flight we
take and I have to keep the daddy gang
updated live with our progress T-Mobile
also has VIP Club magenta lounges that
offer free drinks for T-Mobile customers
and you guys know I can&#39;t say no to a
free dirty martini so Daddy gang kick
your old carrier to the curb it is time
to block their number then go and hit up
T-Mobile when you&#39;re ready to really be
taken care of check out the VIP
treatment at
tmobile.com benefits something I also
noticed about you is you just announced
kind of that you have like a whole new
sleeve tattoo on Instagram yeah what was
the story behind that like how did you
decide to do that well I back when I
died my hair from the Auburn colored red
that it was to this color it was like a
bright red during that
metamorphosis I decided I had bought
weird I became a victim of teu
wait what do you know what that happened
yes only because of Super Bowl someone
introduced me to Teemo and I was like
what what is this though and I was
victimized and I ordered a bunch of um
like stick on tattoos and like fun
things to do with my kids and some of
them were fake sleeves because I was
like oh my kids will love to do this and
I did it on me and I was like wow I love
it and I instantly made an appointment
to get my arm done and I started it but
the artist I was working with had a
different Vision than what I wanted and
so we got halfway up my arm Dust in the
Wind was playing and just that line
repeating over and over again nothing
lasts forever but the Earth and sea and
your tattoos that you get uh kept
playing and I was like okay I have to
stop because this isn&#39;t my vision it
wasn&#39;t a bad tattoo it just wasn&#39;t what
I wanted right so we stopped with half
the tattoo I kept that for like 6 months
and then I found an artist to cover it
most people would say I&#39;m grounded but
I&#39;m also very impulsive like when I
decide to do something it must be done
right then I can&#39;t decide it and then do
it months from now or I&#39;m not I can&#39;t
plan far into the future it has to
happen instantly and so once I found the
cover artist I was like we have to get
it done and we just did it four days in
a row it was like six hours a day they
won&#39;t tattoo you usually past six hours
in one sitting because you&#39;re your skin
starts rejecting the ink so I just did
it four days in a row and sleeved it and
then it healed very weird weird it like
didn&#39;t even peel it was very weird it
just healed it was just fine um
someone that you know also got a lot of
new ink and I have to ask about it or I
would get roasted on the internet MGK
should I call him NGK or Coulson Coulson
or MGK whatever you want he posted and I
saw all the comments of everyone mostly
being like what does Megan think about
his new tattoo what does Megan think
what does Megan think and now I&#39;m
sitting here in person with you and I&#39;m
like I have to ask you like what did you
think when you saw the tattoo well he
has like a really special story behind
why he did that which obviously I&#39;ll
leave for him to tell but he had a
relationship with the tattoos that he
had that he was very conflicted
emotionally whatever they represented
and I don&#39;t actually know he didn&#39;t like
to revisit those memories of the T some
of those tattoos that he had and he
wanted to get rid of them but I think
the piece that she did for him is very
like I think it&#39;s art it gives me like
Rick Owens it gives me like you know
it&#39;s it&#39;s like an elevated version of
all of those tattoos that were pieced
together I think it&#39;s really elegant and
it&#39;s kind of ahead of its time I think
in 10 years that&#39;ll be a trend I don&#39;t
know how many people can take that kind
of pain so I don&#39;t know they&#39;ll people
will be put to sleep and get get the
tattoos done but he did it like fully
awake with no painkillers and no did you
go with him numbing I went to one of the
sessions right there&#39;s probably many
there there were many yeah and it didn&#39;t
feel like something it to me it felt
like he was going through like a
spiritual initiation and that space
needed to be respected and I didn&#39;t need
to be there I stopped by one of them
though but I don&#39;t actually know how he
endured that level of pain because he&#39;s
also tattooing on top of tattoos so
you&#39;re tattooing the scar tissue which
makes it even more painful I I don&#39;t
know I don&#39;t know his liver is also
probably not doing well at this time
prayers for Coulson um I was thinking
about as I was reading those comments
I&#39;m like the internet is such a wild
place what is the craziest rumor you&#39;ve
ever heard about yourself on the
internet there&#39;s lots of those we could
talk about that for a while let&#39;s talk
about it for a while let&#39;s talk about it
um I guess one of the ones that&#39;s very
persistent is that um I&#39;m like satanic
or do Satanic rituals or maybe adjacent
to Illumina or something in that vein
which I think really
started I don&#39;t know why it started
there was just like that one time that I
said I drink blood
ritualistically um and then everybody
was like wow she&#39;s into Satanic rituals
um classic but that was a very
misunderstood thing let me try to
explain it yeah give us like some
context okay here&#39;s the context
everything is a matter of like what
you&#39;re accustomed to or what is
currently like socially acceptable or
normal and back in like the 50s even how
many times did you see like probably
never but like on Leave it to Beaver or
like movies from back then or even the
80s how many times did you see like
little boys would go out with like their
little pop guns and they would cut their
fingers and like Be Blood Brothers right
and they&#39;re like we&#39;re best friends
forever now and they would like smush
the blood together on their fing uhuh
that&#39;s not satanic right that&#39;s normal
and that&#39;s cute that&#39;s sweet that&#39;s like
an innocent like little Bond yeah it&#39;s a
little bond between kids who love each
other they have a pure friendship it&#39;s
that except instead of rubbing your
fingers together the drop of blood
goes in your mouth and I don&#39;t know what
why that becomes satanic I understand
people are like hey that&#39;s weird but
guess what I think is weird
I think it&#39;s weird that girls are out
here letting guys come in their mouth
and they don&#39;t know these guys you&#39;re
letting somebody put their sperm in your
mouth and you don&#39;t know what he he
doesn&#39;t even have a job you met him on
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tender he&#39;s an entrepreneur or
whatever he&#39;s in a startup and you just
him sperm in your mouth that&#39;s
disgusting that makes my back hurt that
makes me sweaty so [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you you&#39;re so
offended that I got a drop of Machine
Gun Kelly&#39;s blood in my mouth
you have Brandon from Silicon Valley&#39;s
sperm in your mouth he didn&#39;t even buy
you a nice
drink I&#39;m
crying Honestly though it&#39;s a matter of
perspective what is so gross about what
I did with my soulmate you guys are out
here letting strangers come on you this
disgusting it is these are the facts we
really needed to discuss today Megan we
could end the interview here you know
what I mean because this is the
hard-hitting truth and I appreciate the
honesty because when you give us little
context it does kind of make [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
sense and you&#39;re right like anyone can
look at it any way like just like
Christianity when they&#39;re like drinking
wine and they believe it&#39;s the blood of
Christ like everyone has their thing
like let everyone [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] live what do
you give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are you drinking
someone&#39;s blood no so why do you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
care if I do like it doesn&#39;t matter but
this is a great point about the come and
we should Circle back on that for the
women at the end of this episode and
really talk about who should be coming
inside of you and your mouth and yeah I
appreciate this what other rumors do you
have any that come to mind oh that&#39;s
just the main one that&#39;s that&#39;s the
first one and just to clarify because I
didn&#39;t go on record of saying that&#39;s not
true I actually was raised like
Pentecostal Christian I don&#39;t I&#39;m not
currently like a part of the church but
I definitely identify with Christ
Consciousness and I&#39;m actually a very
spiritual positive person um except for
recently except for been going through
it a little bit in terms of positivity
but um definitely have never been a part
of a Satanic ritual don&#39;t know any
people who have been a part of the
Satanic ritual I&#39;m not sure if the
Illuminati is real it probably is I have
not been extended an offer to join I
feel like if it was real I would have
been given an offer to join by now um so
yes just to squash that not a Satanist
or any kind of like an evil witch light
yes I do you know rituals but that
doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not a negative thing
anything is a ritual taking doing your
skincare routine is a ritual going to
church is a ritual so I think people
have to separate that word that word has
been demonized for so long yeah that
it&#39;s just been very misunderstood and
also I think we exacerbated it because
Halloween of that year um I dressed up
in bondage with a dog collar around my
neck and he dressed up at was a priest
and he was feeding me communion on my
knees and we we we played Marilyn
um sweet sweet dreams we played that
that was the song to The and people felt
like that was a confirmation of the
Satanic rituals so you can kind of see
like where people may like they may I
can see I can see where I planted a seed
and and there grew a tree in its place
but you&#39;re here to chop down the tree
and be like it never [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] happened
yeah he he didn&#39;t want me to C clarify
he was like it&#39;s actually so much just
let them think this that it&#39;s so much
cooler that people think we&#39;re this
bizarre that we&#39;re this weird that we&#39;re
doing this kind of weird ma magical
weird [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in our basement like let them
think that this is what&#39;s going on but
it is kind of a testament to like
everything they see on social media is
space value and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not that
deep it was Halloween let&#39;s go back to
the beginning Megan Fox what were you
like as a
kid I told my mom when I was two that I
was going to be a famous actress
so I knew and that wasn&#39;t out of passion
for acting I&#39;ll be honest I just always
knew that that&#39;s what it was going to be
I had like an awareness of my destiny
for some reason at a young age and I was
a tomboy when I was a little kid I was
outside um I had like a very assertive
energy as a child and whenever my mom
would get like secret psychic readings
because she was Pentecostal so that was
a no no to see psychics they would
always read that she had an older
daughter and a younger son and that the
younger son was me um and I&#39;m not really
sure why I always came through that way
except that I have no one&#39;s going to
know what I&#39;m talking about right now
but I have Mars on my ascendant in
astrology so I have like a warrior
energy that I was born with and I think
that was translated as being like maybe
masculine as a child because it wasn&#39;t
docile but I was like a good kid I was
like a little mischievous
and never interested in school always
knew that that was not for me what was
the dynamic like in your house um my
parents got divorced when I was
and prior to that I just remember both
my parents are still alive and so I want
to be careful not to drag them but while
also being honest I remember my mother&#39;s
Depression was really really affected me
very deeply and it was very visceral for
me and like if I were to draw an image
of my mother from my childhood it would
be her like this is not a literal image
but she just always seemed like like a
soaking wet blanket or like like draped
over a couch like weeping that was that
would be like my image of mother because
I was so connected to her sadness or her
her feelings of being unfulfilled and
also her resentment towards
relationships my dad before I skipe my
dad is like really outgo and funny and
charming and like really unique and
sparkly and they she was I don&#39;t know
she was not fulfilled in that
relationship for whatever reason they
got divorced from my perspective as a
three-year-old he kind of disappeared
for a little while she immediately got
remarried my stepdad who was passed was
um probably had borderline personality
but back then he was diagnosed I think
bipolar and so he was emotionally and
mentally and verbally very abusive to me
not to her um and he isolated me from
her and just in general like I wasn&#39;t
allowed to have friends over or like go
to anyone&#39;s house so I spent a lot of
time isolated in my room um and wasn&#39;t
able to really even spend much he wanted
her I I guess he isolated her is really
what was happening but it seemed as
though I was the one being isolated yeah
then I watched her depression through
that relationship as well and so the
messaging that I received is that men
and marriage in particular drain you of
your life force and keep you from being
able to express your creativity or
express your unique desires and it&#39;s an
oppressive experience to be in a
relationship or to be in love or to be
married in particular being married like
when I say the word being married I feel
my I feel my chakra is tighten up I feel
my like yeah get tight even though I was
married for a long time so that does
that does that answer your question
about my Dy it is interesting and you
have one sibling are you older or
younger no I have an older sister but
she&#39;s 12 years older so she was going to
college when I was still really young
and she was gone a lot cuz prior to that
when I was really young she was in high
school and she wasn&#39;t around much and
she had a boyfriend and she got married
and she moved out so I was alone a lot
and trying trying to make sense of my
mom&#39;s depression and the disconnect and
then the like the emotional violence
coming from my stepfather and also
wanting to be with my dad more and not
being able to to be around him because
he always was a light and he still is a
light and but he was separated from me
in a way where I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t get
to the light it&#39;s kind of like you can&#39;t
get to God y that that constant like
wanting to connect with the father
figure like either spiritually or
literally yeah yeah I feel like a lot of
people that I&#39;ve talked to I have such
empathy for people
that whether literally or just like by
age kind of had a upbringing that you&#39;re
essentially an only child like your
sister being so much older than you like
you were in the house alone and I feel
like a lot of times when there&#39;s such
chaos from the parents like there is I
found you can have such an emotional
connection to siblings because you can
look at someone to your right and your
left and be like oh we&#39;re going through
the same [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] whereas when you&#39;re an
only child essentially in those moments
you can only internalize think what&#39;s
wrong with me or hate what&#39;s going on
around you and try to do the complete
opposite of what your parents did I feel
like obviously we&#39;ve seen in movies you
play just like the most popular hot girl
and when you got to high school cuz I
know you said when you were younger you
were very tomboyish you would be loone
what was your high school Dynamic like
like were you the cool girl or were you
the opposite of that no in middle school
I had I was always a loner I guess and
not necessarily by choice
but have you ever taken the inag test do
you know what that is I do know what
that is do you know what number you are
I completely forget what number I am and
now you&#39;re probably a one if I had to
guess oh my God what does that mean is
that a good or or a seven actually
you&#39;re probably a seven the Enthusiast
the take take it and then tell me take
it and then like I don&#39;t know how this
works but like insert it into this
interview and tell me if I was right and
my face pops up like I am a one no no a
seven a seven I think you&#39;re the
Enthusiast I&#39;m a four which is um I
think in in that one they call it the
Romantic but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a personality
that&#39;s been developed where I identify
as being an outcast or being so
incredibly unique and unusual that no
one could ever understand me and so for
me like the the worst insult you could
give me is that I blend in with everyone
else or I have like a vanilla
personality or that I&#39;m normal but that
actually stems from a family environment
where I didn&#39;t feel that I belonged and
never felt a part of anything and then
as I went out into the world in school
that was also reflected back to me where
I didn&#39;t fit into a friend group and I
wasn&#39;t received well by kids and then as
I left school and went out into the
world as a famous person the world
received me that way as well with a lot
of contention and um a lot of negativity
and a lot of projection and so it&#39;s a
part of my identity but it&#39;s a survival
NE mechanism to say I&#39;m a pariah like
I&#39;m I&#39;m an outlier that&#39;s that&#39;s who I
am and and I&#39;m proud of that and that&#39;s
who I need to be now that&#39;s how I
self-identify but really that comes from
a deep wound of looking to have belonged
somewhere at some point in my life and
never finding a place that I fit
that&#39;s really actually interesting to
hear cuz I was going to say like on one
hand it is a survival mechanism for you
to get through but I&#39;m also like isn&#39;t
yeah yeah it&#39;s super lonely but I was a
lonely baby I&#39;ve been love and lonely my
whole life so and when I meet with like
I&#39;ve met every healer every psychic
every they&#39;re always like well this is
you&#39;re a nine life path this is your
life last life you&#39;re an old soul old
souls are lonely old souls are sad
you&#39;ve been doing this a long time
you&#39;ve been through a lot of trauma
you&#39;ve had every kind of experience you
can have and there&#39;s like this sort of
Bittersweet experience
of it&#39;s uh it&#39;s lonely but I also know
that part of my purpose is to be in
service to others my children in
particular but yeah it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not
a particularly
like I feel alone yeah a lot but to
answer your question about high school
and middle school I wasn&#39;t cool I had an
eating disorder in Middle School a
really bad one I had to be hospitalized
twice and I was left in there like I my
mom will say she took me out for
Christmas I don&#39;t think that&#39;s accurate
I think I was in there for Christmas but
I was in there for a few months at a
time every time they would put me in
essentially I was 5150ed because my
eating disorder was so bad um I had
braces I had plucked out all of my
eyebrows um and when you do that when
you pluck your eyebrows by the way for
anyone that&#39;s ever going to do this if
you do that when you&#39;re sick or your
immune system is down those hairs don&#39;t
grow back so plucked my eyebrows but out
most of them never agw back why did you
pluck them
out it it was like a like cutting or
like any kind of a I was just doing
things to myself to
like not disfigure myself but it was a
compulsive action that I didn&#39;t
understand at the time and then in high
school like if you saw my high school
yearbook picture I&#39;m at that by that
point was cute again I had figured it
out somehow but eal as lonely and like
isolated and I had a friend but I&#39;ve
never had like a friend group how did
boys treat you in high school I had a
high school
boyfriend I didn&#39;t I don&#39;t know at that
point I had started like some modeling
in Miami and doing like auditioning for
acting things I think during High School
I did that Mary Kate and Ashley olon
movie I&#39;m not exactly I think I was like
17 um the kids in school I didn&#39;t get
like a real reaction from the boys in
school but as I went out into the world
doing that stuff I started getting
reactions but also from like much older
men which was weird because they were
not my peer group obviously and that
sent a whole another like set of
confusing messages uh yeah I&#39;m curious
before we do get into that like when
people probably think of Megan Fox in
high school they&#39;re like H I would have
killed to look like you like did you
have insecurities yeah I&#39;ve had body
dysmorphia since I was probably like
five I can remember sitting in the back
of my sister&#39;s car she was getting
married and I even remember what I was
wearing I had black shorts that had
white pokka dos on them and I was five
and this is crazy when I look at my
children because now I understand what
it is to be five years old and I was in
the backseat looking at my legs being
like I have such fat thighs my thighs
are so fat and I was five but I also had
like a I think I was blonde in a past
life or and or I mean I&#39;ve had many past
lives whenever I would look in the
mirror as a child I was like that&#39;s not
me that never felt like me I nothing
about that face the hair the skin color
the body that wasn&#39;t me I never
Associated that with me and so I think
that&#39;s because I have a strong tie to
some of my other lifetimes and it was
always hard for me to accept that this
is who I am in this lifetime and that
goes back to when my parents were still
married so I was like two or three my
mom said that I used to go into the
bathroom and stand on the toilet and
pull up my shirt to see if my boobies
had grown and I would get really upset
that I didn&#39;t have big boobs and now I
$30,000 later now I
do solve that problem honestly girl get
it I was going to yeah cuz I was going
to ask you like I know you been open
about body dysmorphia and I know that
just doesn&#39;t just go away and like where
do you think that control of because
that&#39;s essentially a control thing of
like you&#39;re trying to control how you
look like what were you what do you
think now you look back you were trying
to achieve I think ultimately at the
time that I was going through it it was
loss of control because of the the
dynamic between myself and my stepfather
and having no like no autonomy
whatsoever and like not being able to
have friends or to leave the house or to
even like do things freely inside the
house but prior to that it was just a
feeling of being defective or being
unwanted and for whatever reason I&#39;m not
sure why it manifested specifically as
that and not as like addiction issues
which I&#39;ve never had but it it it
manifested as body dysmorphia and
self-esteem instead your ex-husband made
headlines recently when he said that you
never got to experience
being a single young woman because you
guys met when you were only 18 and he
was 31 at the time M do you agree with
him like do you feel like you missed out
on anything because of that relationship
I feel
like first of all let me just say I was
not a great girlfriend to Brian I&#39;ll
will be very honest and like he was not
great to me either all the time but I
think it would be easy for me to lean
into and complain about or let it seem
like that relationship was one way that
maybe I was not great because I was
young and really should not have been in
a relationship of that that level of
commitment and that magnitude with I I
shouldn&#39;t have been involved in that
when I was 18 19 20 21 22 23 I shouldn&#39;t
have been so I did a lot of like falling
in love with other people all the time
um I would go to work and fall in love
because I was a kid
um yeah I never had the full freedom to
like be single and experience that life
and I thought for a minute when I got
divorced that that&#39;s what I was going to
do and I was single for like three
and then then you just met that guy yeah
I thought I was really going to go full
like Leo DiCaprio for a while that would
have been really like fun to watch
everyone says that to me um everyone
agrees I now need to know because you
referenced in the beginning of this
interview like it literally makes your
skin crawl when you think about marriage
but you did get married like how did you
decide to do that I think because then I
was so unaware of my feelings because I
was so so much younger and this was
before I had my kids and most of my
growth and
like awareness came after childbirth so
prior to that I was
very I just wasn&#39;t aware that oh
marriage makes me feel any particular
way that was something I did kind of
impulsively um also it was like an
adventure to to go on and to do and I&#39;d
already been with him for so many years
at that point and I do feel like
karmically I was supposed to have those
kids with him of course so I didn&#39;t
realiz you know I wasn&#39;t looking at
myself being like Oh I&#39;m
reenacting my mother&#39;s life I&#39;m or I&#39;m
carrying my mother&#39;s burdens or I&#39;m
carrying you know the things that she
projected on to me I was not able to
recognize any of that I was just in the
moment and had not had therapy or
anything like that and I not started
reading and educating myself so I was
just acting and doing and I got myself
into a relationship which I of course
found no shade to Brian unfulfilling
because inevitably that&#39;s what I was
going to do because I was reenacting
what I watched my mother as a child yeah
yeah I think that&#39;s something that&#39;s
like fascinating when you get into
therapy you&#39;re like oh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like I&#39;m
just I literally said I didn&#39;t want to
be like my mother and I&#39;m turning into
my mother and it&#39;s on us obviously to
like take some accountability of Our
Lives to be like pause how do I try to
change this but it&#39;s really [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hard
to not do what we saw growing up when I
think about you and and since the rise
of your career I feel like your name in
the public eye has been synonymous with
the phrase sex symbol right how does
that make you
feel I&#39;ve never been like particularly
attached to that to be honest I&#39;m not
like I don&#39;t have an
emotional reaction to that I don&#39;t
believe but let me sit here and analyze
it while you&#39;re asking me I think it
adds pressure to a girl who like I said
has body dysmorphia and didn&#39;t really
ever see herself that way and the the
things that I thought were my strengths
like my mind my intelligence or um my
sense of humor which is granted like
very Niche sometimes but um those things
are not acknowledged and instead I&#39;m
being acknowledged for something that I
don&#39;t identify with or as and so that&#39;s
almost like this artifice it&#39;s like
forcing me
to wear a character that I don&#39;t
actually I wasn&#39;t trying to wear and
then also you assign the character to me
and then you torture and demonized the
character and I was never that I was
never her like you you created her and
then you murdered her
and that I love that I started this out
by being like I don&#39;t have an emotional
attachment to this like you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
killed me [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] but um I think to just
being called a symbol I don&#39;t initially
have a reaction but to the whole process
of what really happened and it goes it&#39;s
into just being famous in general in the
process of Fame has been
really haunting to be honest because
like I said the media and people built
up this character and then decided to
destroy her because I I I don&#39;t know why
there&#39;s a need to like worship and then
and Destroy worship and then destroy and
I was always a sensitive kid but I had
to wear armor to survive my childhood
and I had to wear armor to survive being
famous and so there&#39;s this energy of me
of that you know that I don&#39;t give any
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and to some degree that&#39;s true in
terms of I would never change anything
about myself in order to get someone to
like me so in that way I don&#39;t give any
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t get
my feelings hurt and that when I&#39;m being
bullied or dragged that that doesn&#39;t
cause me to be mentally unwell sometimes
because it absolutely does and did and
2009 Crossing into 2010 I had been
famous not even that long only a couple
of years but the fame was so heightened
it was so intense that all the energy
started peing and I was going through
this process of I was getting crucified
in the Press every day and on whatever
the blogs were at that time there was no
social media but like Perez Hilton and
like was it Nikki Swift there was some
other there was so mean Daily Mail what
you remember what they would like say
about you the same the same exact things
they say right now you could swap the
Articles from this year with 2009 and
2010 it&#39;s the exact same thing obviously
being a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] being a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] now I have
kids for people to project on and be
like but all right you&#39;re a shitty mom I
didn&#39;t have that at the time but it was
just like you&#39;re a shitty person for
whatever reason um plastic surgery fake
talentless
uh there&#39;s so many there&#39;s so many
headlines I used to get chased by
Paparazzi who would be like um Megan
everybody&#39;s saying that you&#39;re overrated
do you think that you&#39;re overrated Megan
everybody&#39;s saying that you shouldn&#39;t
have got your nose done nobody likes
your new nose are you embarrassed that
you got your nose done are you sad do
you regret getting your nose done Megan
um why are you such a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] why does
nobody like you like grown men right
chasing you with back then this was like
TMZ cameras they don&#39;t talk to you like
that anymore but back then they did so
you&#39;re in life getting bullied by actual
grown adult men with cameras everywhere
you go then there&#39;s like the online
presence of just getting torn to shreds
for everything that you do everything
that you wear how you look every single
flaw every pimple every scar every five
pounds you gain five pounds you lose
you&#39;re you can&#39;t win and that energy was
peing and it was every day and during
2009 they had a blackout a Megan Fox
blackout where the media all agreed to
not post any content about me for a
whole day which by the way I was like I
hope you do this every day thank you but
the attitude was that oh this is that I
was a Fame [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] or an attention [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
which is the opposite of the truth I&#39;m
extremely introverted and horrified by
having to be in front of people or
cameras um but it got so bad at that
point I was just like hey I can&#39;t
survive the criticism and the bullying
anymore like I actually can&#39;t live every
time I step out of my house someone has
something to say about how I look or
it&#39;s going to be it started to become a
witch hunt where I felt like tabloids
would send photographers with the
intention of getting a bad photograph or
getting a bad getting a bad story this
was around the time it may have been a
little before but it was in the years of
when Britney shaved her head and so the
media at that time they were on witch
hunts and they would set out to try and
find something negative um the ugliest
picture they could get to Splash it
everywhere because that&#39;s what people
want to that gets the most engagement
obviously even back then before of
course socials existed and that&#39;s when I
sort of stepped away for a long time and
I was like I&#39;m good to
just not be involved in this anymore
because I actually can&#39;t sustain this
amount of damage it&#39;s not normal and I
also feel like it was kind of just me at
that time whereas now all of us get it
there&#39;s so many other girls that getting
it constantly but back then it really
was kind of just me there wasn&#39;t another
actress that was getting it the same way
I was getting it like as I&#39;m listening
to you it&#39;s first of all it&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
exhausting like I cannot imagine and
what you&#39;re sharing with me in the
beginning of this being like at such a
young age I looked in the mirror and I
was like I literally cannot connect with
my physical appearance and it&#39;s so hard
for me to look at myself and be like is
that me in the mirror I don&#39;t feel that
way to know the eating disorders and the
body just more feel like what you were
going through how exacerbated it then
became because you became famous if you
had to say and I know there&#39;s like no
answer but like why do you think people
are so obsessively trying to pick at you
and pull you down I don&#39;t know I think
like if I were
to try and speak about it from a
spiritual angle
that&#39;s I&#39;m the architect of this
experience and so I&#39;m drawing this to me
because my soul needs to learn and deal
with these feelings and be able to
transcend This I Believe in a past life
I actually was burnt at the stake for
being a witch so I think that&#39;s an
energy that I&#39;ve had like through
lifetimes and it&#39;s carried into this
lifetime as well because that is
essentially what is happening today
every day people don&#39;t realize it but
they all wake up and they&#39;re just a
reincarnated medieval mob and they have
their Pitchfork and their Lantern and
they&#39;re like who do we get to burn the
steak today who do we get to cancel
today who do we get to destroy today and
that&#39;s the first thing they do they go
on Twitter and they&#39;re like what&#39;s
trending this I want to join in on this
and that&#39;s also something that should be
studied is like why do people want to
join in
on something so which is essentially
psychological violence why do you want
to join in on that because I think most
people if you were walking walking on
the street and you saw me or you saw Kim
or Kylie or any of these other girls and
we were being beaten by a mob of people
your instinct is not going to be to join
the mob and to beat us it would probably
be to either help or to go get help
however when you watch that same thing
happen online and it&#39;s the psychological
violence the instinct is to join and
that&#39;s a very
weird that&#39;s a very weird Instinct that
people have that should ask themselves
like why do I want to be a part of
tormenting torturing mocking making fun
of or bullying when we do understand the
ramifications and the danger of doing
this it&#39;s such a good way to look at it
and it&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] terrifying and I
think I think that as I&#39;m sitting here
listening to you like I also just have
to like acknowledge like you are
conventionally like a beautiful woman
like you have been called in certain
years like the most beautiful woman in
the world and I think people
cannot accept that you could have it all
you can&#39;t be this beautiful and be smart
you can&#39;t be that beautiful and be a
good person and I think it brings so
many insecurities out in people when
they look at you I think for women like
I remember I just saw a Tik Tok of this
woman who was like I just lost 100 lb
and my life is so different because I
used to walk in rooms and women would
befriend me and Men treated me like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
and now it&#39;s the opposite I walk in a
room and every [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] woman looks at me
like a threat and every man is opening
the door for me treating me like a queen
and I&#39;m like whoa I just live two
different [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] experiences in a year
and I&#39;m like which one would I choose
but I think you threaten women because
you&#39;re confident and beautiful and
educated and smart and we&#39;re all like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you you can&#39;t be like that but to
men I mean I was going to read this to
you I was like what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is wrong
with the world I read an old article
okay and they they described you as a
screen saver on a teenage boy&#39;s laptop a
middle-aged lawyer shower fantasy and a
sexual prop used to sell
movies like The objectification of you
Megan Fox is so much larger than you it
is like the embodiment of misogyny and
what&#39;s wrong with our [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] society
and it&#39;s terrifying even hearing though
it come from your own voice of like I
didn&#39;t ask for this I didn&#39;t I&#39;m not out
there selling my body and my soul to
this like I&#39;m just trying to do my job
and somehow people are like take her the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] down like yeah I also it was always
confusing to me because I never really
did anything bad I was never like
associated with drugs or alcohol I was
never around until recently anyone who&#39;s
been associated with drugs or alcohol I
was never caught at clubs I was never
arrested I was never I I never did
anything outside of having like a kind
of Andy Kaufman esque sense of humor
which people don&#39;t understand that is my
greatest crime and so it was very hard
to understand in the beginning and I&#39;ll
be honest with you it&#39;s hard to keep
enduring it because I did step away for
a decade and I did all this work on
myself spiritually and thought that I
was transcending and growing and
becoming a better person and so when I
got divorced and I started dating
Coulson inevitably I was sort of thrust
back into the light the synthetic light
not the real light
and I thought that either it would be
different I would be attracting a
different experience to myself this time
because my level of cons was so much
higher or my ability to deal with it
would be so much better at this point
because I was a different person and I
have not found that to be the case at
all like I&#39;ve been doing it it&#39;s going
on the fourth year now um and it is
wearing me down I&#39;ll be honest like it&#39;s
very hard I think because I don&#39;t have a
family support system or like a large
group of I don&#39;t feel that I belong
because I am I do feel so alone like you
said said when you have to deal with
something and you don&#39;t have siblings or
you feel like you&#39;re by yourself you
internalize and then it can become very
gri very quickly and I do I am kind of
getting to the end of my rope with that
I&#39;ll be honest like I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m
struggling with it again it feels like I
was in a wormhole like I left 2009 and
I&#39;m like right back in where I left off
and there was no growth which makes me
defeated and I just I really I can&#39;t
how negative human beings are and
how cruel they need to be to everyone
this is not just me but that also weighs
on me because I have kids and I have one
kid who&#39;s like an artistic Savant and
that kid will inevitably be in the
spotlight somehow it&#39;s impossible that
they won&#39;t and I know how cruel the
world is because I&#39;ve lived through it
and I don&#39;t think I can endure watching
what my child is going to have to go
through um so I&#39;m really struggling with
that as well of like not wanting my kids
to have to be exposed I was going to say
it&#39;s also just like this vicious cycle
like you said like everyone builds
someone up we&#39;ve seen it with so many
stars online and then the minute you&#39;re
at the top they break you down and I
already know it&#39;s like if you disappear
again and you go away oh my God we
missed Megan it happened to me twice
when I went away there was like this
surge of of like I hate this phrase but
it applies I would not normally say this
there was that Peak and energy where I
was getting crucified every day I went
away I disappeared I was like fine [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
it you in the world had like their postn
not Clarity and they were
like wait but why do we why did we kill
her why did we murder her she never did
anything what did she do she was
actually like she was actually a she she
stood for a lot of really good things
like we should have given her her
flowers why did we do that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and then
I step back I&#39;m like was someone
knocking were you guys were you guys
calling me I&#39;m I&#39;m here I&#39;m here to
receive my flowers and it was immediate
just murder immediately and so what the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that experiencing that cycle like
you said if I were to disappear again
right now like I did in 2009 which
believe me I&#39;m very tempted to do
because I am not well at this moment the
same thing would happen where people
would be like oh but she brought you
know she had this messaging she was such
a smart girl she was a grounded girl she
was encouraging she was supportive of
other women she was this she was that
she was I promise you 40 Years After I&#39;m
dead it&#39;s going to be like with not to
compare myself to Marilyn but the way
she died and then everyone&#39;s like well
you know she was a genius you know she
had 142 IQ that&#39;s going to happen to me
too I&#39;ll years from now I&#39;ll be dead and
then somebody will have something nice
to say about me but living it&#39;s not
going to happen it&#39;s even like making me
think as you&#39;re just talking and I&#39;m
staring at you like you are so bright
and you have so much to offer and it
makes me sad because I know so many
people will listen to this and be like
wait she&#39;s actually like really [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
dope but it shouldn&#39;t take you sitting
for an hour and talking if you&#39;re a kind
person you&#39;ve never done anything to
anyone so you shouldn&#39;t have to prove
yourself but it&#39;s like frustrating that
this there&#39;s this pull and push on the
internet and you just can&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] win
and I&#39;m sorry you have to deal with that
um I&#39;m curious like how did how did and
how has this like extreme focus on your
look and body impacted your relationship
sex that&#39;s a good question I have Virgo
in my eighth house so Meg you got to
like talk to the girlies that are like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I have no idea what you&#39;re talking
about I know I&#39;m trying I think Google
it yeah you got to you got to deeply
Google to understand what I&#39;m talking
about there but
I it does affect obviously anything
that&#39;s going on with your self-esteem
affects your relationship to
sex but I will say I feel like as I took
more control of my body actually because
when I was younger it was like really
scandalous to get anything done so my
boobs have been fake by the way since I
21 or two I got them done in between the
first and second Transformers but I had
them done conservatively I&#39;ve done this
way too many times during this interview
I hate it you got to like you got to AI
those out and I can&#39;t I can&#39;t keep doing
that I&#39;ll just bump it on your face when
you do it okay um where was I okay so I
had them I had I had they were very
conservative cuz back then you had you
everyone did the work you had to do work
that was undetectable obviously people
have been doing work since Hollywood
began that&#39;s the way the studios would
bring you in and do a screen test and be
like okay John Wayne he needs a chin
implant Marilyn she needs a nose she
needs this she needs that that&#39;s the
oldest Story Ever Told but back at that
time when I was doing it it had to be
unno unnoticeable but I always that
little girl that was in the mirror like
where are my boobies I always wanted big
boobies and so I I wasn&#39;t happy with the
first set the same thing with like
we might can we just talk about plastic
surgery since we&#39;re on this let okay so
I&#39;m just going to go through all the
things that I&#39;ve done love call her
daddy is brought to you by Tinder dating

this is it explore all the possibilities
for yourself Tinder it starts with the
swipe download Tinder today can we just
talk about plastic surgery since we&#39;re
on this let talk okay so I&#39;m just going
to go through all the things that I&#39;ve
done love because I feel like there&#39;s
this stigma and I&#39;m not going to win I&#39;m
going to do this I&#39;m not going to win
however I&#39;m hoping it sets some people
free let&#39;s go
because I feel like
people are like well we like we we if
you were to ask women they would be like
well we we say these things we bully you
some of my favorite comments are from
women and I don&#39;t often read them but
sometimes I&#39;m in the mood and I&#39;m like I
want to interact with a troll and it
takes one second for them to start
pouring into my Instagram feed or my my
comments and they&#39;re often from women
where I&#39;ll be like holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that is a
particularly cruel thing to say who is
this person and I&#39;ll click on it and
she&#39;ll will be like women&#39;s life
coach Crystal
healing loving God tantric
lessons divine feminine and she&#39;s under
my comments being like you know call
crucifying me for being plastic or
whatever so there&#39;s but that if you were
to ask her she would be like well that&#39;s
because she perpetuates an unhealthy
standard of beauty right but and so here
I am I&#39;m going to be fully transparent I
still won&#39;t win because there are some
girls who have been who have been
transparent I don&#39;t want to like bring
people in but someone like a Kylie has
been very transparent that is not
helping her people are women are still
brutally dragging her just the same and
totally undeserved she&#39;s a beautiful
healthy young gorgeous girl and I
actually feel for whatever reason very
protective when I watch other girls go
through this I want to defend them or go
to war for them but okay I&#39;ll go through
here&#39;s things I have haven&#39;t done that I
have been accused of doing and then I&#39;ll
confirm the things I have done okay I&#39;ve
never had a facelift of any kind so no
midface lift no like lateral brow lift
although I would like one or no regular
brow lift um I&#39;ve never done threads I
have researched them that&#39;s not because
of some moral thing I just don&#39;t really
believe they work and I&#39;m also afraid
that they would interfere when I do need
to have a face lift but I am very
tempted to go have my eyebrows snatched
like all all the way I want I want that
look sometimes that seems fun and you
can do it on a lunch break and I see why
it&#39;s so tempting and I I have researched
it have not done it yet okay um I&#39;ve
never had this done what is this oh b b
fat Buckle fat Buckle fat Buckle fat
I&#39;ve never had that done I&#39;ll never have
any fat removed I&#39;m a very like lean
person that doesn&#39;t have enough body fat
or fat in my face so I will only ever
put fat in I will never be taking fat
out which leads me to I&#39;ve never had any
like lipo suction or body contouring or
anything like that I&#39;ve never had what
are other things you can have but imp
plant I mean I I would be so flattered
if somebody thought I had a BBL that if
I could I would I I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t
have the extra body fat I would get it
done if I could dumb truck and that that
surgery is such a hard one to recover
from it&#39;s so insane it&#39;s basically like
3 months you have to lay flat on your
you&#39;re bruised for an eternity if I were
to ever do that I would come out with I
I would be like if I&#39;m going to survive
that surgery you&#39;re going to give me an
ass that&#39;s like an anomaly like I&#39;m
you&#39;re I&#39;m going to walk through a park
and I&#39;m going to turn around and
everyone is going to be whispering and
laughing and talking because they&#39;re
like what what are we looking at like
circus freak that if I&#39;m going through
that healing process you&#39;re going to do
it I want that I&#39;m not coming out with
like oh she been has she been like
really hitting the gym lately extra
squats no I want it to be massive yeah
it&#39;s got to be it&#39;s got to stop people
in their
tracks okay but I don&#39;t have the body
fat to do that so that&#39;s never going to
happen but at the time when when in the
future you can take donated fat from
people I will be doing that and you will
be seeing this situation this situation
go down in the park okay what you have
had what I have had done like I said I
had my boobs done when I was
21 or 22 I had them redone after I was
done breastfeeding my kids because I
don&#39;t know where they went but they went
and then I had to have them redone very
recently because the first set I didn&#39;t
have enough body fat to disguise you
could see the Rippling of the implant so
I had to switch them out to this set I
don&#39;t like surgery my body does not
react well to general anesthesia and so
when I go to have a surgery it&#39;s a very
big deal and I have my all my doctors
have to meet with me before and have to
tell me if they&#39;ve seen any Omens if
they saw any owls crows if anyone
stepped on a spider if any of there are
any dead insects like my doctors have to
go through this with me because I&#39;m very
afraid of dying under general anesthesia
so I don&#39;t take surgery lightly and
therefore I have not had many of them
because of that so that&#39;s probably a
saving grace that I have this paranoia
or this fear because God knows what I
would have been up to do your doctors
think you&#39;re insane they&#39;re like oh this
love no they love me they yes I saw an
owl Megan let&#39;s reschedule we we all and
by the way I&#39;m like I&#39;ll still pay for
the surgery just do not also make sure
the music playlist no music comes up
that reminds you of like your
ex-girlfriend or an ex-wife or anything
that&#39;s going to make you upset because
you&#39;re the surgeon you need to be in a
good head space if you have a fight with
your wife do not come in for surgery I
go through all of these protocols
because you should make us all like a
list of a little pre op situation you
don&#39;t want to any surgery is a risk to
your life I don&#39;t care what anyone says
that&#39;s the going under general
anesthesia is a risk to your life so um
when I had to go in for this set I was
like look if you&#39;re going to put me to
sleep if I&#39;m going to be sick for two
months from the general anesthesia if
I&#39;m going to feel if I&#39;m going to go
through because I&#39;m not fully ever
asleep so my soul&#39;s like fighting on the
surgical table to wake up it&#39;s a very
traumatizing experience for me I was
like I better wake up with the biggest
boobs you can fit in my body and that is
what he said he did and they&#39;re not even
that big they&#39;re a
32d which is not that big they just look
big on my body cuz my body&#39;s tiny right
right but if like if he could have gone
bigger I would have had him go bigger
because I don&#39;t like surgery and the
fact that I had to do it I was like I
want a reward for the suffering I have
to go through I don&#39;t want to wake up
with a full beup there&#39;s no [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
point in that I&#39;m not doing it right you
want titties I wanted titties I said I
want I don&#39;t care what&#39;s on Trend give
me 19 1990 stripper titties that&#39;s what
I want and he did it girl you look
amazing thank you and then um I had my
nose done when I was in my early 20s and
that&#39;s something I&#39;ve literally been
accused of having like six seven eight
rhinoplasty surgeries which is
impossible your nose would get necrosis
and fall off um I haven&#39;t had a
rhinoplasty since I
was I&#39;m going to say 23 it&#39;s been well
over a decade I haven&#39;t not touched my
nose since then we didn&#39;t Contour my
nose we didn&#39;t Contour my nose did no we
didn&#39;t your nose looks tiny shut the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up we didn&#39;t Contour you&#39;re should
we Contour it half should we show
everyone how I Contour my nose shut the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up you your nose looks no I can
make it tiny like a little Elven
princess I make it so small within
within one inch of its life I contoured
and so I think people think I keep
constant working on it it is just the
Contour I can&#39;t believe I can&#39;t believe
I&#39;m doing an interview without nose
Contour on I&#39;m traumatized you don&#39;t
understand what a big deal this is this
is like me not having done my eyebrows
it&#39;s very scary for me I&#39;m traumatized
that you think that your nose won&#39;t look
good right now cuz I&#39;m like the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
does my nose look like I like to I like
to Contour it down until it&#39;s just
nostrils like Voldemort just no nose
just just two holes here wait after this
how you Contour your nose and I&#39;ll do it
next to you yeah but I&#39;m I&#39;m freaking
out that I&#39;m not I don&#39;t have it on you
look so gorgeous you&#39;re going to keep
going this is good for you this is good
for you she&#39;s got to keep going okay so
you&#39;ve had your nose done you&#39;ve had
your tits done and what Botox and Feller
that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s it right oh there&#39;s
one thing I had done that I&#39;m
gatekeeping because sorry what it was it
was really good and it&#39;s not a known
like plastic surgery people don&#39;t even
really know about it will you tell me
off camera yeah you don&#39;t need it I
don&#39;t think really you you&#39;re not going
to want it I wanted it very badly and I
needed to do it and it&#39;s something that
can you give us a hint no no okay so
that&#39;s it yeah it&#39;s actually not that
much it&#39;s not that in terms of surgery
it&#39;s not that much now when it comes to
lasers and stuff like that I&#39;ve done
everything you could possibly think of
doing and I always will I don&#39;t
understand the point of shaming people
for getting stuff done granted I not
encouraging anyone to do anything crazy
and like I said you need to be very safe
and very careful when you do any of the
stuff even fillers like people that get
fillers in their nose you can get
necrosis from that like none of the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
is really safe it all comes with a risk
so I&#39;m not encouraging people to just go
out like blindly and do things you
should do your research however it&#39;s a
very weird thing to shame somebody for
and coming back to your question about
sex the more more that I&#39;ve taken
control of my body and done the things
that I&#39;ve always wanted to do the more
comfortable I am in my body and the more
freedom I have sexually and the more
embodied I feel sexually and I&#39;m more
like playful and confident in that way
versus when I was wearing a body that
didn&#39;t feel like my body because I
always wanted it to be different yeah I
appreciate you sharing that though
because I think you&#39;re right it&#39;s like
to the women that are shaming women for
getting work done if you are so
triggered that probably means you have
an insecurity where have you maybe
you&#39;ve thought of getting fillers or
Botox or something but maybe you&#39;re too
scared so then you shame women that have
done it it&#39;s like why if and if you
don&#39;t want it why do you care if another
woman gets it it&#39;s all projection when
someone is so angry looking at you it&#39;s
it is based in some form of jealousy
like we have to just call it what it is
but also where does the logic end of
like what why won&#39;t you take it to
shaming people for coloring their hair
so true you know what I&#39;m saying or
wearing gel nails or where does that
logic stop what&#39;s what&#39;s natural enough
for you and then what&#39;s fake and what&#39;s
the barometer and like why do we all
have to follow some kind of a standard
it doesn&#39;t make any sense like can we
talk about your book for a second yeah
so you released your book pretty boys
are poisonous and you basically write
about the fact that you have your entire
life kept the secrets of men which again
if anyone asks like why it&#39;s like we
kind of talked about that today it&#39;s
like well what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you&#39;re G if you
say it No One Believes you or they shame
you or they call you a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like
there&#39;s certain reasons why women don&#39;t
come forward and say these things and
you wrote a lot in this book one of the
things one of the common themes I wrote
down was like throughout the book you
talk talk about minimizing yourself in
order to make a man or men feel
comfortable and confident and
important when was the first time you
remember doing that in a relationship
like bringing yourself down so tricky
because my relationships are public so
it&#39;s hard to say but I would say very
early on like when I first
started going to award shows and things
like that
feeling judged
for like my naive excitement over like
first experiencing some kind of success
or like being at like oh my God I&#39;m at
the MTV Awards like whoa this is so cool
and not being met with um what felt to
be criticism or judgment and then me
shrinking and receiving the message that
it was embarrassing to like these things
things or to be happy to be a part of
these things and that I needed to quell
that and reject it maybe MH have you
ever had someone
that like had a very strong opinion to
be like you&#39;re not allowed to wear that
don&#39;t be like as outgoing in at events
like how controlling have you
experienced relationships become I
haven&#39;t had somebody um control
clothing and things like that um but
definitely yeah definitely just down to
like maintaining too much eye contact
with someone else or having um being too
curious during a conversation or to the
point where it&#39;s like well I just won&#39;t
talk to anyone I just won&#39;t look at
anyone I won&#39;t Shake anyone&#39;s hand like
I&#39;ll just sit and that&#39;s that&#39;s one of
the poems you&#39;re referring to is I think
it was the art of becoming an accessory
and feeling like an accessory where I&#39;m
there but why am I there and what am I
doing I don&#39;t have like I don&#39;t have a
presence here because I&#39;m not allowed to
be another theme is toxicity in the book
I wanted to read you this particular
line I prefer the agonizing
psychological abuse of this trauma bond
to the prosaic tedium of a regular
life why do you think you gravitate
towards toxicity over
stability because stability sounds
boring Megan it does and that&#39;s the
truth it sounds like it&#39;s not romantic
it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s
passionate the literal definition of
passion is to
suffer and it doesn&#39;t it just sounds I
would rather be in something this is not
to encourage others to do this but my
personal psychosis and issue is that I
would prefer to be in something dramatic
and toxic versus
something stable keep in mind I&#39;ve never
experienced like truly stable so if I
were to honestly experience it I would
probably have a lot of peace and would
accept it yeah but I&#39;ve never had it so
to me the idea of it sounds very boring
boring I want to read part of this
heartbreaking poem that you wrote
Because it&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] heartbreaking you
say there was a time where I had never
heard a man call me stupid pathetic
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] idiot and there was also
a time when I had never felt a man&#39;s
hands hit me suffocate me or throw me to
the ground but now if one of those
things hasn&#39;t happened by Wednesday I
consider it a miracle when I read that
to you
you how does it make you
feel I dissociate from the physical
violence a lot even when I talk to my
therapist I have yet to be able to have
like a strong emotional reaction to that
because I
compartmentalized that and that sort of
just jumped over my my my logic my
logical brain and went right into my
body so I need to probably do a lot of
like sematic therapy to work on that but
I I&#39;m not able to feel emotional when I
write about it or when I talk about it
it&#39;s basically like describing a movie
um the gaslighting and the name calling
and the mental emotional abuse I do get
very emotional about that I I am very
like present with that but how do I feel
about it I don&#39;t know well part of me
feels like exposed because I wrote this
book with with things like that in it
and so to hear someone else read it I&#39;m
like okay I wrote that for every want to
read for all of eternity they can
revisit that book and I did it but I did
it for a reason why did you do it one
for myself I think because obviously it
was therapeutic to get it out and to get
it out in a way that&#39;s different than to
just talk to a therapist and like the
words float away into nothingness to put
it into a book I know that it&#39;ll find
even if it&#39;s only one person it&#39;ll find
someone that needs to read it and they
will experience some kind of healing or
some kind of inspiration from it and
therefore that gave my pain a purpose
versus me just trying to heal
privately um it also just felt like a
demon that I needed to have exercised
from my body like I needed to I needed
to get it out in this way do you
remember the first time that a man hit
yes I can&#39;t I don&#39;t know that I can
tell the story I have to be so careful
no of course of course I guess I could
just ask like once something happens
more than once mhm there&#39;s a way that
you can almost I don&#39;t want to say like
normalize it but you have you do you
acclimate to it yeah when it happened
the first
time do you remember your reaction and
like how you handled it and mooved yeah
I fawned
that was my initial reaction of freeze
fight flight Fawn fawning is like it&#39;s a
combination of freezing and then also
attempting to soothe the other person so
that was my initial reaction and it was
very it was definitely shocking but like
I said I almost immediately
compartmentalized it and went into
the like took on went into nurturing the
other person
to like calm the situation and I don&#39;t
know I just I just took it on as my own
burden right away instead
of feeling the trauma mhm but I think
that&#39;s like really relatable and that&#39;s
how [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up it is to be a woman like
we&#39;re trained to like make men feel un
like you&#39;re it&#39;s okay like make them
feel comfortable also because I think
it&#39;s a survival mechanism because if you
can deescalate a situation with a man
you you don&#39;t know how much far that
that was going to go so our brain goes
to it&#39;s like I was talking to my
therapist about this the other day she
was like I call it like the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
effect it&#39;s like when you&#39;re about to
get sexually abused or something&#39;s about
to happen it&#39;s like you can rationalize
like okay if I just give him a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
that will stop me from having to have
sex with him and then people will shame
you of like you gave him a oh so then
but so you did do it&#39;s like you don&#39;t
know what&#39;s going to happen they could
have a gun they could try to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
kill you we we know what men are capable
of and so there&#39;s moments where it&#39;s
just survival
again I think it&#39;s such a privileged
standpoint when people would be like
what do you mean you soothed him I know
exactly what you mean you immediately go
into survival mode of how do I
completely deescalate the
situation the poem you wrote called
rape did anyone in your life know that
you had survived that type of sexual
abuse before you wrote this poem
yeah not my parents or like my family
but people that I&#39;ve been with like have
known yeah did your family reach out to
you once the book came out no
interesting mhm did that shock you
no I&#39;m so sorry that&#39;s okay I mean
that&#39;s but that&#39;s telling of the
relationship yeah that&#39;s that perfectly
reflects as I would anticipate it too
yeah we&#39;re going to move on to your
relationship a little bit okay okay Mr

book has a lot of heavy topics and I
know you clarified on
multiple um interviews you did like I&#39;m
not just writing about one person I&#39;m
talking about my life experience but how
did that book just like impact your
relationship in the moment did it open
wounds did you have to have a lot of
conversations like I can imagine it was
tough yeah and because some of the poems
are about him and they&#39;re obviously
about him like yeah a 32-year-old
narcissist attempts to quantify his
crimes is very is about him and he knows
it&#39;s about him and there are other ones
like ghosts of Christmas future
obviously about him um but I also didn&#39;t
really write anything about him that he
hasn&#39;t said about himself in his own
music however that doesn&#39;t make it any
less sensitive for him to
experience me writing about it because
obviously he feels in control when he&#39;s
telling his own story story or even like
maybe he&#39;s able to hide behind the music
a little bit even though he&#39;s saying all
the same things it felt different in in
this format so obviously he would have
to be asked for his experience but it
was not easy and I think he was like
really nervous and and worried because
there&#39;s a lot of explosive content in
the book obviously and there was some
fear there and also I mean some of them
are about him and are Savage they are
Megan they definitely are
they&#39;re go read the book everyone I feel
like everyone has such like an opinion
on your guys relationships you know you
got engaged then I think it was called
off then we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on
with you like how would you describe
your relationship with
MGK um I
think that what I&#39;ve learned from being
in this relationship is that it&#39;s not
for public consumption so I think as of
now I don&#39;t have a comment on like the
status of the relationship per se what I
can say is that is what I refer to as
being my twin soul and there will always
be a tether to him no matter what I I
can&#39;t say for sure what the capacity
will be but I will always be connected
to him somehow beyond that I&#39;m not
willing to
explain but all those those things you
said were accurate things that have
occurred and I could see them being
confusing or interesting to people and
them being like what&#39;s up yeah I mean I
yeah I think the reality is like reading
your book I was like holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] this
is some of this is traumatizing this is
scary this is sad this
is really relatable like I think and I
think that&#39;s what you just explained you
wanted to do with the book is like I
think a lot of women which is
unfortunate and sad for us as women that
a lot of people can be like uh-huh I&#39;ve
exp experienced that and that and that
and I think what&#39;s sad is like so many
people probably don&#39;t know how many
women have gone through that how many
women have normalized getting hit or
getting verbally physically emotionally
abused like it&#39;s it&#39;s everywhere it&#39;s
one in three women like it&#39;s so [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
prevalent and I think think our culture
likes to just turn a blind eye and
pretend it&#39;s not happening so like I
appreciate you writing the book but I
agree I think a lot of people are like
you you okay like are we still in this
relationship and that&#39;s for you to
decide like I don&#39;t think I think you&#39;re
right it&#39;s like for no everyone [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] off
you&#39;re going to decide what you&#39;re going
to do and also he gets to write his
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] music yeah and I think you as an
actor it&#39;s not like you get to be like
let&#39;s change this role to be more like
this like this is a an expression for
you that I bet was was like healing in a
way to be like G put it out and let it
go yeah it also was written just from
the like one angle of my perspective
meaning this was me being like I&#39;m
writing this from my anger of all these
men all these experiences that I have
had it&#39;s not an objective view of my
roles in the relationship like I said
like I failed many times inside the
different relationships and was not a
flawless yeah I I was not a pure victim
like I did plenty of things and and
provoked plenty of things not in terms
of violence but like I provoked pain or
issues inside the relationship as well
with my behavior but the book was not
written in a holistic Way It Was Written
from my anger and my pain needed to
speak and that&#39;s what the book is yeah
okay I have a couple more fun questions
okay first of all because we&#39;re going to
transition and help the girlies out okay
how have you gotten to a place in your
life where you do not give a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] about
what other people think in their
opinions I have not gotten to that place
in my life oh wait Megan I thought you
did no no no no we still care no I I I I
guess like I said earlier it is a thing
of like I would never change anything
about myself to appease someone like
publicly I would never do that I
actually had to one time dying Brian was
in a custom C case with his his child
and sometimes a part of those a part of
the process is everybody has to do a
psych evaluation so all four adults had
to go undergo psychiatric evaluations
and mine came back and they took note of
the fact that I was one of the only
people that had never attempted to slant
the test because it&#39;s human nature to
want your best self to be seen so when
people are being tested it&#39;s often that
they will not lie per se but mislead or
like present present a truth that isn&#39;t
entirely accurate out of wanting to be
liked and I don&#39;t have that function or
that mechanism so I they took note of
the fact that that was completely absent
from my my psych evaluation but not in a
like sociopath
way but in a
way where I&#39;m just not somebody who&#39;s
going to bend unless I I&#39;m I&#39;m only
doing what I believe in the end like
that will never change but that doesn&#39;t
mean that it doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings
when people spew Venom or negativity or
hatred towards me I&#39;m very permeable
actually because I&#39;m very sensitive and
yes I&#39;ve been wearing that armor but the
armor is heavy and at a certain point in
my life I I was down to get some blood
on my blade and like go to war if I
needed to but I&#39;m tired now and it it&#39;s
it&#39;s actually wearing on me a lot in
this particular moment for whatever
reason things are coming to a head for
me and I&#39;m not in a place where I don&#39;t
give a single [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I do get hurt that
won&#39;t change who I am and how I am and
how I speak and how I proceed with my
life but I do still feel the pain of
that how do you as a mother handle
knowing people are like like going to
try to get at your kids through you and
knowing you like are you paranoid at all
with that yeah I lose a lot of sleep
about that especially because at least
one of them is I know going to
be in the public probably all three of
them they&#39;re like Drop Dead Gorgeous
kids and I you know they both of their
parents are actors and in this industry
so it&#39;s likely that they&#39;re going to
have some type of public platform at a
at a certain point I I worry about that
every day do you talk to them about that
yet not yet my oldest is 11 and my kids
were not allowed they weren&#39;t raised
with screens and they don&#39;t have iPads
or anything like that at my house or
phones event I can&#39;t keep that up
forever eventually that will happen I&#39;m
trying to delay it as long as possible
but when they get a little bit older
it&#39;s still too early and it&#39;s also I
don&#39;t want to put the weight of my
experience on them yeah I want them to
have their own experience and I don&#39;t
want to preload it by being like this is
all the suffering that mommy&#39;s been
through this is how the world treats mom
mommy you know mommy&#39;s Never Been Loved
Mommy&#39;s always been bullied Mommy&#39;s
always mommy doesn&#39;t belong like they
don&#39;t need to feel that so I haven&#39;t
found the right way to talk to them
about that but I will have to with
certainty and yes I lose a lot of sleep
about that somebody should ask Brian
that question he&#39;s he he&#39;s watched me
cry so many times he&#39;s always like are
you okay because every school meeting
I&#39;m just weeping like I&#39;m always crying
because I know what&#39;s coming and I&#39;m not
able to live in this moment because I
know what&#39;s ahead and I&#39;m I&#39;m not
prepared emotionally to have to do it I
can&#39;t do it it&#39;s a lot yes okay you&#39;re
going to give the girls I thought you
said there were fun question it&#39;s right
here right here right here okay you are
funny by the way thank you we should do
like a part two where we only talk about
funny [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] we just let you go okay I
want to get your take on a couple of
scenarios okay what would you say to
someone who and then like it&#39;s a girl
going through it okay this girl sees a
hot guy at a bar but is too nervous to
go up to him and make the first move
what would you say to her it&#39;s not going
to be worth it
me it&#39;s not you&#39;re like you&#39;re the same
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that&#39;s getting [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in your
mouth like go home it&#39;s not going to be
worth it go home it&#39;s not going to be
good would you ever go up and approach a
guy I can&#39;t be bothered it&#39;s not what do
they give you
really what do you get out of it really
sorry have you ever gotten a magical
dick have you ever
been gotten a sacred [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] down where
you&#39;re like a better human
afterwards have you because if you have
please tell please tell me but in my
experience that&#39;s not what happens and
it&#39;s not worth the drama that they bring
and they cause it&#39;s not worth it your
dick needs to be in direct proportion to
the drama that you
caused and if it&#39;s not then you need to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] off oh my they&#39;d be so
little or they&#39;d be huge there would be
no like medium boyfriend siiz dicks
anymore right wait how did you meet
Coulson did he go up to you oh no oh no
no for the audience I did not connect
those things so I just want to make sure
that those that&#39;s not an ongoing ation
of the sentence yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes but how did you meet him did you go
to him met I met him on set and we were
in a scene together write the music
video no no no it was before that we
were doing a movie that will forever be
upset that we&#39;re we met on the set of
that movie but we were doing a scene and
um I had seen his picture before he
showed up and I knew just from his
picture I was like I recognized that
person and then I looked in his eyes and
I was like oh yeah it&#39;s you I&#39;ve known
you for thousands of years
so we were in a situation where it
wasn&#39;t really about one person coming up
to the other got he&#39;s very shy and he&#39;s
he&#39;ll tell you he&#39;s very awkward as well
so he&#39;s not somebody who like picks up
girls he&#39;s just gorgeous and a famous
musician so he gets them easily but if
if he was not famous he would be
struggling because he&#39;s
not he&#39;s not good at that he isn&#39;t he&#39;s
a brilliant musician he&#39;s not good at
picking up girls or conversation are you
good at got
it I would
say that&#39;s so subjective but no I don&#39;t
think I&#39;m good at it because I don&#39;t
like to I don&#39;t flirt I see how girls
flirt I don&#39;t like I can&#39;t be bothered
to do that I also asked them questions
they&#39;ve never been asked before that
they don&#39;t want to answer like like what
like the questions you&#39;re asking me and
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] we&#39;re talking about now where I&#39;m
like what&#39;s your deepest mother wound
like no no guy likes to talk about that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] especially right away when they
don&#39;t know you right you&#39;re like let&#39;s
talk about what happened what happened
in the childhood they&#39;re like huh yeah
what are you most traumatized by what&#39;s
your weirdest fetish what&#39;s your like
yeah they don&#39;t they don&#39;t like to feel
exposed so I&#39;m not a good you&#39;re not a
good I&#39;m not good at that because they
just want you to be pretty and really
dumb and I don&#39;t like to play that game
I agree what if a girl keeps comparing
herself to her best friend how do you
stop comparing yourself to women that&#39;s
a great question I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve
ever been in that you mean it from like
a standpoint of jealousy comparing to or
en more of like an Envy because there&#39;s
so many it could have a venomous element
or it could just be like wow I&#39;m really
proud of my best friend I wish I could
get my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] together and be like that
there&#39;s different aspects to it one I
think is not necessarily unhealthy to be
inspired by your friend and to take
notes and want to move in that direction
but if it&#39;s unhealthy and it&#39;s toxic I
don&#39;t know that I have great advice like
you have to start working on yourself
and because you have insecurities and
things that you you need to heal and
probably desires that need to be
satiated and all of these other things
that that you need to work on because
jealousy will always be there with your
friend or
with just all others sucks okay what if
a girl is hung up on a guy who ghosted
her after a date what do we do mag
again I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t be friends
with that
person you can&#39;t be friends with the
no no what do you
mean is that
rude I can&#39;t be friends with that
person she&#39;s upset after she went on a
date with a guy one time and he ghosted
her and she still is obsessing over him
yes you can&#39;t be friends with
I can&#39;t do that that wasn&#39;t the
question you&#39;re like I cannot be friends
with oh my God I&#39;m peeing okay we&#39;re not
friends with her okay what about a girl
that&#39;s too afraid to tell her partner
that she&#39;s never had an
orgasm you got to just you got to do
that you got to you got to say that
that&#39;s that is I feel like all of us
have been in that position at one time
or another
that is not worth living like that
though you
cannot what is the fear that he&#39;s going
to feel so insecure or so overwhelmed
how would you do it is the question
specifically I&#39;ve never had an orgasm
with you or I&#39;ve never had an orgasm
with you that&#39;s a different
question I think how long has it been
I&#39;m making this up well if it&#39;s been a
week versus 10 years
it&#39;s been like a year oh that&#39;s a long
time because now you&#39;re a
liar that&#39;s that&#39;s a long time to keep
up that lie cuz now you&#39;re a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
liar you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] no but now you have to
answer for well why have you been lying
for a year like don&#39;t let it get to that
point I understand the fear of being
intimidated or worrying or whatever you
can&#39;t live like that you have to
understand the a orgasm if he&#39;s entitled
to an orgasm you are entitled to an
orgasm the end so don&#39;t let anything any
kind of fear talk you out of being able
to speak that truth this is your body
and orgasms actually keep women very
healthy it&#39;s a vitamin and you have to
prioritize that so don&#39;t be afraid and
if he has a problem with that he is not
for you and I promise you the dick
wasn&#39;t that good anyway obviously
because you&#39;re not
coming amen okay Megan last question
what do you do you think this next
chapter of your life will look like for
you I feel like you&#39;re about to
disappear this is the last we ever saw
Megan fo I am on like the Cliff of that
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I&#39;m either going to
really have some kind of like
Breakthrough where I do transcend into
some like Blissful higher level of
Consciousness or find some kind of
purpose being in service to people or I
will disappear again I feel like I
handled that wrong the first time though

lost so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll repeat that
