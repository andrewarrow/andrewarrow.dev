Most people know me for Numpai. Numpai
became much more popular because it&#39;s
more generic. It does more. But the
story really starts with sci-fi and it
really started in that 1999 time frame.
I would say it started with a little
module I wrote called NumPy IO. I just
needed to load medical imaging data
files. So there&#39;s this diccom format and
I was part of a research lab at the Mayo
Clinic that was doing a project called
analyze. Analyze was a software that
took different data sets and it could
run on multiple machines and it let
researchers manipulate those data in
three dimensions. I was trying to extend
it. I was trying to use Python to do
similar kinds of activities. So how do I
do that? Well, I could write an
extension for Python to read that those
A guy named Michael Miller had written a
project called Table IO and he made it
open source so he just published his
work and I could see it download it very
liberally licensed didn&#39;t have any kind
of stipulation if he used it I had to do
something and sell my firstborn child or
you know send him letters or anything I
could just use it took table IO modified
it and released numpio that was my very
first open source module I put out in
the net I made a little web page really
ugly looking web page and I said here&#39;s
numpio if you want to read any data here
it is and uh I got some feedback on it
and it was amazing. It started that
trend. That was the very first thing
that got me that educated me how to do
it. Wasn&#39;t super popular with a lot of
people. But then later I started needing
more things like, oh, I need to be able
to solve block equations for my MRI
simulator. And so, oh, where do I get
that? I found OD pack. It&#39;s a 4R
library. So, I just wrapped it into
Python, made it available, and pushed
that out on the on the world and called
it OD pack. Then I did a 4R integration
quadpack. And I did a special functions
library called it cifes. I mean I just
did a series of independent modules
because Python was extensible because
you extend it with native code. In this
case forrren libraries that I integrated
to Python. I just basically by in 1999
ended up with six or seven different
packages that I put out there as
different modules. They were pulled
together in something called multiack.
Very generic, not much brand awareness.
By start of the year 2000, we had kind
of a growing collection of tools that
somebody could use for science, but they
were hard to get. There were all these
different modules. You had to pull them
together. And then a high school student
named Robert Robert Kerna actually I
didn&#39;t know he was high school student
at the time. Actually, what he did
though is he said, &#34;Oh, here&#39;s some
interesting scientific modules. Let me
take them.&#34; And he built Windows
installers for them. Which was a lot of
work. And he said, &#34;Hey, here&#39;s the
multiack distribution on a Windows .exe.
you can just click here and install it.
Well, as soon as that became available,
the number of users of MultiPack went up
by a factor of 100. All of a sudden, a
lot more people started using the
software. And so that was like, oh yeah,
I guess distribution matters. I guess
making it easy to install matters. Of
course it does, but you know, I&#39;m not
thinking about that. I&#39;m just thinking
about sharing my work with scientists.
Eventually, a man contacted me by the
name of Eric Jones. Eric Jones was a
researcher at Duke at the time and he
had written a few other modules. He was
working on a multiple problem with
Forran code. So he was one of the people
that started to use these tools for his
own research and then said, &#34;Hey,
there&#39;s an opportunity here.&#34;
He and his friend started a company
called Enth at the time and they wanted
to also create this ecosystem of
scientific libraries and pull them
together and so we we organized the
SciPai library in 2001. really sci-fi
was kind of a distribution of Python
modules trying to make it easy for
somebody who&#39;s a researcher to get all
the stuff installed start using it and
we did it as a single library but it
really was a distribution of Python
masquerading as a single library
it was also an ecosystem so scypi.org
was created and on scip.org or it became
kind of a focal point kind of a
gathering point for the scientific
ecosystem in Python and then
particularly what helped is a conference
series was started in 2001
the story of NumPy really starts at that
sci-fi conference as well about the time
of 2001 the folks from the Hubble space
science telescope had adopted Python to
do their image processing of the images
coming back from the satellite but the
array at the time was something called
numeric and it was written by Jim
Hugenan who was a grad student at the
time at MIT and Scypi was basically
built using numeric arrays. So all the
arrays in sci-fi were numeric arrays. So
it was getting a large number of
dependencies. A lot of people were using
numeric. I was it was quite I was quite
familiar with numeric. But the folks at
at SC at the space science telescope
needed more from the array. I needed
needed them to be faster and they&#39;re
small faster when they&#39;re bigger. They
needed better scale. They needed um to
be able to update them differently. They
needed to have fancy indexing. They
needed to have certain capabilities that
weren&#39;t available. they needed things to
be improved in numeric and so they had
started work on their own array library
called num array. About 2004
uh a project came out called ND image.
ND image was a really interesting uh
library especially for somebody trained
in medical imaging like I was. And the
image had tools for medical scientists,
medical imaging scientists that I
wanted. I wanted in scypi, but he had
written them. Very well done actually.
It&#39;s a very nice library, but it used
numeray. And so all of a sudden, I&#39;m
seeing a world where, oh wait, sci-fi&#39;s
here with its libraries built on
numeric. And now there&#39;s this really
good library and others going to follow
suit that use numay. And now we have
this split ecosystem. So we have kind of
a divided world. And the challenge at
the time was the data couldn&#39;t be
shared. So once you had your data in a
number array, you&#39;d have to copy it out
into a numeric array in order to use it
for sci-fi. So all of a sudden, you
know, if you want to mix and match these
two array libraries, you&#39;d be having
potentially multiple copies of the same
data in memory. I started using Python
because I was concerned about memory. If
you&#39;re doing large amounts of data for
image processing, volume processing, you
can have gigabytes of data. I was a
professor. Third year, they have a
review. Do a get tenure. you&#39;re on the
right track. And the review came back
and said, &#34;Yeah, you&#39;re doing okay, but
you&#39;re spending a lot of time on this
open source stuff and maybe you should
spend less time on that and more time on
getting grants and writing papers.&#34; So,
I just received that from my department
chair. Essentially, a few months later,
I started to write numpy.
Why? Because I saw this split and I was
like, &#34;This is not good. This is going
to mean that we can&#39;t cooperate as
easily and we&#39;ll have we need to kind of
come together.&#34; And I went, &#34;Well, who
can help do this?&#34; this cuz and I talked
a few people about it like hey how do we
get on the same page and lots of people
were willing like talk is everyone will
talk the same way everyone agrees to do
stuff talking but actually doing is a
lot more rare actually eventually I was
like well I think I&#39;m one of the few
people in the world that can do this
because I know numeric really well I
know nam I I could I had a light
teaching load one one semester where I
had just a research class I was teaching
and that class fell through so I
essentially had no class teaching load
and I went oh well maybe I can do this
and so maybe I can write a numpy that is
takes numeric adds the features of num
array and unites the communities for the
first 6 months pretty much um I just had
to I was just myself doing a lot of work
to try to okay how do I do this how do I
actually get the features how do I build
big fancy indexing work a lot of stuff
and it was stretching me it was
stretching me from a algorithmic
perspective it was stretching me from a
computer science perspective it was fun.
It was amazing. Um, but there were a lot
of things I really wished I&#39;d had some
adult supervision, so to speak. Uh,
somebody with more experience to kind of
help guide some of the decisions. Uh,
there were some decisions made and some
of those I made, some of those were made
in conjunction with others that came to
the project later. We just made the bad,
we just made the wrong decision. That&#39;s
going to happen, I guess. But this is
where the more input you have, the more
experience you have, the more you can
avoid some of those um later obvious
decisions. I mean, some decisions you
wouldn&#39;t have known, the unknown
unknowns, things that you wouldn&#39;t have
couldn&#39;t have possibly known. But I&#39;m
talking about things that were knowable.
Things that were knowable if we&#39;d had
the right information from elsewhere.
That those are the part that I&#39;m
particularly like, ah, that&#39;s that&#39;s a
shame. It would have been nice if we
would have had better input at that
point. So about 6 to 8 months it took me
to write the first kind of alpha release
of NumPy. Takes another year to harden
it to actually get to where it&#39;s ready
to actually publicly release as a
version one. But about four months in, I
started to get some people going, &#34;Oh,
he&#39;s serious. This is going to happen.&#34;
And they started to help. Got a lot of
help from Robert Kern. Got a lot of help
from Charles Harris. One of the
challenges of NumPy is because it is a
hybrid uh library that&#39;s built from an
existing codebase numeric and added on
features from another. And then
furthermore, it had to support the user
bases of both. I had to take numeric
users and now Scypi was a massive
numeric user. So I had a benefit of like
if Scypi could do it, anybody else could
do it too. And so I but I also had to
support numeric users like NDI image to
help it so they and they had CC code and
the CC code had a C APIs that were
mirroring those C APIs they were used to
calling and that would call into a a
fundamental structure. So it was this
hybrid that was merging two groups. It
was that was the hardest part actually
that&#39;s that&#39;s took about a year to to
fit to fix. So for the next year and a
half basically I I spent a lot of time
on NumPy trying to get the first version
working get a lot of people together but
it really paid off. It really paid off.
Yes. Turned out my academic career
didn&#39;t flourish. That&#39;s why when it
came, you know, 3 years later to my
academic uh tenure application, I didn&#39;t
get it. I got um told to come back and
we&#39;ll try again. Even though it was
pretty clear NumPai was successful by
then, it was still, you know, not as
clear to everybody in the department. Um
but it it it&#39;s been my most wildly
successful contribution of anything I&#39;ve
ever done.
when I knew NumPai would be successful
is when I went to the sci-fi conference
and demoed it and actually when I
finished my presentation I got a
standing ovation at Caltech from about a
hundred of my scientific peers right and
never had that before or since never had
that and it was one of those moments in
life when you&#39;re like oh yeah I knew
this was important but I could see that
it was important and the reason NumPai
succeeded again not just because of me I
did a lot of work to get it started but
these other people started to come help
and as they started to come help. I
could see yes, okay, this is working.
And other people started to help. And
now today, Numpai is maintained by many,
many other people, not me.
