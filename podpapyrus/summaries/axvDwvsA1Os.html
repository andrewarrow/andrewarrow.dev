Very excited now to be joined by Shahed
Goreshi. He is a former State Department
employee who was sumearily fired
recently. Let&#39;s go and put this up there
on the screen. Fired this official over
internal debates over Israel. Geresi
recommended expressing condolences for
slain journalists in Gaza and exposing
the forced displacement of Palestinians.
According to documents reviewed, he was
then fired days later. So, Shide, thank
you so much for joining us on the show.
We appreciate it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Glad to be here. All right. So, uh,
let&#39;s start off with the top. You were
recently fired from the State
Department. The State Department says
that they won&#39;t comment, but they&#39;re
basically accusing you of leaking. Uh,
it appears that a lot of this comes down
to internal debates over Israel. First
and foremost was about this journalist
statement. So, why don&#39;t you describe
this statement, what it was, and why you
think it got it, why it got you fired.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. So, uh, Sunday, August 10th, we
got the breaking news that Anas and his
colleagues were killed in Gaza while uh,
sleeping in a tent. Uh it&#39;s very common
when you&#39;re in a press officer to
receive one-off questions from
reporters, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um so we we got one submitted is what&#39;s
your response? A general open-ended,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Somebody like me is like, &#34;Hey,
what&#39;s the department government&#39;s
response?&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And when you read an article,
you you&#39;ll often read a State Department
spokesperson said X. That&#39;s usually just
us emailing one of the press office
emailing the op-ed or the uh journalist.
And so in that in that specific
instance, I drafted um we&#39;re still
gathering information, which is still
true, like it just broke. Uh and my
second bullet was we are sharing
condolences which is I think a human and
uh uh response that&#39;s also in line with
US interest like we do want to have that
line out there and immediately I was
told that we don&#39;t know what happened
and we don&#39;t know what he did so to
pause and then by tomorrow by the next
day August 11th which is a Monday uh
Israel said that he was Hamas and then
that was the line we ended up going with
um by the press briefing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. And so that how did that lead to
your firing though? This is the first
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. I think it was a buildup. So it
was that was the Sunday. Monday I
drafted a line saying we&#39;re against uh
force displacement of Gazins to South
Sudan. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh they cut that line out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh and I think that was some sort of
flag for them as well. And then by day
three, I think the the nail in the
coffin uh was me removing the line in
reference to Judea and Samaria um in my
press guidance. That was not in line
with anything the State Department had
been saying at the time, but it&#39;s
something that the senior officials at
Embassy Jerusalem wanted. So at that
point uh it was I was flagged up and by
uh Sunday I was gone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which senior officials and what is your
did they directly sort of confront you
about these um about you you know
expressing condolences for journalists
and saying it&#39;s the West Bank not in
Samaria by the way. Um what is your how
did you gain the understanding that
those are the reasons why they let you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. So, some of it&#39;s obviously the
Washington Post reporting, but from my
end uh it was uh David Milstein that was
often pushing a particular agenda in the
building and that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and this is Ambassador Huckabe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; senior adviser. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And he would often um uh ask for certain
lines or certain statements. I know the
Washington Post reported on the Ireland
statement and he would uh go around the
building try to get this through and it
was in a more basic level was very
annoying to like navigate his his his
request. In that particular uh instance
with the Jude and Samaria line, that&#39;s
not a line. Ambassador Huckabe is using
it, but it wasn&#39;t common for anyone in
DC to use it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Explain why. Why does that matter? Jude
and Samaria versus West Bank and Gaza.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because that was a raer for the
Palestinians living in in in the West
Bank. Uh and it also really undermines
uh our relationship with our partners in
the region. And al and third, it&#39;s for
an Israeli audience. So it makes sense
for Ambassador Huckabe to want to use
those terms.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. Um, and at that point, um, I I I
wasn&#39;t the only one in the building that
wanted that removed. And, uh, so I went
in, um, cut that line. The line we had
been using for the West Bank, which was,
you know, a very general response. It
was like, we support stability in the
West Bank, uh, which protects Israeli
security. And like saying we support
stability in the West Bank could be
perceived with someone who is a
pro-Israel hardliner as like somehow
maybe if you&#39;re in that mindset
condemning Israel cuz like you oh you&#39;re
saying that we&#39;re not we&#39;re making
unstable by doing this. I think that&#39;s
how it&#39;s perceived even though I think
it&#39;s a very standard
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; kind of simple line. Um and by the next
day, Wednesday, I was asked by uh people
in the spokes uh spokesperson office um
that who draft who tried to draft that
line and they wanted to connect with
Milstein to discuss it around me. So if
they&#39;re having discussions with Milstein
on Wednesday um and those three events
happened in a row and then on Thursday
and Friday which was my last happened my
last two days I didn&#39;t know it was odd
the question I was receiving um from
from senior number of uh people in
leadership in NEA um twice once Thursday
and again Friday morning was where did
that line on Monday come from about
force displacement I was like that line
on Monday that was like 4 days ago why
are you why are people asking about it 4
days later and I was asked to compile
like an entire history of where like the
evidence of how I cleared it. I was like
I have evidence of clearing this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and special envoy Wickoff and President
Trump technically said something similar
in the spring. So I&#39;m very in line with
what the administration had been saying.
Um and but that seemed to be the excuse
at that point.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you explain what is your
understanding of what the
administration&#39;s policy is visav Gaza?
Well, that&#39;s it&#39;s a good question
because I&#39;m moving forward with with my
firing, I think it&#39;s going to become
even more radical, which is I know
shocking, but I think the language is
going to lean into terms like Juda and
Samaria, or are we going to be more
passive on these uh uh force
displacement ethnic cleansing rumors
that are coming through? So, that&#39;s my
concern moving forward. Now, in the past
uh on uh West Bank or two-state
solution, we didn&#39;t really have a
straight response. Uh it was always,
hey, what&#39;s the review on Tuesday
solution? And it would be something like
President Trump understands how I don&#39;t
I can&#39;t I don&#39;t want to use the right uh
words, but it was like something like
it&#39;s messy, so we&#39;re not there right
now. We need things we need to uh to
release hostages and get
things settled.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So basically a deflection.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A deflection.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Okay. So now that you have been
fired, you can speak freely. How long
have you worked at state? How long have
you worked at?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; September 2024 was when I started.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. I I started as the uh this is not
what I was technically hired for, but
because of capacity issues, I ended up
covering uh Lebanon Jordan Press right
off the bat, which was a very um quick
start cuz Lebanon was very hot at the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Got it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh and then then in January, I was
officially asked to cover Israeli
Palestinian Affairs, which was odd. As a
contractor, I just started. You don&#39;t
typically put that person covering that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s very sensitive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So for your own person, so basically
what I&#39;d heard is, &#34;Oh, he&#39;s a Democrat.
Of course, you fired him.&#34; Like he
didn&#39;t. So what&#39;s your response to that?
That&#39;s not true because daytoday if I
was an activist in the building even the
quote that Tommy used in the Washington
Post piece that I was some activist I
would have been fired much quicker if
this to be short like if I was going in
fighting on every single line um that
would have hit up really quick red flags
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um I did there were flags I did make I
would go up to leadership and be like
hey like on the podium because I&#39;m only
controlling press lines I have no
influence or policy I&#39;m just controlling
language right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so give me an example
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um of like the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah like what something you would flag?
I was thinking I would flag like on the
day-to-day lines it was difficult cuz
I&#39;m going through a clearance process
but I would look back I would look at
the the guidance and I&#39;d be like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is um pretty hard line and I would
brief it like I was doing my job at the
same time I would go behind the scenes
and be like hey these lines are uh at
the very least they&#39;re not very
empathetic like when we&#39;re discussing
famine a month ago it I was worried that
the the language was just like you you
can if you want to do hardline uh
language on the podium you can
acknowledge that you&#39;re seeing horrific
photos before you you make your
argument. But that wasn&#39;t even
happening. So I was like we at the on
the strategic level there&#39;s a moral
imperative but on a strategic level just
is it looks terrible at the podium.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s let&#39;s talk a little bit more about
that moral imperative. We can put this
uh next element up on the screen. I
suspect you probably have seen this news
this morning. This is a just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; horrific video of um these are a
combination of journalists and medical
work personnel and um people who are
there trying to rescue people who are on
the scene. This is a double tap strike.
Um there&#39;s been a documented history of
the uh IDF using these double tap
strikes not only to kill whoever they
originally wanted to kill, but then to
kill any rescuers who are coming to the
scene. something that&#39;s been reported
You obviously part of what got you in
trouble was just the very basic, hey, we
express condolences for these
journalists who were killed and we know
there have been hundreds of journalists
who have been killed in the context of
um you know of the Israelis
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; targeting them inside of Gaza.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How as a professional did you grapple
with your own you know sort of moral
standing on this topic? And I don&#39;t say
this to put you on the spot. I&#39;m just
genuinely curious like daytoday as
someone who&#39;s trying to go in there and
do the best you can and figure out okay
what is the administration saying and
what is our line for journalists how are
you absorbing those images and how are
you thinking about your own sort of role
in this capacity
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s a very good question and in terms
of like my personal views they&#39;re
they&#39;re not wrong I just didn&#39;t show it
you know as often dayto-day when I was
doing my job so it was it was an issue
and it was something that like
particular colleagues I we would discuss
cuz I wasn&#39;t only one cuz it could be
the the Israel file but it could be in
another one too uh throughout the
building. So uh there was there was two
I think responses to that. One like I
said to the last thing was I was like
flagged with people in leadership that I
would trust that certain try to make
small changes. Um I do think those small
changes do matter not just because
you&#39;re an activist in the building but
because it&#39;s in line with US interests
because you can just be outside
protesting but you&#39;re not you&#39;re just
outside right. So I think that&#39;s that&#39;s
important to have that balance. Um and
then two u this is a very more strategic
uh response that I stepped back and
looked at President Trump&#39;s words and if
you look we we started with a ceasefire
um in that context
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um and in the region we were talking
with the Iranians for example. So I had
on a macro level some hopes that even
though these lines are are difficult
right now in this moment there could be
a chance that something could come about
but it was it was uh getting worse not
better by the summer
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because by June we&#39;re you know bombing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and uh now um the embassy Jerusalem
really took over the push back that I
did see a little bit.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s talk about that cuz that&#39;s what
I&#39;m curious about. There has been a
flipping right in the initial policy
from ceasefire talking with the Iranians
talking with Putin to now it&#39;s like the
opposite. So you talk about there the
embassy in Jerusalem. What was your
observation having seen that from the
inside? How did we go from Steve Wickoff
constantly going to Doha talking about
ceasefires or meeting with the Iranians
to then using that as cover to bomb them
and then also uh for basically allowing
Mike Huckabe to have cart blanch over
the Israel policy?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s good question. So on the White
House level, I can&#39;t say cuz President
Trump I don&#39;t know what phone calls he&#39;s
having dayto-day that like that&#39;s that&#39;s
shifting his direction. Yeah. But on on
my end, what I&#39;m noticing is people were
I remember people when when President
Trump was um uh elected, inaugurated,
people were happy that the Pompeo and
the Boltons and Nikki Haley&#39;s were gone.
All true. These are all positive
developments. Um and then you would see
you know Elon was talking to the uh uh
certain like the Iranians in one end and
um so there are these small and the
Wickoff wanted to make deals wanted to
end the war um in Ukraine wanted to end
the war in Gaza wanted to make a deal
with Iranians. So, I do think that the
personnel is still an issue. Like people
are are glad that yeah, John Bolton
might not be there, but having Secretary
Rubio and and Huckabe is kind of the
same thing, but a more sneaky level,
right? You don&#39;t it&#39;s not as
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in your face as Bolton,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but Secretary Rubio does kind of mirror
um some of uh President Trump&#39;s
language. Like he wants peace, he wants
to end wars, but you look at his team,
it&#39;s all like a number of Heritage
Foundation guys. Now, you can say it&#39;s
his prerogative. Of course, it&#39;s
President Trump won. He doesn&#39;t have
Heritage Foundation guys on his team,
but on foreign policy, that&#39;s not in
line with what his agenda was supposed
to be.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And the same thing goes with Ambassador
Huckabe there. So, um, they&#39;re going to
say that I was some political activist.
I think they&#39;re the political activists
that are undermining what President
Trump claimed to have wanted and
campaigned on initially.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Got it. Um, with regard to Huckabe, uh,
we saw one moment where there was a
little bit of push back from him on the
Israelis after they had, what was it?
They had like bombed a church, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. It was the Christians.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And, um, there was some sort of
statement that went out and then after
that, he just went back to being, you
know, totally on board with the most
extreme uh, versions of the the
Netanyahu government. from the inside,
what were the issues that were most
difficult for this administration to
grapple with? Because it seemed like,
yeah, when Christians were being killed
and attacked, that was one that was hard
for them to ignore and hard for them
just to accept. Were there other things
like that that you saw that were like,
you know, a little bit difficult for
them to just totally do the pro-Israel
spin on? the the Christian thing was the
only like Christians being targeted um
in a uh by by settlers in the West Bank
and the church in Gaza was the only time
I saw some verbal accountability. He
even had a statement I was like I was
shocked at the time that was like houses
of worship must be protected like in I
don&#39;t remember the exact language he
brought up mosques. I&#39;m like well
like there&#39;s more you can say there. Um
so that was the only accountability that
I saw. What was frustrating is that
every time there was a settler attack
that was horrific or the case with with
the journalists um or just your like
terrible air strike that killed x number
of Palestinians in Gaza, it was always
defer to Israel and so it was like well
we can defer to the government of Israel
to to explain their air strike.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well okay so then here&#39;s the question.
So did you work on any other countries
while you were on in state any other
portfolios you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it was it was uh it was Lebanon Jordan I
started for a few months um but that
shifted by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So based on your observation is there
any country else in the world that we
treat with the same level of difference.
Give me an example from on the inside.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No no so if there if someone had um an
issue we would we would like we would
always have our own like intelligence or
our own commentary on every issue. Now I
can&#39;t think of one um off the top of my
head but like in the Lebanon Jordan case
maybe um we would have a lot of our
lines had accountability like we would
say again it&#39;s a different
administration and again
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um there are issues there too obviously
but just terms of like language and
again I&#39;m working with words not with
policy so
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um I&#39;ll use that as an example um but
there would be um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; air strikes against like these Roman
ruins in Lebanon then they would be like
oh these sites need to be protected or
journalists must be protected
And um uh we would have those lines
built in very easily. It was very like
made sense.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But we&#39;re immediately like even the case
with us the line that I response was
like don&#39;t respond. We don&#39;t know what
he did. You&#39;re already preempting the
refer to Israel line. It&#39;s not like oh
let&#39;s check you could say
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; before they even came out from us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. We were even Yeah. They&#39;re
already saying what did he do? And so
it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s say you want you&#39;re
the government you&#39;re the US government.
You want to do your due diligence. You
don&#39;t want to go out. You don&#39;t have to
respond right away. um you&#39;re not
tweeting your policy. If you want to
say, &#34;Hey, let&#39;s give it 48 hours. We&#39;ll
check our sources and then on Tuesday at
the daily press briefing, then we&#39;ll
give condolences.&#34; That I would
understand, but they weren&#39;t even doing
that. It was like he probably did
something, you know, and then the next
day Israel comes out with those.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, it&#39;s just total difference on
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; total difference.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We we witnessed some of this publicly in
the context of the decision to um join
Israel in striking Iran. uh Tulsi
Gabbard famously testified, hey, you
know, we don&#39;t see any indication that
they&#39;re pursuing a nuclear weapon. Then
the justification given by the Trump
administration was actually reliant on
Israeli intelligence versus our own
intel assessment. You were you witness
to to any of that and how that played
out internally?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Well, it went from um there were
people like I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m not I wasn&#39;t
working on that file per se, but of
obviously you have your colleagues are
in the building. you talk to people
working on it uh and whatnot and what I
would hear is that from it went from um
certain people being like oh we&#39;re close
what the next steps were on the
negotiations to all of a sudden like oh
well um even certain people were closer
to the administration um like oh well
Iran didn&#39;t respond to our the deal we
had on the table that was like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like two weeks ago those same people
might have said like oh we&#39;re we might
get a deal done so it was quick to
follow it&#39;s a very like um on more macro
level, it&#39;s more like a MAGA thing,
right? You kind of like you&#39;re there
with them when the talks are happening,
you&#39;re there with them when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the the um bombs are dropping. So, but
on the on the level of the intelligence
and and Tulsi just on the on a personal
front, that was ridiculous cuz she
because they were automatically
undermining her own words from the I
think was a congressional um discussion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, from just months earlier, were
there people So, we talked about like
some of the problems and Huckabe
effectively taking over a lot of policy
visa v Israel. Were there people uh who
you worked with or who you you know
interacted with who were really trying
to take uh a different approach who were
upset about the um you know using
diplomacy with Iran as basically cover
to allow Israel to bomb them who were
you know looking to acknowledge
journalists shouldn&#39;t be murdered during
a war. Were there people who were
looking for that different approach and
who were committed to it um and you know
sort of fighting that fight on the
inside? uh in general I think the like
the political appointees do have the
lead so it&#39;s difficult to make those
changes but when you&#39;re um when you have
influence on even on a mid level like a
mid me as a press officer you can have
those discussions there were people that
like yeah were political appointees that
you could have a sit down discussion
with and be like hey this isn&#39;t right
and there were actually people that were
easier to talk to than others right you
knew who to talk to like it was it was a
bit of a a tight rope constantly of like
okay like even saying this with this
person might be might be flag with this
person I can have this discussion and it
was sometimes it was it could have been
effective and I think those small
changes I know people on the outside
might be like like why were you there or
whatever but those small changes do make
a difference cuz then someone says
something about um hey this airirst
strike was wrong or we have provided
condolences that leads to then
journalists being able to provide
accountability because they&#39;ll say hey
you said x then
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when if you go for full hardline then
that&#39;s your policy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so is that your assessment now with your
firing that&#39;s where you think things I
It&#39;s already kind of was the policy, but
you just think it&#39;ll be even more mad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Like if it is. So if if um if the
my replacement or whoever goes in front
of me, who knows? I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s
going to happen. I think um they they
realize that like it&#39;s going to be a
political point or what. I don&#39;t I&#39;m not
sure. But um uh no one&#39;s going to want
to push back after what happened to me.
And I wasn&#39;t someone who uh was like a
random press officer. Like I was pretty
well established. I was the guy not only
was I was doing the longest briefings. I
my my colleagues in the room I had to do
a full like 20-minute briefing with the
spokesperson whereas someone else might
be much shorter. Um I was also the
person who was
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on social level organizing the happy
hours with just internally or with
reporters. I was like in a in a position
of I felt very secure and I was close
with a lot of colleagues. Uh, and to go
from that and and firing me very
quickly, I think it sends uh like a
chilling effect um through the building
and an NEA of tow the line and now uh
what&#39;s the spokesperson going to do?
They&#39;re going to listen to the next
press officer or are they going to call
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the David Milsts of the world or him
specifically before he goes to the
podium to make sure he&#39;s covered?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. And do you think that was part of
the intent in firing you was to send
that chill? Oh, I do. Yeah. Send that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do 100%. Well, Chad, we appreciate you
joining us, man. It was a lot of
insight. I think the audience will find
it very insightful.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I certainly did. Thanks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you for having me. My
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pleasure.
