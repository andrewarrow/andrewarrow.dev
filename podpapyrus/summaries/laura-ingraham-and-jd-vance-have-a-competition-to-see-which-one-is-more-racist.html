Last night, Laura Ingram had JD Vance on
her show for an interview. And this
answer here from him to one of her
questions uh about trying to force
the states and cities to comply with the
federal government. I think kind of
encapsulates really the the overarching
theme of this administration or one of
the the many ones. Um for people that
don&#39;t know,
the federal government does have control
over, you know, immigration law. That is
in their purview. But there&#39;s this thing
called the 10th amendment which says
that states and local governments do not
have to be forced. They cannot be
compelled to enforce laws by the federal
government. They can&#39;t actively thwart
them, which is I think what they&#39;re
trying to argue in the administration.
But this has been a precedent that has
been reified and reasserted multiple
times, including by one Antinine Scalia
in the case in 1997, Prince v. United
States. The quote, which I uh read this
morning in a conservative publication,
said, &#34;The federal government may
neither issue directives requiring the
states to address particular problems
nor command the state&#39;s officers or
those of their political subdivisions to
administer or enforce a federal
regulatory program. So that is uh the
case with immigration law. Cities don&#39;t
have to be uh don&#39;t have to comply with
ICE. Um, and that is in the
Constitution. And yet that is what this
administration is obsessed with. So here
is Laura Ingram asking the vice
president about that dynamic
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; given the fact that they&#39;re endangering
the lives and killing American citizens
as we saw with that horrific crash in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Literally killing Americans.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Literally killing Americans. I mean the
these are these are not madeup
statistics. These can cause it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These are not madeup statistics. They
are referring to a truck driver who
was an immigrant from India who I guess
had was in Florida and he had a driver&#39;s
license, God forbid, and he made an
illegal U-turn and it killed three
This What do you mean these are not
madeup statistics? You&#39;re not citing a
statistic, Laura. You&#39;re citing an
anecdote about a car accident.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Like and you know people always
point out ad nauseium that immigrant
communities are typically uh like commit
less crimes and violations than do
citizens of this country. But because
they&#39;re immigrants, people like this
fascists demonize them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I mean, I was going to get to that
later, but now that you brought it up,
we can just read this briefly from NPR
last year. One some of the most
extensive research on this comes from
Stanford University. uh economist Ran
Abramitzi uh found that since the 1960s,
immigrants are 60% less likely to be
incarcerated than US-born people.
There&#39;s also state level research that
shows similar results. Researchers at
the Ko Institute, a libertarian think
libertarian think tank, looked into
Texas in 2019. They found that
undocumented immigrants were 37.1%
less likely to be convicted of a crime
beyond incarceration rates. Research
also shows that there is no correlation
between undocumented people and a rise
in crime. Recent investigations by the
New York Times and the Marshall Project
found that between 2007 and 2016, there
was no link between undocumented
immigrants and a rise in violent or
property crime in those communities.
It&#39;s also important to note that since
uh the spike in the two pandemic uh
years and also it it it crossed over
into 2023 but crime in general in the
country has been precipitously
declining. So there is no data that
backs up their racist claims even as
Laura Ingram comes up with an anecdote
that she says is data.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. And I mean to be fair to
libertarians like Chase Oliver, the
candidate that was on their ticket had
probably the best immigration platform
of anybody on the ticket. Um but you
know somebody like Dave Smith had to
package up libertarianism for Donald
Trump to win. But yeah, do we want to go
back to J?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, we&#39;ll start the question uh from
the beginning.
to get better policies that actually
serve the American people
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; given the fact that they&#39;re endangering
the lives and killing American citizens
as we saw with that horrific crash in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Literally killing Americans.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Literally killing Americans. I mean the
these are these are not made up
statistics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like how about say that about the gun
industry. Sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean federal highway funds that&#39;s
that&#39;s leverage that the federal
government has over the states that
refuse to do the basics. Would you
consider advising that DOT and the
administration pull back on federal
highway funds for these uh states?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I don&#39;t want to get ahead of any
administration announcements, but we are
looking at a whole host of points of
leverage we can exercise over California
and other states to make sure they
comply with the law. Uh sanctuary cities
are killing people because you allow
these violent criminals to set up shop
in your cities. Obviously, you saw this
case with a person who who murdered
people on the road, three people on the
road because he couldn&#39;t even read the
road signs. Uh we have a lot of points
of leverage here, but but fundamentally
I think the American people have to
stand with us here because when we go
and tell the the the governor of
California or the governor of New York
that you you have to stop putting the
interest of illegal aliens over American
citizens, we need the American people to
stand with us. And I think that they
will. I think that they are. But we&#39;re
definitely not going to let this slide.
Laura, you can&#39;t do it. You&#39;ve got to
stop putting the interests of foreigners
who don&#39;t have the right to be here over
the interests of American citizens. That
is the that is the entire point and
purpose of the Democratic party. If you
go back to the election of 2024, what
was the big issue? The big issue was
illegal immigration. They were actually
defending the rights of illegal
immigrants to come into our country to
vote in our elections to collect social
security and Medicaid that ought by
right go to American citizens to say
nothing of housing. This is actually the
biggest driver of housing costs in some
of these big blue cities is that they&#39;ve
flooded the zone with illegal
immigrants. As we&#39;ve kicked illegal
aliens out of our country, you actually
see housing costs start to level off.
So, fundamentally, the difference
between Republicans and Democrats is we
care about American citizens. They
actually don&#39;t like American citizens
and want to replace them with low-wage
foreigners. It&#39;s a very stark
difference, and I think the American
people are going to continue to reward
us because of it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. When pause it, all right, or
end it there. I just wanted to get to
that housing piece because of how
disgustingly cynical it is when I say
that that clip is indicative of what
this administration is about. That&#39;s
what I mean when he finally gets around
to the cost of living which Trump is uh
making much worse right now as we&#39;re
about to discuss with Liz Pancotti about
how school supplies are already
drastically increasing in price as
Trump&#39;s tariffs begin to make their
effects felt. um they have no answer for
the cost of living crisis except to
demonize other people. They don&#39;t want
to tax corporations,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; people who build housing,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to redistribute wealth to folks. They
don&#39;t want to uh crack down on corporate
landlords who are price fixing. They
have nothing to address the cost of
living crisis except to exacerbate it
with the tariffs. But when they&#39;re
addressed with when they have to address
something very real, oh, it&#39;s the
immigrants. for kicking them out to make
your life better. That&#39;s not happening
right now. It&#39;s actually getting a lot
worse. And the housing crisis is no
joke. Uh with the there was a Harvard
study in 2023 that found that over 22
million renters now spend over 30% of
their income on rent and utilities.
That&#39;s really the standard of like
what&#39;s supposed to be affordable is if
you spend 30%. That&#39;s half of all
renters who are spending more than is
supposed to be allowable for your budget
roughly and that&#39;s kind of considered
the affordability threshold. Half of all
renters right now are exceeding their
means just on housing and utilities. And
there was uh data where you can just
look at the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics showing that prices for uh
folks primary residences, they&#39;ve
tracked this, have increased since 2015
over a 10-year period by over 50%
outpacing inflation, which was around
So, it&#39;s out of control. And his answer
is, well, we&#39;ll kick out all the
immigrants. I mean, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re
going to see how this goes. Are rental
prices going to start to go down across
the country because of this? We know the
answer. And the it when he&#39;s threatening
also at the beginning of the clip
withholding federal highway funds from
California if they assert their
constitutional right to not comply with
the federal government under the 10th
amendment. I mean pointing out their
hypocrisy is
yields nothing at this point. But god,
the states right stuff. It&#39;s just so
obvious how cynical and how quickly they
abandoned that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, those those precedents
need to be used next time the Democrats
have power. But like first of all, the
setup shop for foreigners to do criminal
murders uh is such a lie. Uh sanctuary
laws are passed often with the uh
support of police departments because it
allows communities to say report violent
folks um and other problems to
authorities without worrying about ICE
coming and kicking them down the door
and sending them to you know some
country. Um and they it&#39;s already the
case that if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s a
violent criminal that local authorities
aren&#39;t going to what? Let them set up
shop. No, they go in and arrest them.
That&#39;s what they&#39;ve been doing this
entire time. But the housing crisis
caused by some sort of like Biden era
immigration influx. No, we&#39;ve been we
haven&#39;t been building houses since 2008.
This is very clear pattern. Um that post
the 2008 financial crisis, America has
stopped building houses at the rate that
it had for decades and decades and
decades since then. And now it and you
know what who builds those houses is a
lot of times immigrants. Um, and who
should just be if you uh build houses in
this country for a American developers
that should you should just give get
citizenship and full labor protections.
Um, that&#39;s the way to deal with that.
Uh, but it&#39;s not to kick people out who
are actually going to be doing all the
hard work and like JD Vance who&#39;s been a
gopher for venture capitalist for his
entire adult life.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And he also um was making claims
that they&#39;re stealing our social
services. This is another insanely false
claim that they rely on. It&#39;s incredible
how many lives are just in that one
clip. Like I honestly
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they&#39;re going to let him vote. It&#39;s like
no, we should let them seek asylum,
which by the way Biden didn&#39;t even do.
He revoked Title 42.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If if you&#39;re an immigrant and you are
say on a green card or you&#39;re working
and you have a W2, you are paying into
our social security and Medicare system
and there&#39;s no guarantee if you don&#39;t
get citizenship that you&#39;re going to get
any of it. They are subsidizing our
social services, not stealing from it.
They are also taking jobs JD Vance that
are often subminimum wage exploitative
that Americans have more protections
because of citizenship that they uh
aren&#39;t often compelled to do in the same
way that like migrant children are when
we get stories about them dying in
meatacking processing uh plants and and
and that kind of thing. So, um, it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Donald Trump is literally the c a type
of capitalist who uses undocumented
immigrant labor to, uh, make bigger
profits. He did it with Trump Tower. He
used undocumented Polish workers, uh,
who threatened to kill, uh, the guy who
Trump had hired them because he started
to stiffen them on payments. Like, that
that is literally the guy. He&#39;s the guy.
It&#39;s not We don&#39;t even have to be
theoretical like, oh, capitalists like
ICE because it does the work for them.
Because what happened when they
threatened Trump&#39;s foreman is uh Trump
threatened, it wasn&#39;t ICE at that time,
it was uh whatever the deport other
border uh services was. But it was Yeah.
Get them in here. Get them out because
they&#39;re not being compliant laborers.
Trump is the guy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And I I I headline this, but this
was the vacation wars are kind of a
silly partisan fight that happens every
administration, but it is a little
jarring that JD Vance has taken more
vacations than there have been months
that he&#39;s been in power. Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; where&#39;s he going?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, it&#39;s like Iceland. I there all
across the world. I mean, what&#39; you say?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Didn&#39;t he go to the Vatican?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Oh, right. And then he killed the
Pope allegedly. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; he&#39;s on missions.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clock.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So I I just like he was
notoriously lazy as a senator and in his
Senate run. He&#39;s just the kind of guy
that wants to sit on his ass with a big
pile of money.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hollywood JD.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is what gives me a little bit hope
of hope with if he&#39;s the standard bearer
for MAGA going forward. Like I don&#39;t
know if he has the juice and I don&#39;t
think he has the work ethic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they should all go on vacation for the
next three years. Oh, I&#39;m I I I hope
those golf numbers for Donald Trump are
just like through the roof here. Um,
