It&#39;s not looking too good for Donald and
the attempt by the White House to show
us signs of proof of life continue to
backfire. At this point, they&#39;re going
to show us photos of Donald Trump from
the 1980s and say, &#34;See everybody,
here&#39;s the official photo from the White
House of Donald Trump heading to play
golf this morning.&#34; Or they&#39;re going to
like show us photos of Bigfoot and say,
&#34;You see him right there? There he is in
the woods. He&#39;s perfectly fine.&#34; I mean,
that&#39;s not too different from what we&#39;re
seeing this morning on Labor Day. I
mean, there&#39;s no press appearances
scheduled for Donald Trump on Labor Day,
which is very odd. He hasn&#39;t been in
front of the press since last Wednesday,
which is very odd. They&#39;ve been posting
all of these images of him from last
week or weeks ago, and they&#39;ve been
trying to pretend that this is him today
or yesterday. He&#39;s been doing the same.
He&#39;s like, &#34;Look, I played golf with
John Gruden on Sunday. I was perfectly
healthy. Good night, everybody. I feel
great.&#34; We&#39;re like, &#34;You played golf
with him on August 23rd. Like, we have
the receipts. That was not yesterday.&#34;
And you&#39;re just causing more suspicion
uh to arise. This is what they&#39;re saying
is his photo today on Labor Day. Look at
him right there. Even if that is the
photo, I mean, he&#39;s deeply unwell.
Here&#39;s the Bigfoot shot of him. not
actually Bigfoot, but they&#39;re they&#39;re
claiming this is him right there on the
golf cart right there. I don&#39;t know if
that&#39;s a nurse behind him or what&#39;s
going on there. Or this is a photo that
a right-wing radio host um posted. And
if you look in the mirror right there,
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s uh a caretaker or
secret service or what&#39;s going on there.
Um, Donald Trump did post good night
last night at 1000 p.m. to which
California Governor Gavin Newsome
responded, &#34;Night night, grandpa.&#34; And
California Governor Gavin Newsome
continues to troll Donald Trump
mercilessly. Which we love here at the
Midas Touch Network. Donald Trump has
been posting on his official account, or
I should say people have been posting
for him on his official social media
accounts, his Instagram account. Um,
they posted this image, $8 trillion in
tariff revenue and hundreds of thousands
of new jobs created. Happy Labor Day.
All false. $8 trillion in tariff revenue
has not been achieved. Even if it were
to be achieved, that means it was an
eight trillion dollar tax on ourselves
because tariffs are taxes on the
importers in the United States that are
passed on to consumers. It&#39;s not a
controversial topic. As Jessica Ryell
writes, &#34;Today alone, the White House
has claimed $8 trillion in new tariff
revenue, $4 trillion in net deficit
reduction, $5 trillion in new business
investment, hundreds of thousands of
jobs from these investments, record low
gas prices.
Each claim is 100% made up. Let me show
you uh Maryland&#39;s mayor, Wes Moore, uh
getting in some trolling of Donald
Trump. I I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s
intentional trolling or just showing
that he&#39;s in good shape compared to
compared to Donald Trump. Here&#39;s
Maryland Governor Wesmore running with
the trooper candidates before their uh
graduation on Labor Day or right before
Labor Day. Here, play this clip right
Oh, lot.
Let&#39;s ride.
We love each other.
Now folks, while Donald Trump is in this
decrepit, deteriorating,
cognitively adultled, physically rotting
state, at least in my opinion, that&#39;s
what he&#39;s in right now. You you you&#39;re
free to share your own opinions. Um he&#39;s
destroying America&#39;s economy. He&#39;s
destroying America&#39;s foreign policy. So
uh today, yesterday and today uh Xi
Jinping of China is holding a Shanghai
cooperation
uh meeting. Uh Prime Minister Modi of
India is there. Vladimir Putin is there
and there are dozens of other countries
uh that are there as well being
represented by their top leaders. This
is Xi Jingping of China asserting that
China is the leader of the world right
now as America is incredibly weak and
decrepit under a failed and rotting
president in in Donald Trump and Prime
Minister Modi of India who hadn&#39;t taken
a trip to China in 7 years was there
laughing it up with Vladimir Putin and
Xi Jinping. They were all laughing. They
were mocking Don likely mocking the
weakness of the United States under
Donald Trump. Mocking all of Donald
Trump&#39;s lies. Like you can lit They&#39;re
sending a message right here with this
video that they put out that America
actually is being laughed at by the
world. As Donald Trump said, the world
laughs at us. They weren&#39;t laughing at
us before. The world respected the
United States of America. People have
laughed at you your entire life, Donald,
because you are a vile piece of trash.
You are a pathetic loser. You are
probably one of the most, if not the
most trash human being perhaps ever in
existence. So people laugh at you and
they laugh at your cult followers who
believe your stupid crap like LA would
have been totally destroyed, but Donald
Trump saved it. Anyway, here&#39;s the video
in uh China of Prime Minister Modi
basically saying how how how adult and
crazy is Donald Trump and Putin and Xi
Jinping are laughing. Watch this.
And just so you have a little flavor of
what took place right here, here&#39;s how
Bloomberg politics describes what went
down. Let&#39;s talk about it. Prime
Minister Narendra Modi announced
resumption of direct flights between
India and China in his meeting with
Xiinping at the port city of Tanzhin
indicating that both countries want to
restart a working relationship.
The meeting comes in the backdrop of
souring India US relationship with
President Trump slapping 50% tariffs the
highest in Asia on India and blaming New
Delhi for funding Putin&#39;s war.
All these have fueled speculation that
India is pivoting back to China and
Russia away from the US. China and India
have both taken steps to normalize and
stabilize the relationship. Although
difficult issues still remain, what can
be said with certinity is that both
countries are trying to work together
and President Trump is an incentive.
All right. Well, now you have um again
as as Trump posts images like this
today, Trump&#39;s economy is booming,
consumer spending up. False. Inflation
low. False. Wages up. False. Just false.
Just every like very false. Very very
false. Okay. Uh, our economy appears to
be heading into, if it&#39;s not already, in
stagflation.
Decreasing GDP, increasing unemployment,
increasing inflation. That&#39;s bad. That&#39;s
bad. Like 1970s, bad. But, you know, you
wanted to make America go back into
time. So, you wanted to go back when
America&#39;s main source of revenue was
tariff revenue uh in the late uh what in
the late 19th century, early 20th
century. That&#39;s when you said America
was its most powerful when we
legitimately were not the richest and
most powerful. That&#39;s what you want to
bring us back to. horse and buggies and
coal and and uh and child labor and uh
measles and and pandemics. Fantastic.
Donald Trump makes another post
attacking India. What few people
understand is that we do very little
business with India. All right. If you
think we do very little business with
India, then shut up. That that&#39;s your
justification now. We do very little
business with India. So, they&#39;re being
mean to me, but we do very little
business with them. California Governor
Newsome mocking Donald Trump posts the
following. Happy Labor Day to all,
including the scum that is trying to
destroy our country with a sick, warped,
radical mind. Killing small businesses
with crazy tariffs, taking health care
from children, pardoning J6 thugs,
sending the private army to arrest
grandma, wrecking our beautiful
environment, defunding our schools, and
destabilizing long-standing
international relationships. Hopefully,
the United States Supreme Court and
other good and compassionate judges
throughout the land will save us from
the decisions of the monsters who want
our country to go to hell. But fear not,
we have made great progress in recent
weeks and America will soon be safe and
great again. Again, happy Labor Day and
God bless America. GCN.
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t
point out this story about Rudy
Giuliani, who was apparently in a bad
car accident. This was the official
statement by Rudy Giuliani&#39;s office or
press team or head of security. A very
weird story right here. I&#39;ll just read
to you what they claim happened. On the
evening of August 30th, 2025 in New
Hampshire, Mayor Giuliani was involved
in a motorcycle accident. Prior to the
incident, he was flagged down by a woman
who was the victim of a domestic
violence incident. Mayor Giuliani
immediately rendered assistance and then
contacted 911. He remained on scene
until responding officers arrived to
ensure her safety. Following this, while
traveling on the highway, Mayor
Giuliani&#39;s vehicle was struck from
behind at high speed. He was transported
to a nearby trauma center where he was
diagnosed with a fractured thoratic
vertebrae, multiple lacerations, and
contusions, as well as injuries to his
left arm and lower leg. His business
partner and medical provider were
promptly contacted and arrived at the
hospital to oversee his care. At this
time, no further updates are available.
This is the only statement authorized by
Mayor Giuliani, signed Michael Reggus,
head of Mayor Giuliani&#39;s security.
Yeah, you you saved a domestic violence
incident in New Hampshire and then you
drove away and then it&#39;s just a strange
way to message it. Very strange way to
message an incident. I mean, I don&#39;t
know what happened, but it&#39;s a odd
framing of a situation.
