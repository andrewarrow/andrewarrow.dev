people make spirituality extremely
complicated.
That&#39;s because they make all of life
very complicated.
For example, this is how simple life is.
You were born.
You dropped down on this planet.
that&#39;s spinning around the middle of
absolute dark empty space. I tell you
all the time,
1.3 million Earths fit inside the sun.
That&#39;s a very big number. That means the
Earth is extremely small. You don&#39;t pay
any attention to the rest.
We&#39;ll talk about that. That&#39;s what makes
it complicated because it&#39;s really
simple. There&#39;s this tiny little planet
spinning around a star and there&#39;s 300
billion of those stars in your galaxy.
300 billion suns and 1.3 billion earths
fit inside the sun and you are fixated
on what&#39;s going on on that planet and
you wouldn&#39;t even stay here very long.
Planet&#39;s been here for 4.5 billion
Here, 80, 90 years on a tiny little
planet in the middle of nowhere. And I
stop by telling you there&#39;s 300 billion
stars in your galaxy. There&#39;s two
trillion galaxies. How often do you pay
attention to the rest? None ever. That&#39;s
why your life is so complicated.
Otherwise, it&#39;s very, very simple.
You&#39;re sitting on a planet for a few
years. It&#39;s spinning around a star and
every day it rotates on its axis. There,
that&#39;s your life. Everything else is you
making a mess. Otherwise, have fun.
You&#39;re on a planet. There&#39;s things to
do. Doesn&#39;t matter what they are.
They&#39;re just things going on. How
meaningful is the planet? You think
what&#39;s in front of you is meaningful?
Forget what&#39;s in front of you. The
entire planet, anything going on, what&#39;s
so meaningful? If it blew up to
smitherreens tomorrow, total gone. A few
planets would change their orbit.
Nothing else in the universe would even
know you were here.
I just want your mind to do that. I&#39;m
sorry, I&#39;m repetitive. Okay, so you have
a star. You spin around the star. That
star is 93 million miles away. Miamiy&#39;s
That&#39;s a big distance away. That&#39;s how
far you are from that star. Where&#39;s the
next star?
Where&#39;s the next star? Let make sure I
keep my numbers right. I believe it is
light years away.
The next star. Well, that number doesn&#39;t
mean anything to you. What&#39;s a
lightyear? If I take a photon, a light
beam, hold it above the Earth in my
fingers. I got it. I got it. Let it go
for one second. It circumnavigated the
globe seven and a half times. That fast
enough for you? That&#39;s one second. Go
that speed every second, every minute,
every hour, every day, every year for
4.2 years, and you will get to the next
Are you embarrassed? Don&#39;t think about
these things. It&#39;s ridiculous. What&#39;s
going on? Why would you make such a mess
of your life when it&#39;s so big? There&#39;s
lots of room. That&#39;s the next star and
there&#39;s 300 billion year galaxy and
they&#39;re pretty much all that far away
from each other. It&#39;s called reality.
Life is simple. That&#39;s life. You drop
down and it&#39;s nothing. You&#39;re conscious.
Thanks God. Have a good time. Have a
dance on the planet for a few years. But
you can&#39;t because you make it
complicated.
It isn&#39;t even complicated to explain why
you make it complicated or how you make
it complicated. You don&#39;t need
psychology books and all this and
philosophy. No, it&#39;s very, very simple.
How did you miss the fact that you fell
down on a planet, you spin around for a
few years, and you go back somewhere or
not? Who cares?
You&#39;ll find out. People get the whole
thing going about death. They make that
complicated. Death is a once in
a-lifetime experience. And you&#39;re gonna
find out whether you&#39;re there after you
die. And if you&#39;re not there, don&#39;t
worry about it. It&#39;s not like you s say,
&#34;Oh god, I&#39;m not here.&#34; No, you&#39;re not
See how simple it is? This is what it
means to leave things simple. How did
you get them so complicated that you
can&#39;t wake up in the morning and say,
&#34;I&#39;m back. I wonder what&#39;s going to
happen today.&#34; And not care. Just have
fun with it. It&#39;s an exciting place.
There&#39;s always something going on, is
there not? How did you make this so
complicated? Where&#39;s the suffering?
Where&#39;s the anxiety? Where&#39;s the worry?
There&#39;s none of that.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. So
what? Let&#39;s have fun with what happens.
I can&#39;t. There you go. Why not? Because
I have decided what I want to happen.
So you dropped down on this planet in
the middle of nowhere. It shows you how
big it is. And you&#39;re here for a few
years. It&#39;s been here for 4.5 billion.
and you decide what&#39;s supposed to
happen. Have you noticed it doesn&#39;t
happen the way you want it to? Why
should it? Why should it happen the way
you want it to? It happens the way it
happens. That&#39;s very zen. Flowers are
red, water&#39;s blue, grass is green. Now
go home.
Things are what they are. Have you
noticed it rains when it rains? It&#39;s hot
when it&#39;s hot. People are nice when
they&#39;re nice. They&#39;re mean when they&#39;re
mean. Your body looks one way when
you&#39;re young. looks another way when
you&#39;re old. Things are what they are.
Why? Because that&#39;s how they are. Why
don&#39;t you ask why the planet&#39;s so small
at 1.3 million inside the sun or why the
closest star away is 4.2 light years.
But why? Why? Do you see what I&#39;m
saying? It&#39;s like this stuff is real.
But the problem is you came down here
and instead of just have a good time.
It&#39;s a fun place. There&#39;s things
happening all over the place all the
time, is there not? When was the last
time nothing was happening? Never. You
given a body that can experience it.
Hey, where&#39;d you get your body? A single
cell. You live in a place that a single
cell, one cell made your body. Pretty
miraculous place you live in. But you&#39;re
you&#39;re suffering. Why? 35 trillion
living cells make up your body every
day. Liver, pancreas, this, that, pineal
gland, everything. Do you say thank you?
No. You&#39;re too busy in your head having
to decide what you want to happen and
what you don&#39;t want to happen and then
worry about how to make it happen and
worry about what you want to might
happen. Okay, there&#39;s your problem.
Buddha said all life is suffering. First
noble truth. What&#39;s the second noble
truth? The cause of all suffering is
preference, desire. The fact that you
made up what you want means you&#39;re going
to suffer. Have you noticed? So it&#39;s
simple. Life is simple. You drop down on
the planet, you say thank you. You say
thank your parents if you want, but kind
of say thank you to reality that made
your body and keeps it like you care
about what it tastes when you feed your
food, what the food tastes like. Oh,
thank you for cooking such nice sp when
you swallow that food. What happens?
Then the chemicals break down and it
gets distributed through a thing to feed
all the Whoa. Why say thank you to that?
It&#39;s a little more important, isn&#39;t it?
This is how messed up we are. This is
how we made life impossible to enjoy,
impossible to live, impossible to not
suffer. Why do you have tension? People
have tension, tension and anxiety. Why?
Because the mind has decided how it
needs things to be to be okay. And it&#39;s
decided how they better not be or you
won&#39;t be okay. And you don&#39;t have
control of the world. I try to get this
across. I know I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t
understand. There&#39;s a moment unfolding
in front of you. See, there it is. How
many moments are going on on the planet
Earth at the same time that moment&#39;s
unfolding in front of you? 700 billion
zillion quillion. Do you care about
those? No. That&#39;s pretty selective. It&#39;s
just a moment in reality. No, it&#39;s it&#39;s
my moment. Okay, I&#39;m going to pick you
up and I&#39;ll drop you over there in
France. Now, that&#39;s your moment. What
happened to the one I took up from? I
don&#39;t care. Why would you do that? The
moments are all tied together. It&#39;s a
system. Everything&#39;s influenced
everything else. The moment in front of
you has history. Why it is the way it
is. Every moment everywhere has history.
You don&#39;t care, do you? I&#39;m picking on
you, but it&#39;s the truth. All you care
about is your mind has decided what you
want and what you don&#39;t want. And all
you care about is the moment in front of
you. How&#39;s it doing? Matching your want
or not want. And you&#39;re struggling. You
have anxiety. And see, understand why
it&#39;s so complicated. You made it
complicated. It&#39;s not complicated. Life
is not complicated. It just is what it
is and you can enjoy it. But what if
things happen that I don&#39;t like?
Maybe instead of checking the things
that are happening you don&#39;t like, you
need to check why you don&#39;t like
reality. Do you like reality? An
enlightened being loves reality. A
normal human being, but you don&#39;t want
to be a normal human being. A normal
human being does not like reality. They
like what they&#39;ve decided to like. And
if the world matches what they decided,
they like that. So, you limited your
life to the moments that happen to
unfold the way you decided you wanted
them to. Well, they don&#39;t. Most of them
don&#39;t do that. Like 99.9% of them don&#39;t.
Then you kill yourself to try and make
them do that. And it creates anxiety and
alters and tension and so on. So, if you
stop doing that, stop doing what? Stop
making up the way you think it&#39;s
supposed to be. What&#39;s wrong with
enjoying and appreciating and respecting
reality here? It&#39;s been here for 4.5
billion years. It&#39;s got some history on
you. And things are the way they are
because of this law. Cause and effect.
Every single thing in front of you is a
result of cause and effect. Is it not?
Why is that person yelling at me? You
don&#39;t want to know cuz it&#39;ll take you
your whole life to figure it out. What
did his mother do? What his father do?
What happened yesterday? What food did
he eat? What indigestion does he have?
All of those forces are why this
person&#39;s being the way they are. But
psychologist say man is the sum of his
learned experiences. Well, that&#39;s a lot
of experiences you didn&#39;t know anything
about. Even your husband or wife, you
don&#39;t know nothing. They all had
different experiences. Can somebody be a
given way in the morning and have an
experience at work and then come home
and be different? Because of the summon
learn experience called cause and
effect. So that&#39;s what&#39;s in front of
you. What&#39;s in front of you at any given
moment is the result of every single
thing that ever happened and made it be
that way including you.
Why do you like some things and not
others? Ever check that out? Why do you
want something one way and somebody else
another? Where did your preferences come
from? But a normal human being, they
don&#39;t think about that. It&#39;s me. It&#39;s
not you. It&#39;s some of your learned
experiences. Every single preference you
have, every desire you have is because
of past experiences you&#39;ve had that
programmed your mind that way.
So life is simple if you don&#39;t decide
how it&#39;s supposed to be. It is what it
is. It rains when it rains. What&#39;s wrong
with that? It&#39;s hot when it&#39;s hot.
What&#39;s wrong with that? She&#39;s nice when
she&#39;s nice. She&#39;s mean when she&#39;s mean.
It&#39;s so easy if you stop doing this.
That&#39;s what Buddha said. That the cause
of all suffering is desire. What is a
desire? A preference. It&#39;s that you have
a way you want it to be. That&#39;s what
causes your suffering. What if you went
to have your hair done and they cut it a
little bit too short? Okay, it&#39;s kind of
looks interesting. Not what I expected,
but it&#39;s cute. No, you freak out. I&#39;m
paying you. I&#39;ll sue you. You know when
you get old, your hair falls out. What&#39;s
wrong with that? And it turns white. So
what? Do I have to wear a hair cream?
Because I don&#39;t want it to go. Why? Why?
What&#39;s wrong with getting old? It&#39;s very
Every single moment of your life is
different. The older you get, the better
life is. It&#39;s like wine.
Why? When you get old enough, you don&#39;t
have to care what people think about
you. If you burp, anything you do, you
know, just a He&#39;s old. What do you
expect? He&#39;s old, right? It&#39;s really
neat. I like it a lot.
What do you care what people think about
you? It&#39;s not fun, is it? It&#39;s not fun
caring what everybody thinks about you.
How often you have a conversation, you
finish the conversation, but it&#39;s not
over in your head. Oh, I shouldn&#39;t have
said that. Oh god, I forgot to tell
that. Was so impress. Ain&#39;t that fun
being erotic?
You can&#39;t even have a conversation with
somebody without the mind doing that.
What if you go into a meeting and
someone going to ask you a question? Oh,
you drive so crazy. Look, let me get
something straight. You either know the
answer or you don&#39;t. Very simple. Well,
what if I know the answer? Then tell the
answer. Well, what if I don&#39;t know the
answer? Then say you don&#39;t know the
answer. No. No. It&#39;s rough living in
there, isn&#39;t it? It doesn&#39;t have to be.
It doesn&#39;t matter. Why does it matter
whether people like you or not? I&#39;ll
tell you why. Because you&#39;re not okay
inside. The only reason you care whether
people like you or not is because you&#39;re
not okay. And if they like you, you feel
better. If they don&#39;t like you, you feel
worse. Otherwise, who cares? Okay. Why
are you not okay inside? It&#39;s always the
same reason because you decided how
things need to be for you to be okay.
And you have to struggle to make them be
that way. And so if somebody likes you,
you feel better. And so you constantly
need this positive reinforcement to try
to make you feel better because you
don&#39;t feel good. Why don&#39;t you feel
good? Because you decided how everything
needs to be for you to be okay. And it&#39;s
not that way. So if you get to the
point, that&#39;s true spirituality, where
you decide, I&#39;m not going to work on
making everything be the way I want. I&#39;m
going to stop letting go of what I want.
But then I&#39;ll never be happy. That&#39;s
what we&#39;re going to talk about. If you
were to reach a state, true, not
suppression, not denial, where literally
you let go of all these stupid
preferences, then a range, you&#39;re
excited, it&#39;s raining, it&#39;s hot, oh my
god, there&#39;s that star 93 million miles
away. Oh, I just have fun with all of
it. Then it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t
matter what happens. It doesn&#39;t matter
if somebody likes you. Doesn&#39;t matter if
you have the corner office or you&#39;re in
the basement. It&#39;s fun. If you don&#39;t say
it&#39;s not fun, it&#39;s fun. One person owns
one kind of dog, another person another
kind of dog. You look, I could ever like
that kind of dog. He does. Why can&#39;t
you? Why are you doing this? So, you set
aside what you like against what you
dislike. And when you do that, you
suffer. So, I said life is actually
very, very simple. It&#39;s very simple.
You&#39;re dropped onto a planet for a few
years, have a good time,
and you&#39;re going to say to me, I can&#39;t.
And what you mean is I can only have a
good time if things are the way I want.
You should blush if I say that to you
because that&#39;s ridiculous. Who said you
can only have a good time if things are
the way you want? I did. Who decided
what you want? Me. Some people say to
me, I teach no preferences. I don&#39;t. You
can have preferences.
You can have preferences. Just prefer
everything.
That&#39;s called nonduality. Don&#39;t
differentiate.
She&#39;s tall. She&#39;s short. She&#39;s young.
She&#39;s old. She&#39;s Jewish. She&#39;s Catholic.
Wow, that&#39;s exciting. I want to get to
know her. Why can&#39;t you enjoy things?
Because you said you don&#39;t. Your mind
decided what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not. And
now you&#39;re only okay if it matches your
mind. And it doesn&#39;t. Why would life
match your mind? The causes, historical
causes that came together to create the
moment in front of you has nothing to do
with what&#39;s going on in your mind. It&#39;s
not true that God doesn&#39;t like you.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s raining on your
birthday. It doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s your
birthday. But you say that I&#39;m not
happy. Why? I one day, one day it didn&#39;t
have to rain. You do talk like that.
You&#39;re making a mess of your life by
deciding how it&#39;s supposed to be instead
of enjoying the way it is. All right.
So, that&#39;s how life can be simple. Stop
it. Stop using your mind to mess
yourself up and then trying to use the
messed up mind to decide how to be okay.
Okay. Like a car drives by. God, I wish
I had one like that. Okay, you get to
say that&#39;s okay. Another car drives by.
That one&#39;s neat, too. But no, one drove
by. I wish I had one like that. Now you
got to get a nighttime job. Can&#39;t be
with your family. You got up tight
because you didn&#39;t get the raise and
somebody else did just because you
decided it had to be the way you wanted.
Can you imagine for a moment not doing
that and just enjoying life?
Just enjoying life. It&#39;s not your life.
It&#39;s going on all over the place. You
just enjoy it. Enjoy it. I&#39;m going to
pick you up and drop you down into a
restaurant in France. You never been
there. Drop down. What&#39;s it going to be
like in your mind? I know what some
people&#39;s mind would say. My god, they
don&#39;t even speak English. What&#39;s the
matter with them?
Wow. Somebody else mine could say, &#34;Wow,
look, I don&#39;t even understand anything.
This is this is I want to know how to
order water. This is so much fun. Which
do you want? Which way you want to be?
You want to be happy or you want to
fight to make yourself happy?&#34; I&#39;m going
to repeat that to you. Do you want to be
happy or do you want to have to fight
for things to be the way you want so you
can be happy? You know, I never said
those exact words before. What&#39;s the
difference between being happy and
having to fight to make things be the
way you want so you can be happy? You
had nothing to do with the outside. It
had to do with you deciding which way
you want to live your life. Make one up
based on your past experiences and then
try to make the one you&#39;re happy be the
way you want in order to be happy or
just stop that. The great way Thursday
patriarch the great way is not difficult
for those have no preferences. That was
one of the deepest spiritual writings
ever written. Very simple. All you need
is one line. The great way enlightenment
is not difficult for those who have no
preferences. Or the way I&#39;ve changed it,
the great way is not difficult for those
who prefer everything. Same. So, do you
want to be happy or do you want to
struggle with life to make it be the way
that you feel happy? Not working so
good, is it? Who made that decision? you
did. Those are the two different ways to
live your life. A worldly life, which is
not a negative term. It doesn&#39;t mean
money or something like that. A worldly
life means the world needs to be a
certain way for me to be okay. A
spiritual life means God is neat. The
very fact that there is a planet
spinning in the middle of nowhere&#39;s I
mean literally I showed you what
nowhere&#39;s look like. That&#39;s pretty big
nowhere. If the closest star is, you
know, 4.2 two light years away and
there&#39;s 300 billion of them and there&#39;s
two trillion guy that&#39;s this is the
middle of nowhere and there&#39;s all this
stuff going on there&#39;s computers there&#39;s
men and women there&#39;s people there&#39;s
words right and you got to land on this
planet I&#39;m going to put you on Mars
you&#39;re going to be so bored there&#39;s
nothing happening on Mars Jupiter you&#39;ll
fall right through it&#39;s gas there&#39;s no
place we have seen with the web or the
Hubble or probes that you would want to
go other than saying I went there, but
you want to come right back. There&#39;s
nothing going on anywhere else. Nothing.
Nothing. And look what&#39;s going on here.
There&#39;s trees and elephants and birds
and roaches and there&#39;s everything. And
instead of being blown away every second
of your life that you landed here for a
few years, you all you do is complain.
Do people complain
all the time about what? Pretty much
everything. Why? because they decided
how they need it to be to be okay.
Spirituality says stop it. Work with
your mind. Work with your mind to where
it doesn&#39;t do that. You can reach a
state where your mind doesn&#39;t do that.
Your mind says, &#34;Wow, look, there&#39;s rain
clouds. It&#39;s going to rain. Oh boy.&#34; The
mind looks says, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s a guy
hates my cousin. He&#39;s raining.&#34; Why
would your mind do that? It&#39;s called
positive thinking. And there&#39;s a natural
way to get there. And I&#39;m going to tell
it to you. It&#39;s not something you have
to force. Your mind is capable of being
your best friend working with you. The
only mind that matters is the
intellectual analytical mind. The
computer that remembers bad things that
happen and spew them up into your face
and throws them all. I don&#39;t need that
computer. It&#39;s like that&#39;s what your
mind is doing. It&#39;s storing what you
didn&#39;t like and throwing it back in your
face all the time. It doesn&#39;t need to do
that. There&#39;s a healthy mind. The
healthy mind is really good with
inventing and creating. Imagine how
beautiful that mind is. Being inspired
by everything and writing music and
doing this and coming up with solutions
and creating air conditioning and what a
brilliant mind and you all you use it
for is to complain. That&#39;s the problem.
Instead of enjoying your mind and
enjoying creating and enjoying all this
kind of stuff, you are not okay. So you
need to get something from things. Okay?
You&#39;re a beautiful being. You&#39;re capable
of enjoying every moment of your life.
Let go of this concept of want and not
want. But there are wars. Yes, there are
wars. There have always been wars.
That&#39;s one of the thing goes on. I&#39;ll
explain to you shortly why there are
wars. But in the meantime, there are
wars. Do I have to like wars? You have
to enjoy that you&#39;re here. And maybe you
can do something to help. Maybe you can
be nice to your neighbor so you&#39;re not
waring with them. But you don&#39;t have to
sit there and say, &#34;I can&#39;t be happy
because there are wars.&#34; Now there&#39;s
just another person not happy. There&#39;s
more suffering. Doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t
interact with things. Doesn&#39;t mean you
don&#39;t be activist. It doesn&#39;t mean
anything like that. But don&#39;t sit there
and suffer because things are not the
way you want. What did that do? It
didn&#39;t prove anything. So you just get
to the point where you realize it&#39;s not
about getting things the way you want.
It&#39;s about stop deciding what you want
things to be because they&#39;re not going
to be that way. And then then you
complain. All right. So life is simple
and it can be simple. How? Stop setting
aside what you like from what you
dislike. Learn to enjoy and appreciate
and respect the reality of life
unfolding in front of you and
everywhere. The fact that it&#39;s going on
everywhere is amazing. It&#39;s just
amazing. Every single person, eight, how
many people? 8.3 billion people on
planet Earth, they started off as a
single cell.
At least their body did. So that&#39;s what
you&#39;re talking to when you talk to
somebody. A single cell that knew how to
make that thing that you&#39;re talking to.
Wow. Not far out. If you say you were
standing there and all of a sudden a
little piece of dirt and grew up before
your very eyes and started cussing at
you. You tell every thing started
cussing at me. It&#39;s unbelievable, right?
Use your mind for something
constructive. Reality. Everything I&#39;ve
said so far is reality, isn&#39;t it? But
you ignore it. You only care with this
tiny little thing called your
preferences that you made up based on
your past experience. Is it not true
that you had different experience? You
have different preferences. Somebody was
mean to you in high school. What he
looks like, what his name was, what he
said, how he acted, what he drove, if
you see the car, if you see this, even
10 years later, you close.
It bothers you. You did that. No, he was
mean. Yeah, but he&#39;s not there anymore.
You literally took the time to store
inside of you every single thing that
ever bothered you. And then you wonder
why you&#39;re bothered. Did you not store
everything that ever bothered you inside
of you? So suppression. Troy talked
about it. Things happened. They bothered
you. What&#39; you do? Let them go. You did
not. You pushed them away and kept them
inside because you didn&#39;t want to feel
them. Then that&#39;s what&#39;s in there. If
you store everything that ever disturbed
you inside of you, what&#39;s it going to be
like in there? Disturbed. Are you
scared? Are you insecure? Are you tense?
Do you worry?
Of course you do.
Of course you do. Do you worry that
things that happened before that
bothered you might happen again? Of
course you do, cuz you stored it in
there. Even your parents got divorced
when you were five. That&#39;s still in
there. You didn&#39;t like your stepdad.
Now, anyone has his name. Anyone talks
about divorce. No, no, I don&#39;t get
married. We can live together. I&#39;m not
getting married. Why? I don&#39;t talk about
it. Why?
I don&#39;t want to get divorced. My parents
got divorced. I suffered. I&#39;m not going
to do that to a child. And I may even
have children because this world&#39;s tough
place. Why would I bring children into
this world? Tell me people don&#39;t talk
like that. You stored this garbage
inside of you and now it&#39;s running your
life and you wonder why it&#39;s so
difficult. Would it be difficult if you
decided you wanted everything to be? I
want the weather tomorrow to be such and
such. Temperature between this, this and
the other thing. Otherwise, I&#39;m going to
be very unhappy tomorrow. And that was
not an exaggeration, by the way. People
do that. What&#39;s the probability you&#39;ll
be happy? That&#39;s one way of living. And
it&#39;s not very much fun. And you made it
very complicated because now you have to
fight with everything and everybody to
get it the way you want. There your
whole life&#39;s fighting. It&#39;s a struggle.
Okay. The alternative I told you is to
not do that. To not do that. To sit
there and say, &#34;I&#39;m here. I&#39;ll be here
just for a few years. I can handle this.
going to camp or I am. And people are
different and people go through things.
Sometimes people do things that make a
heart hurt. What&#39;s wrong with that? Glad
I have a heart. Okay, fine. It hurts. It
hurts. And sometimes it feels good. Just
be fine with everything. And then life
is easy. You wake in the morning. I told
you. You wake up in the morning, I&#39;m
back. Oh, it&#39;s still here. Wow. I gave
you that whole talk, too. What&#39;s the
probability? If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m going do
it very quickly. If it&#39;s true that all
that out there is atoms, that&#39;s all it
is. Molecules made up of atoms made up
of electron protons made up of little
activations in a field of energy that
vibrates. There are no electron protons.
There&#39;s just quantum level field that
gets agitated like a lake that&#39;s still
and a leaf drops in it. Then there&#39;s
ripples. There&#39;s ripples. It&#39;s no
there&#39;s no form. There&#39;s no particles.
They&#39;ve already seen that. There&#39;s just
wavelets. And those wavelets interact
together to form the appearance of
particles. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on. So
when you wake up in my my mind literally
does this. You wake up in the morning,
look around. It&#39;s still here. What&#39;s the
probability that&#39;s still there? That&#39;s
those wavelets. It&#39;s not like God
created the heavens and earth. It is
being created. Every single moment that
those wavelets are moving is creating
electron protons and the atoms and
they&#39;re still here. You have a dresser.
You have a bed. You have a body. It
should be miraculous to you. Einstein
had a quote. I like this quote. I like
Einstein a lot. He said that reality is
just an illusion, albeit a very
persistent one. So those wavelets come
up, they create this and it&#39;s still
there. And all you care about is to be
the way you want. You&#39;re like blown away
that these little wavelets end up making
all this and making your eyeballs that
see it this way. It&#39;s phenomenal. You
look for miracles. It&#39;s a miracle. The
whole thing&#39;s a miracle beyond your
comprehension.
All right. That&#39;s why life can be
simple. First you see why it&#39;s
complicated. You made it complicated.
It&#39;s really very simple. You sit there
and what happens? You get to appreciate
it and be blown away. And you get to
interact with it. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s like
playing a video game. You get to go out
there to sport. It&#39;s a sport. You have
to interact with life. But you have to
understand what you&#39;re interacting with.
Just this this creation, this planet. Oh
my god. All right. Spirituality can be
very simple. And that&#39;s what I want to
talk about. If you stop screwing things
up with your mind,
we talked about that. How do you do
that? Stop setting aside what you like
and dislike. Just enjoy the thing.
What&#39;s going to happen? You want to have
that stuff stored in there. How would
you like to not have that garbage stored
inside of you from your past, the things
that happened 5 years ago, 10 years ago,
20 years ago, 30 years ago, 5 minutes
ago. What if it didn&#39;t get stuck in
there? You&#39;re going to learn yoga, true
yoga, true spirituality. What we&#39;re
going to discuss,
just imagine for a moment there&#39;s no
stuff in there. Doesn&#39;t mean no memory.
You can bring it back if you want to,
just like a computer can bring back, but
it&#39;s not stuck in there trying to get
out, trying to release the garbage you
stored in there. That&#39;s why your mind&#39;s
negative. That&#39;s why you have all these
problems because it doesn&#39;t want to be
in there. And it causes big trouble. How
would you like to not have that in
there? You have to wake up in the
morning and the past is the past. It
happened. I was fine with it. I dealt
with it. I handled it. It&#39;s gone. Bring
it on. I&#39;m right here. Be here now. I&#39;m
right here. What is going to happen as
you get there? It&#39;s not all or nothing.
I&#39;m gonna tell you what&#39;s going to
happen. You&#39;re gonna learn about this
stuff called shockti. It&#39;s beyond my
comprehension that human beings don&#39;t
know what shockti is because that&#39;s what
you&#39;re going to find is that when you
don&#39;t have that garbage in there,
there&#39;s this flow that just starts
coming up inside of you and it&#39;s always
going up. It doesn&#39;t go down. It just
goes up. Just like when you get high,
it&#39;s up. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called high.
Every single high experience you ever
had was a shocked experience. Everything
second chakra, winning, love, every
single thing is the same thing. When
your stuff is not in the way, this shock
flows. There&#39;s just this upward rush of
energy. If it comes out a given chakra,
then it behaves a different way.
Eventually, you catch on. If I don&#39;t
have stuff in here, it doesn&#39;t have to
come out. It just goes up. It just wave
upon wave of ecstasy pours through your
being all the time, day and night. Like
everything in the lower centers, they
look like child play. There&#39;s nothing is
high as a constant upward flow. It&#39;s
just pouring inside. That is your
natural state. Every single one of you,
that is what&#39;s going on in there. You
have to do anything. What you have to do
is not do something, which is block it.
Your natural state is where the great
masters are is this constant upward flow
of shock. Now you don&#39;t feel it unless
certain circumstances you get what you
want. You feel it. Why? Because you
blocked it by not getting what you want.
You blocked it with all your preferences
and all the garbage you stored in there
from your past. All the stuff you stored
in there. All the stuff you shoved down
in there is blocking your shocki flow.
It&#39;s not about having to get things to
be a certain way so you get to have
shakti. You have to stop needing things
to be a certain way and you let go of
those preferences and the judgments and
all that garbage. The more you thin out
in there, the more shocked you feel. And
it&#39;s not all or nothing. You just start
feeling more. You start happier because
even when you get happy, you fall in
love. How long does it last? How long is
that puppy love first love at first
sight? Oh my god, I can&#39;t wait to see
each other. What happened? Can it not
flow all the time? cannot feel that tre
I&#39;m going to talk about the honeymoon
phase where you just feel this love
pouring through your heart and you can&#39;t
wait to see somebody you see them
excited you think about them just think
about them it goes surely you felt that
doesn&#39;t last because it doesn&#39;t last why
because something happens in the
relationship that you don&#39;t like they
didn&#39;t say what you wanted them to when
you were with your parents something
happened they forgot the anniversary
there you go you have these preferences
you built in there and So now what you
do is you store the fact that you didn&#39;t
get what you wanted. And so now if every
single thing you store in there blocks
your shocki flow. You know it because of
love. Can people do things that turn you
off? Can you love somebody tremendously
and have them do one thing? You don&#39;t
even need them to do anything. Can you
think that maybe they might do
something?
You don&#39;t feel as much love as you did
before I had that thought. See, I&#39;m
telling you, I&#39;m proving to you, you are
blocking your shocki flow with that
stuff you store in there. If you get rid
of that stuff, you have no idea how high
you are. But instead of getting rid of
the stuff, you try to manipulate the
world so that you feel open. It&#39;s a
losing situation. What you need to do is
stop closing. How do you stop closing? I
told you, stop setting up these likes
and dislikes. So, spirituality is about
cleaning out inside. It is about
cleaning out the stuff you have in
there. What happens if you do that? You
start feeling a shocky flow. But when
you feel the shock flow, it&#39;s very nice.
It&#39;s very nice. So all of a sudden you
like it more
than you like the feeling that somebody
else said what you wanted. What if you
were so filled with ecstasy that you
don&#39;t care what people think about you?
It&#39;s just pouring inside of you.
Somebody walks up and says, &#34;You stupid
idiot. You can be nice and you don&#39;t
laugh. Just feel, you know, talk about
handling your liquor. They&#39;re great
beings can handle the shocki. You can
walk through this world feeling that
tremendous flow of energy and just sit
there very nicely and let people talk
and bring that energy out. That shakti
is creative, tremendously creative for
everything, anything you do. Now, I&#39;m
going to talk about shakti. So, that is
a natural energy. It&#39;s your divine
energy, God energy. It&#39;s a shocki flow
that&#39;s flowing inside of you, inside
everybody. So you just get to the point
you understand it is all about shocki
and it&#39;s all about the blockages
in yoga we call the blockages samscaras
every one of them is samscara a blocked
energy flow that&#39;s stored inside of you
that is messing up your shocki flow but
you know that the more something matches
what you like and they shift around they
shift all the time are you moody
a yogi a great me has no moods has no
moods here&#39;s the mood who I&#39;m telling
you that is your natural state. Period.
Don&#39;t let anybody tell you anything
different. You&#39;re a human being. That&#39;s
your natural state. You evolved to the
point that that much shocki is pouring
through you. You have blocked it with
that stuff you stored inside. So shocki
and samscaras, those are two things you
want to know. Every single thing there&#39;s
about all right. The shocki flow is the
meaning of life. It&#39;s every everything
you&#39;re doing. Everyone&#39;s doing is trying
to get shock to flow. They don&#39;t know
that. I&#39;m trying to get her to love me.
Why? Because my shocki flows. Everything
is samscaras on top of the shakti. So
spirituality is always the same. It is
about you have to find the shakti. The
shakti is finding you. It&#39;s there all
the time. You have to let go of the
blockages. You let go of the blockages
and you stop putting more in there.
That&#39;s your spiritual path. Let go of
the samscars and stop putting more in.
If it&#39;s true what I said to you and it
is then underneath all that is this
beautiful flow of spirit of shaky
pouring inside of you then what are you
going to go find it somewhere it&#39;s
inside of you you shouldn&#39;t have to do
anything to get what&#39;s there you have to
stop blocking it so all of spirituality
all of yoga all of everything is about
letting go of the blockages then the
question becomes how do you do that how
do you get rid of these samscars
Don&#39;t tell them I told you this. I tell
you a secret. They want out more than
you want them out. It is not natural to
your heart or your mind to have that
garbage stored in there that they&#39;re
blocking the energy flow. They want the
energy flow. People say, &#34;But why is my
mind so negative?&#34; Because you stored
negativity inside of you. It is trying
to release. And in order to release, it
has to make it past your mind.
Therefore, all this garbage is coming
inside your mind. Why is my heart so
sensitive? Because you store all this
garbage inside and it&#39;s sick. If your
body is sick, all the immune system
tries to get all that junk out of there.
Your temperature goes up. This happened,
pain, all that&#39;s part of the process, in
the body&#39;s trying to cleanse. Your
higher bodies, your mental body and your
emotional body, they&#39;re trying to
cleanse that garbage out of there.
That&#39;s why it keeps pushing it up. And
there&#39;s a secret. How do I get it out?
If that&#39;s true, and it is, believe me,
that the shocki flow is the most
beautiful. It is the only beauty you&#39;ve
ever experienced in your entire life.
You hear a piece of music. Oh, you melt
into it. While your shock open, I&#39;ll
tell you what, have it be your song that
you fell in love with somebody and it&#39;s
our song. You know what I mean? It&#39;s our
song, right? Every time you hear it, oh,
you bliss out like right now. Break up
and see the next time you hear the song.
Does it bliss you out? Freaks you out.
You did that. It&#39;s the same song. Am I
proving this to you yet? You are
screwing yourself up by storing this
stuff inside. How do you get rid of it?
You have to do all this intense yoga,
intense tapasio. Have you noticed it
comes up by itself? Have you noticed you
see a sign makes you think of something
you hear a word, you have a smell, walk
into a kitchen, reminds you of your
mother or the cooking or or last time
you got sick at a restaurant. It comes
up by itself. It is supposed to do that.
Your heart and your mind are trying to
cleanse you of this stuff you stored in
there. The trouble is when it comes up,
you don&#39;t like it. You tell people, &#34;I
told you not to talk about that. You
know, I don&#39;t like to talk about that.&#34;
In other words, I I like being blocked.
Leave me alone. Just don&#39;t touch it.
Don&#39;t touch it so it doesn&#39;t hurt. Your
attitude has to change to grow
spiritually. It has to be, &#34;Come on up.
I don&#39;t want you in there.&#34; It was
stored with pain. It&#39;s going to come
back with pain. You stored the energy of
the experience and stored the emotions,
stored them, the thoughts, stored
everything, doesn&#39;t it? Have you ever
had experience where something happened
and you just went back to your
childhood? There&#39;s felt like you did
when you were seven. People say that I I
can&#39;t believe it. I went and visited my
house where I used to grow up and all
these thoughts and feelings came back.
It was really either wonderful or
freaky. Yes or no? Why? Because you
store them in there and they&#39;re being
stimulated. Spirituality is about
saying, &#34;I&#39;m not going to do that. can&#39;t
get there all at once. Just like you
don&#39;t learn to play piano all at once,
you practice. You don&#39;t learn to play a
sport all at once, you practice. You
practice how to let go of these things
of the samscaras when they come up
instead of trying to build a life that
they don&#39;t come up or they do come up if
you like them. Now, your entire
reflection of your life is just a
projection of all that junk you stored
inside. It should be all you see is
ecstasy, beauty, the creation, God. It&#39;s
unbelievable. That&#39;s all you see. It&#39;s
unbelievable. They all exist. But you
have to be willing to let go your stuff.
And so, first you change your attitude.
Change your attitude. Wait a minute. I
want this stuff to come up. Do I have to
go find it and make it come up? No. It
will find you. Just find. It finds you
every single day of your life. Every
time you see somebody, you don&#39;t see
somebody. Somebody says something. You
know what? You have as much trouble if
somebody says something as if they
didn&#39;t say something or how they said
it. So, what do you do? You practice
being okay. If you want to be okay,
practice being okay. It&#39;s called
unconditional love. Unconditional
well-being, not conditional. Conditional
means it has to be the way you want for
you to feel okay. I don&#39;t want that. We
have to fight to be okay. I want to just
be okay. All right? And you can. You
are. But you can&#39;t with all that stuff
in there. So every day you wake up in
the morning. This is my prescription for
spiritual growth. You wake up in the
morning and you say, &#34;I&#39;m back. I know I
have a bunch of junk in there. I can&#39;t
get it out all at once, but this is how
I&#39;m devote my day. I&#39;m not going to put
more in today.&#34;
And you keep putting more in. There&#39;s no
reason to get any out. And plus, it&#39;s a
lifo stack. Last in, first out. When you
push stuff in, that&#39;s the stuff that
comes up first. And then the deeper
stuff doesn&#39;t come up until something
happens. So, you just devote yourself to
say, &#34;I&#39;m going to make a game today.
I&#39;m not putting more in. How do you do
that? Things are going to happen that
make me not feel comfortable and I&#39;m
going to let go. I&#39;m going to say, &#34;Come
on up. Welcome. You&#39;re welcome in here
cuz I don&#39;t want you down there. I don&#39;t
want you down there.&#34; And somebody says
something, a friend of yours doesn&#39;t act
the way you expected them to. Big deal.
I can handle it. That becomes your
mantra. I can handle it. I can handle
it. Handle what reality? And you just
keep letting go. How do you let go? How
do you let go? You don&#39;t resist.
Something comes up. You have this
tendency to resist it. I don&#39;t like it.
I don&#39;t want to deal with this. I don&#39;t
want you to say what you said. I don&#39;t
want you to do what you did. There&#39;s
this resistance. You know what I&#39;m
talking about. You pushed away in there.
Fight. Don&#39;t do that. That&#39;s all you
have to do is don&#39;t resist. Relax.
Relaxation is the opposite of
resistance. And repeat that. Relaxation
is the opposite of resistance. When
you&#39;re resisting, you&#39;re not relaxing.
When you&#39;re relaxing, you&#39;re not
resisting. Relax. But it hurts. Yeah, it
does. You can&#39;t handle the big stuff
yet. I know. But you can handle little
stuff. You can handle the weather.
Driver in front of you, but somebody
said what you think that somebody might
have thought. Then he just did it
What if he&#39;s thinking that? How do I
know he&#39;s not? Stop it. What do you want
to make a mess yourself for? Just relax.
Let go. Let it go. Don&#39;t fight it. Let
it go. It will pass over time and then
you&#39;ll get better at it and better at it
and you&#39;ll start to feel a shaky flow.
It doesn&#39;t take that long. People write
me from all over the world. Oh, I felt
this rush of energy because you&#39;re not
blocked and you keep letting go and you
never stop. I told you spirituality
simple there. What&#39;s spirituality? Relax
through the tendency to resist. just
keep relaxing and then something bigger
will come up. And when you get a really
big one, you got some stuff in there,
don&#39;t you? And it comes up and it hurts.
You I don&#39;t want it in there. I don&#39;t
want it in there. Relax. Oh, it&#39;s hard.
Well, no pain, no gain. When you lift
the waist, look at the Olympics. The
Olympic people want to run the Olympics
for years. Look what they go through.
What do they get? A medal. You get
shaky. Unending flow of ecstasy, ever
new joy. it&#39;s worth going through it.
And so you just keep relaxing every day
a little bit. At night you sit down. Did
I keep anything? And the answer is of
course you did. Nobody&#39;s perfect at
this. You don&#39;t want to be perfect. You
just want to do it. You hear me?
Practice makes perfect. You just keep
practicing. Letting go. At night you see
stuff still in there. Neutralize it.
Think of something positive. Offer it to
God. Let it go. Think about the fact
that if it&#39;s in there, it takes that
much much longer for me to feel that
shocki flow.
And so you let it go. It&#39;s inspiring.
And then eventually, I&#39;m telling you,
you&#39;ll feel this flow. And you&#39;ll notice
that that flow will be there till you
decide to not have it be there. Till
somebody says something you don&#39;t like.
And you traded this beautiful flow of
shocki for the person not saying what
they said. Who cares? Right? You&#39;ll get
to that point. It&#39;s fine. Say what you
need to say. You had a bad day. Fine.
And not a problem. I&#39;ll tell you what.
I&#39;ll set up a little stand and I&#39;ll tell
you what I&#39;ll do. I will give you a
dollar for every $100 you give me.
Come on. That&#39;s what you do when you
give the shock flow is what somebody
said or didn&#39;t say or did or didn&#39;t do.
All right. All right. So, I started this
conversation by telling you life is very
simple. You said a little planet spins
around space for a few years. Why are
you making a mess? And I told you why.
Cuz you decided things had to be a
certain way for you to be okay. And then
you made a mess of yourself. So
spirituality is about saying, &#34;I&#39;m not
going to do that. I&#39;m not going to do
that. I&#39;m going to let go. Things
happen. Going to let go.&#34; Again, back to
Zen. Flowers are red.
Okay. Flowers can be red. Water is blue.
Oh no. Okay. The water can be blue.
Grass is green. Not that too. Yes. Okay.
There you&#39;re free.
That&#39;s what it&#39;s teaching you. Zen is
teaching you that level. Okay. All
right. Shakti samscaras.
As you let go of samscaras, you&#39;ll feel
that shakti. As you put more samscars in
there, there&#39;s more blockages. Makes it
all conditional. All right. I hope you
understand these things because you&#39;re a
very great being. Check.
