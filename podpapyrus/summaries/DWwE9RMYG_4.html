I&#39;ve read all these books on
procrastination and I got to tell you,
we&#39;ve been lied to. It turns out
procrastination is actually the secret
to finding your purpose and growing your
business. I know that sounds crazy, but
stick with me. First, did you know that
according to several studies, the
average entrepreneur wastes 55 days per
year avoiding necessary work. If you&#39;re
an entrepreneur, think about how much
opportunity and money that&#39;s costing
you. And I can relate. I dealt with
crippling procrastination,
self-sabotage, and imposter syndrome
that kept me stuck for over a decade
until I discovered something that I call
the power code, which is the secret to
using these self-defeating behaviors to
discover your life&#39;s purpose and
mission. And once I understood this, my
whole life changed. The very next
business that I got my hands on, I took
to over 140 million in sales, was
featured in major media publications,
and spoke on the biggest stages in the
world before selling that company in
2024. Everything that I&#39;m about to show
you is sciencebacked and proven. It
comes from two primary fields of study.
Axiology, the study of values, and
teology, the study of purpose. Through
the lens of axiology, we can observe
that every human being is driven by a
code, an unconscious set of values that
governs all of our actions and inactions
in life. And when I say values, I&#39;m not
talking about honesty, integrity,
respect, fairness, justice. Those are
great, but those are also social ideals.
Instead, what I&#39;m talking about here is
the fact that every day that you and I
wake up, there&#39;s the things that we
value most in our life down to the
things that we potentially don&#39;t value
at all. And more than just dictating our
actions and inactions, this code also
dictates how we spend our resources. As
entrepreneurs, our primary resources are
time, energy, and money. Wouldn&#39;t you
agree that however we invest our time,
energy, and money will ultimately become
our destiny? So every day we wake up
with a finite amount of these resources
and it&#39;s going to get invested in direct
proportion to the code. The things we
value most get the most of our resources
and the next and the next and the next
until eventually we start running out of
time, energy and money long before we
run out of things that we ought to do,
need to do, have to do and must do in
order to get results in our business.
Now here is where things get really
juicy. We can also observe that when we
pursue the top three to five things that
we value most, that&#39;s when we unlock
purpose, meaning, fulfillment,
alignment, we have diligence, fortitude,
followthrough, inspiration, meaning
we&#39;re moved by the spirit within. And
life feels almost effortless and results
seem to come naturally. You&#39;ve probably
experienced this before. It feels like
everything is just clicking for you. But
when we begin to pursue the things that
are down here, which often times are our
goals, but they&#39;re in conflict with what
we value most, well, then we begin to
defy the code. And when we defy the
code, we create symptoms. Symptoms
include procrastination, hesitation,
frustration, self-sabotage, imposttor
syndrome, and so on. Think about how
magnificent this is for a moment. That
means that our bodies are literally
physiologically designed to wake us up
when we begin to stray away from our
purpose. Our neurology is wired like a
homing beacon to keep us on path with
our life&#39;s mission. Do you think that
God, the universe, nature, whatever you
want to call it, you know, created this
magnificent human being and then
infected you with procrastination as
some sort of a cruel joke? Or don&#39;t you
think it&#39;s much more likely that this
has served a purpose all along, but we
live in a world that&#39;s telling us that
it&#39;s bad, that it&#39;s awful, that it&#39;s
wrong, and that you have to get away
from it. Now, when we resist it, when we
fight it, we remain prisoner to it.
You&#39;ve probably heard before that
whatever we resist persists. And so, how
would this be any different? Now, here&#39;s
where things get really magical. If you
want to overcome the procrastination,
the hesitation, the frustration, and
begin taking new actions in your
business, all we need to do is move the
things that are down here up here and
get it inside of your power code. And
suddenly, you will find yourself
following through on these things
naturally, effortlessly. It&#39;ll feel like
it&#39;s just unconsciously happening for
you. Rather than you having to use
force, you can step into power. Doing
this takes just two simple steps. Step
one, discover what your unique power
code is. And step two, align your goals
with your power code. Today, I&#39;ve helped
thousands of entrepreneurs do exactly
that. It&#39;s why we have a 4.9 rating on
Trustpilot and an A&#43; rating with the
Better Business Bureau, and dozens of
clients who came to us stuck, burnt out,
and frustrated have gone on to earn
millions of dollars in their business.
So, listen. If this speaks to you and
you&#39;re tired of spinning your wheels and
don&#39;t want to lose any more sleep at
night, wondering if you&#39;re going to work
your whole life and never live up to
your full potential, then I&#39;ve got good
news. I&#39;ve put together a free
assessment you can access on the next
page. In just 30 minutes, you&#39;ll have a
crystal clear blueprint for why you
procrastinate and exactly how to break
free. No more guessing, no more forcing
yourself to stay motivated, just clarity
of purpose and action steps that
actually work. Click the button around
this video and download your free
assessment today. Think about it. How
much does procrastination, limiting
belief, self-doubt, and imposture
syndrome already cost you. Can you
really afford to keep paying those
prices? Of course, you could read all
these books, studies, and more like I
have, or you could just skip to the end
result and download the assessment right
now. So, click the link that&#39;s somewhere
around this video, head on over to the
next page, and download your free copy
of the Power Code Assessment. In just a
few minutes, you could be on the path to
breaking free from self-defeating
behavior just like myself and thousands
of others already have. Click the link
down below and I&#39;ll see you there.
