slave breeding, medical experimentation,
and rampant human trafficking. Such
inhumane practices spanned for
centuries, not just in the Americas, but
through various countries all around the
world. Slavery is a sin that some want
to forget, and a truth that we must
refuse to let die. It is a chapter in
human history full of immense suffering
and injustice. These stories have been
buried within time and hidden beneath
tales of progress. But we must dig into
these stories so we may reflect on them
as one must remember the mistakes of
history so such may never be repeated.
That said, let us sail into this journey
of remembrance and commemoration for all
of our brothers and sisters who suffered
through the harsh eras of slavery. That
said, let&#39;s open our hearts to
remembrance as we take a look at 25
historical facts about slavery that are
certainly haunting. Give this video a

insightful discussions. With that, let&#39;s
Number one, slave breeding. A horrifying
practice that came shortly after the
abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.
And yes, it is as terrible as it sounds.
Because slave owners could no longer
import slaves from Africa, these people
with their greed and cruelty devised
slave breeding as a new abhorrent
practice to increase their workforce and
profits. Simply put, slave breeding was
the systematic forcing of slaves to have
children to increase the wealth of their
owners. Slave owners would select
enslaved men and women for breeding
based on perceived desirable traits such
as physical strength or perceived
fertility and would sometimes offer
rewards for enslaved women who bore many
children or punish those who resisted.
This abhorrent practice not only
violated the basic human rights of
enslaved people but also tore families
apart. Children born into slavery were
often separated from their mothers at a
young age, sold or put to work. Number
two, medical experimentation.
During the antibbellum period in the
United States, enslaved individuals were
often subjected to painful and dangerous
procedures without their consent. Their
bodies seen as expendable resources for
medical research and experimentation.
One notable example of this was the work
of Dr. James Marian Sims. Known as the
father of modern gynecology, Sims
conducted numerous experimental
surgeries on enslaved women without
anesthesia. Despite the excruciating
pain and potentially life-threatening
nature of his experiments, Sims legally
needed permission only from the enslaved
women&#39;s owners, he performed painful
experiments without anesthesia on Lucy,
an enslaved black woman. While other
doctors observed Sims experiments on
Lucy were unsuccessful and nearly killed
her due to severe blood poisoning.
Nevertheless, he continued performing
procedures on other enslaved women,
sometimes drugging them to prevent
resistance. Sims subjected Anarcha, an
enslaved teenager, to at least 13
operations without anesthesia before he
developed a repair technique considered
safe to attempt on white patients.
Unable to refuse treatment or withhold
consent, Lucy, Anarcha, and Sims&#39;s other
enslaved patients were powerless against
medical exploitation. During and after
enslavement, physicians often denied
black people basic dignity and
personhood, reflecting the dehumanizing
myth that black people were less
sensitive to pain than white people.
Although Sims was historically praised
for his contributions to medicine,
people are now acknowledging the cruel
and inhumane treatment he inflicted on
black women during his experiments. As a
result of this re-evaluation, a statue
of Sims was removed from Central Park in
New York City in April 2018. although
another statue of him still remains at
the Alabama state capital. Number three,
savage dogs were used to hunt runaway
slaves. Escaped slaves presented a
challenge for slaveholders as they were
difficult to track and potentially
dangerous to apprehend. In response,
plantation owners developed a terrifying
solution. Breeding vicious dogs
specifically for the purpose of hunting
down runaways.
These dogs are often a mix of powerful
breeds like blood hounds and bulldogs.
They were trained to track, attack, and
capture escape slaves with aggression.
The use of these dogs instilled terror
in the hearts of enslaved individuals as
they became symbols of the brutality and
dehumanization inherent in the slave
system. In a twisted display of power,
slaveholders often allowed the dogs to
maul captured runaways, inflicting
severe injuries before subduing the
animals. This practice served not only
as a form of punishment, but also as a
chilling warning to other slaves who
might contemplate escaping. Number four,
the Zong mass killing. In 1781, the
captain of the slave ship Zong ordered
the drowning of 132 enslaved Africans
during their journey to Jamaica. Upon
returning to England, the ship&#39;s owners
sought compensation for their lost cargo
from their insurer. The case might have
been successful if not for Ola Ecuano, a
formerly enslaved man living in England.
He learned of the Zong mass killing and
brought it to the attention of an
abolitionist friend, leading to a court
case. Initially, the court ruled in
favor of the ship owners, likening the
enslaved Africans to animals that could
be killed for the ship&#39;s safety.
However, the insurance company appealed
and in the retrial, the court recognized
the enslaved Africans as people, not
property. Number five, a black man owned
slaves. In the 17th century, a black man
named Anthony Johnson was brought to
Virginia as an indentured servant.
Indentured servitude is a type of labor
arrangement where a person agrees to
work for free for a set period of time
in exchange for something like debt
repayment or travel expenses. After
Anthony had finished his indentured
servitude, he eventually gained his
freedom and acquired land and servants,
even legally owning a black man named
John Quazor for life. This has been used
by some to argue that slavery was not
rooted in racism, but rather economics
as a black man was also a slave owner.
However, this story is quite misleading.
The first documented case of a lifetime
enslavement in the colonies was that of
John Punch, a black man sentenced to
lifetime servitude for attempting to
escape his indenture in 1640. His white
companions who escaped with him received
only additional years on their
indenture. Doesn&#39;t this show the early
unequal treatment for black individuals?
His descendants were ultimately
dispossessed of their land and likely
lost their freedom due to increasing
anti-lack racism in the colony. While
Johnson&#39;s story is unique, it is often
misused to downplay the role of racism
in American slavery. Number six, slaves
were branded like cattle. Branding
enslaved people was a brutal practice
used by slave owners throughout history,
including in the American colonies.
Branding was not only a way to mark
property, but also a form of punishment
and dehumanization. The practice dates
back to ancient times and was used
extensively during the transatlantic
slave trade. Abolitionists highlighted
the brutality of branding to expose the
inhumity of slavery. Different methods
were employed with heated irons being
the most common, but acid and gunpowder
were also used in some cases. Branding
left lasting physical and psychological
scars on enslaved individuals, a
constant reminder of their
dehumanization.
As such, some individuals attempted to
alter or remove their brands as a form
of resistance and defiance. Number
seven, Africans sold slaves.
The Atlantic slave trade involved the
active participation of African rulers
and traders who sold fellow Africans,
often prisoners of war, to European
slave ships. This exchange was not
one-sided as African leaders received
valuable European goods, particularly
weapons, in return for slaves. These
weapons facilitated further conquests
leading to a cycle of warfare and
enslavement within Africa. Contrary to
popular belief, the initial trade
between Europeans and Africans did not
involve slaves. African rulers initially
traded ivory and gold for European
goods. However, the demand for slave
labor in the Americas led to a shift in
this trade with enslaved Africans
becoming a significant commodity in the
exchange. This contributed to the
devastating impact of the slave trade on
African societies, fueling conflict and
instability for centuries. Number eight,
free black individuals were abducted and
sold back into slavery. The Underground
Railroad, a network of safe houses
aiding enslaved people in their escape
to freedom, emerged before the Civil
War. However, a counter network known as
the Reverse Underground Railroad arose
in response. This system involved
kidnapping runaway slaves and free black
individuals in the north, transporting
them to the south, and selling them back
into slavery. These kidnapped free
blacks faced immense challenges in
proving their freedom due to biased
court systems that often dismissed their
documentation as forged. Additionally,
laws prohibiting blacks from testifying
against whites in court further hampered
their ability to defend themselves. The
reverse underground railroad is one of
the persistent threats of reinslavement
faced by black individuals, even in
supposedly free states and the systemic
racism embedded within the legal system.
Number nine, 25 years old men were the
best slaves.
Slaveholders driven by the pursuit of
profit provided enslaved individuals
with only the bare minimum for survival,
forcing them to toil from dawn till
dusk. In a perverse twist, young women
were often valued more than men until
puberty due to their potential to bear
children who would also be enslaved. The
most valuable slaves were considered to
be men around 25 years old. Due to their
perceived peak physical ability and
potential for labor output, this callous
disregard for human life and the
reduction of individuals to mere
commodities proves the dehumanizing
nature of slavery. The value placed on
enslaved people was not based on their
inherent worth as human beings, but
rather on their potential for economic
exploitation. This commodification of
human life was a fundamental aspect of
the slave system, shaping the
experiences of enslaved individuals and
perpetuating the cycle of oppression.
Number 10, slave owners used a different
kind of Bible just to justify slavery.
In an attempt to indoctrinate enslaved
people into Christianity while
maintaining control, slaveholders in the
British West Indies created a heavily
edited version of the Bible known as the
Slave Bible. This version excluded
passages that could potentially inspire
rebellion, such as the Israelites exodus
from Egypt, and emphasized stories that
seem to normalize slavery, like the tale
of Joseph&#39;s enslavement. The slave Bible
served as a tool of manipulation, aiming
to quell any thoughts of resistance
among the enslaved population. The
creators of this altered text, whether
plantation owners or missionaries,
sought to instill a sense of acceptance
of their subjugated status in the
slaves. This act of religious censorship
highlights the lengths to which those in
power would go to maintain control and
suppress disscent. Number 11, fleeing
slaves were considered mentally ill.
Samuel Cartwright, a physician in the
pro-slavery American South, used his
medical expertise to uphold the
institution of slavery. He published a
report that falsely claimed black people
were biologically inferior to whites
with smaller brains and immature nervous
systems, making them naturally suited
for servitude. He even went so far as to
assert that black individuals could only
find happiness in slavery. In a blatant
attempt to pathize resistance,
Cartwright invented a mental disorder
called drapeto mania, supposedly
afflicting slaves who attempted to
escape their masters. He prescribed
inhumane treatments for this fake
condition, including whippings and
amputations. Number 12. Slaves laziness
was also considered a mental disorder.
Not content with inventing drapetomania,
Samuel Cartwright also fabricated
another fictitious mental disorder
called disesthesia ethiopica, which he
falsely claimed caused laziness in
enslaved people. According to
Cartwright, this condition stemmed from
decreased skin sensitivity leading to
sluggishness and a perceived lack of
effort. Cartwright paradoxically
asserted that this illness was more
prevalent in free black individuals due
to a supposed lack of care from masters.
His proposed cure involved washing the
affected skin, applying oil, and forcing
the person to work under the sun, after
which he believed they would be
Number 13. Black people were arrested
for being unemployed. The abolition of
slavery after the Civil War caused
economic instability in the South, where
the economy heavily relied on slave
labor. However, a loophole in the 13th
Amendment, which abolished slavery
except as punishment for a crime, was
exploited by southern states. They began
arresting black individuals
indiscriminately, often for minor
offenses or even unemployment, leading
to their imprisonment and subsequent
leasing to private businesses for forced
labor. This convict leasing system
effectively replaced slavery, subjecting
over 200,000 black people to brutal
working conditions and inhumane
treatment. The least convicts were
forced to perform dangerous tasks under
harsh conditions, enduring whippings and
chains. In other words, black people
were arrested for doing nothing. Number
14, the continuation of the illegal
slave trade. Despite the formal end of
the slave trade, illicit trafficking
persisted, yielding substantial profits
for those involved. During the 19th
century, an estimated 1.65 million
enslaved Africans were transported
across the Atlantic, frequently on
American vessels, revealing the
continued involvement of governments and
corporations in this abhorrent trade.
The illegal slave trade had a
devastating impact on African societies,
leading to increased violence,
instability, and economic disruption.
The capture and forced migration of
millions of people, disrupted
communities, fueled conflicts, and
hindered the development of local
economies. Number 15. Slave quarters
were horrible. Slave quarters were the
housing provided to enslaved people on
plantations and farms during the era of
slavery in the United States. These
dwellings varied greatly depending on
location, time period, and the slave
owner&#39;s wealth. The most common type was
the one room cabin, often made of wood
or logs with dirt floors and minimal
amenities. Some enslaved people lived in
larger structures divided into units,
while others inhabited converted
outbuildings. Overcrowding, poor
construction, and lack of basic
sanitation were common, leading to
unsanitary conditions and the spread of
disease. Enslaved people suffered from a
range of health problems and
psychological trauma due to these harsh
living conditions. The lack of privacy
and autonomy further exacerbated their
plight. Number 16, slave codes. These
were laws that treated enslaved people
as property rather than human beings.
The laws aimed to protect slave owners
from potential uprisings or violence by
limiting the rights and freedoms of
enslaved individuals. This included
controlling their movement, assembly,
education, and family life. Back then,
the threat of slave rebellions was a
constant concern for slave owners,
leading to the enactment of harsher and
more restrictive slave codes over time.
These laws not only regulated the
behavior of enslaved people, but also
defined their legal status based on
race. Any person with African ancestry,
regardless of their free or enslaved
status, was considered black under these
codes. Additionally, the status of a
child followed that of the mother,
meaning that if a mother was enslaved,
her child would be as well, even if the
father was free. The specific provisions
of slave codes varied across colonies
and states, but they all shared the
common goal of maintaining the
institution of slavery and the racial
hierarchy it relied on. These codes
ultimately stripped enslaved people of
their basic human rights and subjected
them to a life of oppression and
exploitation. Number 17, the domestic
slave trade.
In 1808, the United States Congress
prohibited the importation of African
slaves, a move hailed by abolitionists
as a step towards justice. However, this
seemingly progressive act had unintended
consequences. It inadvertently fueled
the growth of a domestic slave trade, a
cruel system that tore families apart
and displaced an estimated 1.2 million
individuals, most of whom were born in
America. This internal trade cast a long
shadow over the lives of enslaved
people. The constant threat of being
sold and separated from loved ones
created a pervasive atmosphere of fear
and uncertainty. The prospect of being
sent to the harsh conditions of the
Louisiana sugar plantations with their
grueling labor and high mortality rates
was a terrifying reality for many.
Number 18, the Underground Railroad. In
the era of slavery, the Underground
Railroad was a network of roots and safe
havens that facilitated the escape of
enslaved people from the American South
to the North. The term underground
railroad was metaphorical as it was not
an actual railroad and did not run
underground. Instead, it facilitated
long-d distanceance escapes through
homes, barns, churches, and businesses.
The people involved in the Underground
Railroad were driven by a profound
commitment to justice and the abolition
of slavery. And their dedication was so
strong that they risked their own lives
and freedom to assist enslaved people in
their journey to safety. Between 1810
and 1850, the Underground Railroad
helped guide 100,000 enslaved people to
freedom. Conductors led runaway enslaved
people from one location to another
along the routes. The safe places that
provided shelter were known as stations,
and those who hid the escapees were
called station masters. The escaping
individuals were referred to as
passengers, and once they reached the
safe houses, they were termed cargo.
Number 19, slave labor in urban and
rural settings. Enslaved individuals
were not limited to rural plantations.
They also played a significant role in
the labor force of urban areas like
Boston, New York, Charleston, Richmond,
and Baltimore, demonstrating the
widespread nature of slavery throughout
various settings. In urban areas,
enslaved people worked in a variety of
occupations, including domestic service,
skilled trades, and industrial labor.
They were blacksmiths, carpenters,
seamstresses, cooks, and laresses,
contributing to the economic development
of these cities. Despite their essential
role in urban life, enslaved individuals
in cities faced unique challenges,
including limited social mobility and
increased surveillance. Number 20,
resistance and the fight for abolition.
Enslaved Africans never stopped fighting
for their freedom. Their spirit was
strong and their resistance gave hope to
others facing oppression. They fought
back in many ways from small acts of
defiance to large-scale rebellions.
Their bravery and determination inspired
generations to fight for their own
liberation. One powerful example of this
was the Haitian Revolution in the late
1700s. Enslaved people in the French
colony of Saint Doming rose up against
their oppressors, ultimately
overthrowing French rule and declaring
their independence. They renamed their
nation Haiti, and this act sparked many
more revolutions to end slavery in all
of France&#39;s colonies. Number 21.
Resistance and revolts aboard slave
ships. Enslaved Africans frequently
resisted the brutal conditions aboard
slave ships, too, leading to rebellions
on an estimated 10% of all voyages,
especially near the African coast. They
fought back against their capttors using
various tactics such as refusing food
and water, jumping overboard, and even
organizing armed uprisings. These acts
of defiance, though met with harsh
reprisals, forced slave traders to
increase security measures,
inadvertently raising their costs, and
limiting the number of voyages they
could undertake. Number 22. The
terrifying impact of Nat Turner&#39;s
revolt. Nat Turner&#39;s 1831 rebellion in
Virginia struck terror into the hearts
of slaveholders. A well-coordinated
uprising led by a large group of black
men resulted in the deaths of
approximately 55 white people, exposing
the vulnerability of the slave system
and the potential for organized
resistance. The aftermath of Turner&#39;s
rebellion led to heightened paranoia and
brutal reprisals against enslaved people
across the South. States enacted
stricter slave codes, further limiting
the freedoms and rights of enslaved
individuals. The uprising also
intensified the debate over slavery,
contributing to the growing divide
between pro-slavery and abolitionist
factions in the United States. Number
23. The East African slave trade
continued into the 20th century. While
the United States abolished the slave
trade in 1808, the East African slave
trade, also known as the Arab slave
trade, persisted for much longer.
Throughout the Indian Ocean region,
slavery was considered morally and
legally acceptable. Regardless of the
religious beliefs of those involved,
over a million slaves were taken from
East Africa during the 19th century, and
despite British efforts to suppress it,
the trade continued into the 20th
century. This highlights the global
nature of slavery and the fact that its
abolition was a gradual process with
some regions lagging far behind others
in eradicating this inhumane practice.
Number 24. The horrors of the Middle
Passage. The Middle Passage. A
nightmarish voyage across the Atlantic
Ocean was a living hell for those ins
snared in its clutches. Stolen from
their homeland and stripped of their
dignity. Men, women, and children alike
were crammed into the bowels of slave
ships. Their naked bodies shackled and
branded like cattle. The stench of human
waste and disease surrounded the air as
the captives endured unimaginable
suffering. Death became a constant
occurrence on this harrowing journey,
claiming the lives of an estimated 12%
of slaves. The brutality and despair
were so profound that they ignited
countless acts of rebellion, desperate
attempts to reclaim a semblance of
freedom, though these were often met
with swift and merciless reprisals.
Number 25, modern slavery. In our modern
world, slavery hasn&#39;t disappeared. It
simply changed its face. Instead of
chains and plantations, it hides in
plain sight as human trafficking, forced
labor, and forced marriage. Being
tricked, threatened, or even born into a
life where freedom is stolen and
exploited for someone else&#39;s profit.
This isn&#39;t a horror story from the past.
It&#39;s the chilling reality for an
estimated 49.6 6 million people today,
including a heartbreaking number of
children. Poverty, lack of education,
and social instability make certain
groups more vulnerable to these horrors.
Human trafficking, forced labor, and the
cruel practice of forced marriage,
modern slavery exists in various forms.
It&#39;s hidden within complex supply
chains, making it incredibly difficult
to hold businesses accountable. This is
why we need strong laws, government
action, and global cooperation to put a
spotlight on this darkness and protect
the vulnerable. In the UK, the National
Referral Mechanism is working tirelessly
to identify and support victims, proving
that the fight against modern slavery is
happening on our own doorsteps. But
let&#39;s not forget that this is a global
issue and we all have a role to play in
ensuring that every human being has the
right to live a life free from
exploitation. It&#39;s a fight for freedom,
dignity, and the fundamental values that
make us human. We&#39;ve just gone through
25 eye-opening facts about slavery. But
the commemoration must not end with this
video. May humanity continue to remember
those who fought against their chains.
For their stories are filled to the brim
with both pain and bravery as they
fought the neverending fight for
freedom. What we learn from these past
horrors and present-day injustices
should motivate us to take action. We
need to keep learning, raising
awareness, and actively fighting and put
a stop once and for all against the
exploitation that&#39;s still happening
around the world. It&#39;s our
responsibility to honor those who fought
for freedom before us, both the
abolitionists and the enslaved
themselves. By working together, we can
create a world where everyone is truly
free. Thank you for staying until the
