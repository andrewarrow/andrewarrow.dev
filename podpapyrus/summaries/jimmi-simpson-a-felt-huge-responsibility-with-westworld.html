Is there ever a character that&#39;s come
across your proverbial desk where you
were like, I don&#39;t know if I can. That
intimidates the out of me.
Yeah. I mean, um I I feel like I&#39;ve I
feel like I&#39;ve had that specific thought
and I&#39;m trying to think of of what it
was. I feel like it was um it was a few
years ago, you know, cuz my career
really began with uh mostly comedy.
Mhm. Um, and it probably wasn&#39;t until
like Westworld that that I started being
hired to not be funny on some level. Um,
yeah. Well, there was I mean there was a
there was a a a swagger to that
character, a sexiness to that character,
if you will, if I might be so bold.
um that um I think is that people may
have in the audience, maybe in the the
people that were hiring that allowed
them to potentially see you in a
different light because I know as a
viewer I did for the first time um where
at least in the work that I&#39;d seen you
in because I&#39;d always known you as as um
in comedy
um and your performance in Westworld was
very different that I&#39;d seen before. And
I I think that um it was just it was
very good. I mean, you always are, but
it was it was really
um different.
Yeah, it was. Well, it was um I honestly
felt I I wonder if you felt this way on
on on Battlestar. It it was just like
I all of a sudden um I&#39;m responsible to
tell major story.
Mhm. like I had never been my job was to
go and be like
and um and so it was a it was really a
huge undertaking to me that was like
film acting 101 for me because it was
repeated and it was those you know those
Westworld 18our days and all that stuff.
Um and it really tests your abilities to
the limit because now you&#39;re exhausted.
There&#39;s there&#39;s been no preparation.
It&#39;s just trying to process story
because it&#39;s your job and it has to be
good. And so it&#39;s that kind of like just
unpacking of yourself and you give
yourself over to the process. Um so so
yeah, it was uh it was such a it was
such a new experience for me to be able
to fall fully.
This episode is brought to you by
Masterclass.
I have been leaning into learning again
because between acting this podcast and
parenting, it is easy to feel like there
is no time for me. And I started
watching MasterClass in the mornings,
just one lesson at a time. And it is
actually changed the way that I approach
my work and my day. Because let&#39;s be
honest, as a parent, I&#39;m terrified I&#39;m
going to screw up my kids. I mean, I
know that I probably will and probably
not in the ways that I think that I
will, but one of the things that I love
right now is there is the science of
parenting right now. And the first
episode is called Your Burnout is Real.
It talks about how we are all burned out
and for good reason because the
expectations have never been higher. I
mean, we are literally raising little
tiny humans and it is so easy to feel
lost. One thing that always helps me are
the amazing mentors. Like I have learned
so much from Amy Polar with improv and
daily life. And there is Mindy Kalen&#39;s
class right now. Developing a singular
voice is wonderful. With MasterClass,
you can learn from the best to become
your best for as little as $10 a month.
Build annually. You get unlimited access
to over 200 classes taught by worldclass
actors, writers, leaders, chefs, more. I
mean, honestly, there&#39;s not much that
you could come up with that isn&#39;t on
MasterClass. The lessons are bite-sized
and easy to fit into even the busiest
schedule. So, I brought up Amy Polar.
For me, I loved the class on improv. It
reminded me just how playful and how
powerful play is and spontaneity in
life. I mean, these are things that we
can actually take into our parenting,
right? Right now, our listeners get an
additional 15% off any annual membership
at masterclass.com/katie.
That&#39;s 15% off at masterclass.com/katie.
masterclass.com/katie.
They&#39;re going to ask you where you
heard. You tell them that the Sackoff
Show sent you. Because if you want to
support the show, you might as well
learn something at the same time. Enjoy
master class.
Heat. Heat.
