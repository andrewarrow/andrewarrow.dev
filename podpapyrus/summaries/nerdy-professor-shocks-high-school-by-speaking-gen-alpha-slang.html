I was invited by this high school to
give a speech as a language expert about
the importance of learning languages.
But instead of just telling the students
why language matters, I decided to show
them. So I spent weeks secretly
mastering Gen Alpha slang and then
delivered the entire speech in their own
linguistic native tongue. Now I know
it&#39;s giving to Lulu for this choogy boo.
And to truly test my Gen Alpha fluency,
I brought the dialect to a college
graduation, delivering a formal
commencement speech in full professor
robes to a room full of future teachers.
Now they know exactly what they&#39;re up
against. But first, thanks to BetterHelp
for sponsoring this video. True story.
So, I&#39;m normally a pretty happy guy. I
love my career and my family. But late
last year, something just felt off. It
was like this weird knowing anxiety
creeping in. I&#39;d be filming, editing,
traveling, but underneath it all was
this pressure to constantly perform and
to always be on. And even though I&#39;m a
linguist, I wasn&#39;t even sure how to put
that into words. That&#39;s where today&#39;s
sponsor, BetterHel, came in. They&#39;re an
online platform that conveniently
connects you to a licensed therapist
wherever you are. Even if that&#39;s say in
the back of a tuk tuk in Bangkok. I
matched with a therapist in just a
couple days and from the very first
session, I felt like I was finally
learning how to talk about me, my
emotions, my fears, all the stuff that I
usually keep buried under the next plane
ticket. I spent several weeks with her
and honestly, I found myself tearing up
after our sessions because I got to talk
with her about things that I rarely get
to talk about with other people. And
over time, just like with all these
languages that I learned for my YouTube
channel, I started to get better at
expressing myself emotionally and
frankly just feeling better about my
life. When seasons change, I think it&#39;s
common to have a lot of anxiety around
new goals and projects and burdening
yourself with unrealistic expectations.
And so, if you&#39;re not feeling yourself
this spring, let BetterHelp help you
rule your anxiety so it doesn&#39;t rule
you. Click the link in the description
and just go to
betterhelp.com/yama to get 10% off your
first month of therapy. Now, back to the
video. Please join me and give a welcome
warm welcome to

our good morning everyone.
It&#39;s a true honor to be here at Westtown
High School for languages week. Your
school invited me to give a guest
lecture about the importance of learning
languages. But it occurred to me that
all of you are already in some sense
multilingual whether you realize it or
not. And that&#39;s because you speak the
Gen Alpha dialect of English. a a
language so distinct that I, an aging
34year-old millennial, genuinely cannot
understand it, or at least couldn&#39;t
understand it before I spent weeks
immersed in Tik Tok videos studying your
dialect to partial
fluency. And because nothing drives home
the importance of learning languages
better than hearing someone else try to
speak your own, I&#39;m going to try to
deliver the rest of this speech in your
very own native tongue. Jen Alpha.
[Applause]
wait, of course. Of course, to
facilitate the comprehension of my
fellow elders on YouTube watching this
as a video, I&#39;ll also be including
subtitles in standard
English. So, without further ado, it&#39;s
lowkey a huge W to be vibing here at
Westtown High School for Languages Week.
But chat, but chat, let&#39;s log in. We&#39;re
Prepare. Now, I know it&#39;s giving to Lulu
for this cheeky booer to speak in such
skiitty brain
rot, but if you&#39;ll bear with me, I&#39;ll
put the fries in the bag in just a
second. I do actually have a message
here. type
[Applause]
As I was saying, no cap, I was
dead assed about understanding this
language, but I had to absorb the drip
so I wouldn&#39;t get aired by your
generation. High key, people think Gen
Alpha slang is just memes and brain rot,
but on God, it&#39;s giving linguistic
glow-up core happening IRL.
Every time you drop a gat or it&#39;s
giving, you&#39;re legit patching the
English language DLC with fresh updates,
literally shifting the English
meta. Language evolves because you&#39;re
constantly cooking new ways to pass the
vibe check. And honestly, your memes
today f hit as the textbook vocab of
Bet. And this is exactly why learning
languages hits different. Just like how
your casual pooky talk could soon be the
dictionary definition, picking up
another language gives you front row
seats to how people around the world
give the
deets. It&#39;s like unlocking infinite
drip, allowing you to catch dubs across
cultures, connect deeper with the squad,
and stand new perspectives that would
otherwise leave you
ghosted. Languages aren&#39;t just sus
grammar rules, fam. They&#39;re the ultimate
rz for becoming a real one. everywhere
you pull up. It&#39;s the gigachad energy
me. So knowing languages isn&#39;t mid, but
it&#39;s not just a flex either. It&#39;s an
infinite money glitch that
slaps. People fin get pressed saying
languages are chopped or too hard. Don&#39;t
listen, bestie. They&#39;re just salty
because their language game is dog
Being multilingual is OD, letting you
stand cultures, vibe with international
fam, and utterly mog your career. No
cap, speaking another language lets you
go off, turning you into an absolute
conversational
wizard. So yeah, chat, that&#39;s the sauce.
Keep cooking, stay goated, never be mid,
and fr study hard and go ri up that
knowledge.
[Applause]
And thanks again to West Hound for
letting me do this. Y&#39;all are real ones.
When somebody&#39;s made a a really
important contribution to our field, we
honor you with basically a symbolic
doctorate. So, what we&#39;d like to do is
confer upon you the title of Dr. Sha.
How does that
sound? My colleague Dr. Ben is going to
confer with you. So, this is a doctoral
hood and this signifies that you&#39;re
getting there. So, stand here. All
right. So in recognition of your
contributions, we are conferring upon
you a symbolic doctorate. My colleague
Francis Troyan will place the doctorhood
Ari. Congratulations Dr.
Shelton. Good afternoon
everyone. It&#39;s such an honor to be here
today for Ohio State University&#39;s
multilingual language education
commencement. As graduates of this
program, you&#39;re coming out of one of the
country&#39;s most respected institutions as
true experts in the art and science of
language. How to learn it, how to teach
it, and how to use it to build bridges
cultures. But if you&#39;ll indulge me for a
moment, I do have one final test for you
language experts. No, it&#39;s not a
vocabulary quiz, nor is it a grammar
drill. It is rather a test of listening
comprehension in a language you may not
have formally studied, but one that your
future students are highly likely to
speak fluently. I&#39;m talking, of course,
about Gen
Alpha. Now, full disclosure, as an an
aging millennial myself, I am not a
native speaker, but I have actually been
studying this dialect for weeks with
real native speakers in order to attempt
to deliver the rest of my commencement
speech in
So, so in the spirit of meeting your
students where they are and celebrating
just how dynamic and fast evolving
language really is, I&#39;m going to give it
a shot. So, without further ado, yo,
chat, what&#39;s
good? First off, huge dub for me today.
Y&#39;all seriously got me in my main
era. Bro&#39;s out here getting an award for
multilingual riz.
Looks looks maxed out in this graduation
fit type
On God, I never thought I&#39;d be the
CEO of languages, but got here we are.
But but bear with me, Chad. I I promise
I&#39;m not just sing for Jenzi here. Let me
cook for a second because no cap,
there&#39;s actually a point
coming. So, I know some of you are
thinking, why even learn languages when
Google Translate exists? Well, fam, that
thing is just straight up Ohio coded.
You You ever tried using it in a real
conversation? Instant NPC behavior.
you will get cooked by a native speaker
and that&#39;s an L every
time. But actually learning languages is
highkey giving utterly immaculate vibes.
It&#39;s like mewing for your
brain. Like imagine you pull up to a new
country, order food in perfect brain rot
skippy slang and suddenly the locals are
stanning you. You just start to pull
aura points. No beta energy, just pure
Sigma Rizzler
vibes. And let&#39;s be real, nothing is
worse than getting ratioed for Ohio ass
translations. That&#39;s why you got to lock
in and actually learn the language. But
speaking another language isn&#39;t just
about flexing the drip. It&#39;s about
unlocking a whole new vibe. The culture,
the people, the stories, the valid sauce
that makes life richer. When you talk to
someone in their own language, you just
ate and left no crumbs. You feel
snatched just knowing you understand a
whole new world. So if you&#39;ve ever
thought about learning a new language,
this is your quest marker. Get roasted,
get humbled, take the L&#39;s, but keep
going and become the goat. That&#39;s how
you slay at this. Phantom tax that
knowledge. because your students may not
remember your worksheets, but they&#39;ll
never forget the day you spoke their
language. Thank you.
Thank you. All right, I think I&#39;m going
to have to ask my 15year-old for a
translation. He&#39;ll probably say, &#34;Dad,
don&#39;t touch grass.&#34;
There will be
subtitles. We also need subtitles. So we
