Welcome to the Michael Singer podcast
presented by Sounds True in partnership
with Shanti Publications. For more
information about Michael Singer&#39;s work,
access to all prior episodes, and
information about upcoming releases, we
invite you to join us at michaels
singingpodcast.com.
let&#39;s talk about something
very deep tonight. You can call it yoga,
but yoga is taught so many different
ways. There&#39;s so many different
philosophies and asas and gurus and this
Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s really going on
and bring it from the highest to the
lowest level and then work its way back
up. First of all, what&#39;s going on? And
science beautifully has some close so
close to getting to the core of yoga.
They may never make it actually there,
but they are so close. And it&#39;s really
beautiful that you live in a time with
the support of your exact sciences
support just within inches of the great
wisdom that the ancient rishies and the
uponads and these great texts tried to
teach you thousands thousands and
thousands of years ago.
The whole universe
is consciousness.
That&#39;s what it is. Consciousness is a
thing. It&#39;s an essence. That&#39;s like you
can go study the ocean. You talk about
the reefs and you can talk about the
fish, but there&#39;s the ocean, right? The
whole thing is the ocean. That&#39;s what it
is. Well, the whole universe, all of
matter, and you&#39;re going to see
everything else is made of
consciousness.
Well, do scientists know that? No.
They say very close that the omnipresent
universe everywhere,
all stars, all galaxies, all atoms,
every single thing in the universe
is a quantum field. It&#39;s a field. It&#39;s
not an object. It&#39;s not a pixel. It&#39;s
not a particle. There are no particles,
no atoms.
Not really. It&#39;s a field. There&#39;s just a
omnipresent field throughout the
universe. And when that field vibrates
and there&#39;s a vibration in that field, I
believe is a totally still lake.
Totally. As far as you can see, it&#39;s
just totally still like. There&#39;s no
vibrations. There&#39;s no interference.
There&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s just still.
That&#39;s the quantum field undisturbed.
There is no such thing. We&#39;ve never seen
such a thing because we can only see
what happens when it&#39;s disturbed. But we
know that there&#39;s a base state. They
there must be. All right. So what
happens when that field gets agitated?
They use that word that there&#39;s a
vibration of something that disturbs the
stillness of the field.
It makes wavelets. The same as a lake
would if you dropped a leaf in it or did
anything. Makes wavelets, doesn&#39;t it?
But there&#39;s a lot of things dropping in.
All right? So it&#39;s making lots of
wavelets and there are different
heights, there are different lows, there
are different amplitudes, vibrations and
speeds and all kinds of stuff. There&#39;s
wavelets can do that sort of thing.
Fine. The whole universe as you know it
is explained by quantum physics as that
that&#39;s what&#39;s there. But there&#39;s nothing
there. That&#39;s right. There&#39;s just we
notice that there are these wavelets and
what happens is the wavelets hit each
other and interact together and when
they interact they create apparent
qualities such as magnetism
and ultimately particles. But there are
no particles. It&#39;s just these wavelets
interacting together and behaving as
though they&#39;re a particle. That&#39;s where
protons and neutrons come from. They&#39;re
just these subatomic wavelets combining
together seemingly randomly. Like a
physicist will tell you, you cannot find
an electron. There&#39;s no such thing as an
electron. There are wavelets in a field
of which there are billions of them that
interact together. And there&#39;s a
probability that at this place there
will be something that behaves like what
we call electron. It behaves as it has a
negative charge. It moves a certain
speed. Just that&#39;s it. That is what is
explained to you with the deepest
physics that we have at this time. In
other words, nothing&#39;s really there.
Do you understand that? So I want to
talk about levels of vibrations. That&#39;s
the lowest level of vibration. This
thing&#39;s vibr at least in form. This
thing&#39;s vibrating. Well, where did this
come from? What? The pictures and the
people and the bodies and it came from
that. When did it do that? It&#39;s doing
that right now. There is just this field
of we&#39;ll call it energy. This field of
energy that does not form, but it it
when it wavelets and is agitated, it has
certain properties. They call it spin
and colors. I I don&#39;t want to get into
it. I can&#39;t. It&#39;s very complex. Of
course, it&#39;s complex. How do you make
this out of that? That is what they&#39;re
explaining in quantum physics. That is
what they&#39;re explaining. How out of
nothing? That is little wavelets. They
can build and they can they can build
everything. All the atoms, all the
molecules, DNA. What is DNA? There&#39;s no
such thing. There&#39;s just these wavelets.
Well, where&#39; the data come from? From
them. There&#39;s nothing. Where&#39;d your body
come from? There is nothing. There&#39;s
just these wavelets interacting
together, trillions and billions and
zillions of them all over the universe
interacting together and they interact
in such a way that it makes electron
neutron and protons and then molecules
and then DNA and all of it just and then
there&#39;s this.
It&#39;s very important to understand what&#39;s
going on. Why? For one thing, how can
you be neurotic about this? It&#39;s not
even here.
Oh, look. He got old. What does that
mean? the the wavelengths don&#39;t get old.
You have to really do a lot of science
to understand how that one field, the
quantum field of energies interacting
together end up making all of this. And
and you can explain lots of I don&#39;t want
to get into it. There&#39;s nothing wrong
with you getting into it at that level
though. All right? At just a very very
high level to sit there and say things
like, &#34;Well, what&#39;s color?
Do those have color?&#34; Well, no, not
really. But, and I&#39;m not going to get
into it. Go check it out. Where&#39;s color
coming from? There is no color. The
universe has no color. But there&#39;s
light. There&#39;s photons. Those are part
of what that quantum field emanates.
It&#39;s photons. And those photons have
properties. And they vibrate at
different levels called the
electromagnetic spectrum. And that&#39;s
what I want to talk about. We&#39;ll call it
energy. They don&#39;t call it energy. They
just call it the quantum field,
whatever. But that some of them call it
energy. Vibrates at different rates.
What do you mean? Ice vibrates very
Water vibrates faster.
Vapor vibrates faster. They&#39;re all H2O
molecules. There&#39;s absolutely no
difference in ice, water, and steam. The
only difference is how fast they&#39;re
moving amongst each other. But the same
thing is true the entire quantum field.
It vibrates at different rates. The
slower it vibrates, the more gross it
is. The more it behaves like form, you
can start seeing it and so on so forth.
The faster it vibrates like light,
highest vibration rates and then
everything in between. Like yoga told
you and science is very close. The
entire universe is made of that. It&#39;s
made of call it energy vibrating at
different rates and depending upon what
rate it&#39;s vibrating at, it manifests as
things different. For example, we&#39;ve
talked about form. Okay, fine, enough.
There&#39;s form. Here it is. Have fun. What
about your thoughts?
Do you have thoughts? I should be a
scientist. Do you have thoughts? Of
course you have thoughts. How do you
Dare to ask the deep questions. Don&#39;t
assume you have thoughts because you
have thoughts in your What is a thought?
Where did it come from? Is it made of
the quantum field? What is a thought?
What is an emotion? How do you know you
have thoughts and emotions? Where are
they? These are legitimate questions and
they all have the same answer when it
comes down to it. There is a field of
energy deeper than the quantum field,
right? It is called consciousness. God,
consciousness, universal awareness, call
whatever you want. And it is still. It
is unmanifest. It is just there. What
does that mean? It means it knows that
it knows that it knows but there are no
objects of consciousness. There&#39;s just
imagine pure awareness. It&#39;s not aware
of anything.
It&#39;s just has this quality called
awareness which kind of magical that it
knows that it knows that it knows
everything else is vibrating at a slower
rate. That&#39;s called creation. Vibrates
at a slower rate. consciousness slows
itself down. We&#39;ll talk about how it
does that in a moment. Slows itself down
and every single tiny nano movement of a
slower vibration creates another field
of creation. And your mental plane is a
higher vibration rate than the quantum
field. The quantum field is physical. It
manifests the physical field, electron,
neutron, protons, etc., etc., photons,
and so on. It ends up manifesting those.
Well, there&#39;s a higher vibration rate
than that. Ultimately, the highest
vibration rate that we want to be
spiritual, the highest vibration rate is
so high that it&#39;s not moving. It&#39;s
beyond it&#39;s the speed of light. That&#39;s
what&#39;s going. It&#39;s everywhere at once at
the same time. Your consciousness in
your body can be in the toe and on your
nose at the same time. Can you be aware
of your toe and your nose at the same
time? How long did it take to move
between your toe and your nose? Nothing.
Why? They are at the same place at the
same time. They are simultaneously
present. Your entire body is that way.
You can feel your body. It doesn&#39;t take
movement to go from one end to the
other. That is what the universe is. is
one undifferentiated
non-dual field of consciousness that is
aware of itself everywhere at the same
time at the same time simultaneously and
it&#39;s aware that it&#39;s aware but it&#39;s not
doing anything. It&#39;s just there. That&#39;s
called the unmanifest. That&#39;s the
starting position of creation.
Genesis tries to do it. In the beginning
was darkness upon the earth and then
there was light and God looked and it
was good. In other words, it came from
nothing and it&#39;s just there. So the
beginning position is consciousness.
It&#39;s a very important thing to know
because we&#39;re going to talk about you a
little later. How does this have to do
with you? Like I dare you. What is
consciousness? Is this thing conscious
that it&#39;s there?
Is your body conscious that it&#39;s there
or are you conscious of your body? Are
your thoughts conscious that they&#39;re
talking to you or are you conscious that
they&#39;re talking to you? Consciousness is
this thing called awareness. There&#39;s no
words that can touch it. So great.
Without consciousness, without
awareness, what is the purpose of
anything? Let&#39;s say everything exists
but nothing is ever conscious of it.
Talk to me about it. It might as well
not exist. Maybe it doesn&#39;t. Nobody
knows. Nothing knows. So consciousness
is the foundation of the meaning of
existence of creation that there is
awareness. What&#39;s it aware of? Okay, now
you start creating objects of
consciousness. Where do they come from?
They are the exact same consciousness
at a slower rate and therefore it can
look at itself. If H2O is conscious, it
could become ice and see itself as water
and have float on top of itself. So
consciousness though it&#39;s one and will
never be different just because it
vibrates at different rates can
experience itself at different levels.
It&#39;s not complicated in truth if you
stop thinking about it. It&#39;s very
simple. In the lake which is totally
still there&#39;s no differentiation.
Vibrate all kinds of differentiations.
Is there really or is it just the lake?
There&#39;s nothing happening there. It&#39;s
just a field of energy vibrating. And
because it vibrates at different rates,
it makes different objects. It makes
grosser and grosser and subtler and
subtler things. So your mental plane is
a very very subtle vibration rate of
this I&#39;ll call it energy of this
conscious energy. Yoga they call it
chitaki conscious energy. That vibration
is mental plane. Then there&#39;s an
emotional plane. Your emotions are not
the same as your thoughts. Your thoughts
talk to you. Your thoughts can
visualize. Your emotions can&#39;t do that.
You feel your emotions. You call them
feelings. Don&#39;t you pay attention.
You&#39;re in there. You&#39;re conscious. So, I
get to talk to you like this because
you&#39;re a conscious being. And all I&#39;m
talking to you about is what you&#39;re
conscious of. But you don&#39;t pay
attention to it. And I&#39;ll show you why
later. But right now, you are the
example of the fact that there are
different planes of reality which are
not planes of reality. They&#39;re just
different vibration rates of this
universal energy of this conscious
energy. So, we&#39;ll stay down on the human
plane. You have thoughts. You have
emotions and you experience them and you
know you do. If some scientist tells you
you don&#39;t have thoughts, show them to
me. Think of an apple. You&#39;re lying.
Show me. You can&#39;t because they don&#39;t
exist on this plane. But you know they
exist, don&#39;t you? At some point if they
tell you you don&#39;t have any thoughts,
how about you&#39;re making it up. What does
that mean? It&#39;s a figment of your
imagination. Where&#39;s that? Don&#39;t let
them trick you. The fact that it exists
anywhere. It exists. You made it up.
What does that mean? What they mean by
that is you have a mind that I can&#39;t
see. They can&#39;t see. And you can make up
things, but I don&#39;t believe you. I know.
I did. I saw the apple. I saw the
person. I saw the field. I had a dream.
Do you have dreams? How do you know?
Where are they? They don&#39;t exist. Of
course they exist. You see them. You
talk about them. You come back and they
bother you. They exist just as much as
the real world exists. Except other
people can&#39;t see them. Why? Because
they&#39;re at a higher vibration rate than
what can be picked up on the physical
plane by your physical senses. They used
to define the physical world by that
which could be picked up by their
instruments. That did not include
ultraviolet or infrared. Their
instruments they didn&#39;t know they
existed. They didn&#39;t know there were
radio waves. Therefore, they didn&#39;t
exist. Of course they did. They just
didn&#39;t have the ability to picked it up
with their instruments. Then they gained
the ability to pick it up. What did they
do? Say it&#39;s from a higher plane. No,
they brought it down here. Yes, you&#39;re
right. Ultraviolet&#39;s on this plane also.
The entire spectrum is but not thoughts.
No, they&#39;re not on the spectrum. They
are so they&#39;re just at a higher
vibration rate of the electromagnetic
spectrum than what we are capable of
picking up with their instruments.
Someday they will read your thoughts. I
don&#39;t want to be here.
Do you understand that? They try.
They&#39;ve been trying for a long time.
They all kinds of stuff, but they&#39;re not
there yet. But someday they will get
there. So all it is is one field of
consciousness
vibrating at different rates. And so
when it slows down enough, so it&#39;s not
just pure consciousness, it manifests as
the mental plane. And it can create
anything it wants in the mental plane,
then the emotional plane, then the
physical plane. All of these things
exist in the same place at the same
time. You say, &#34;How can that happen?&#34;
the same way that water and ice and
steam can exist in the same thing at the
same time interact with each other. So
here you are dealing with all of this.
But now we come down to you for a
minute. What do you have to do with this
one? I said it was consciousness. Are
you conscious?
Yeah. How do you know? I am that I am.
How&#39;s that? I know that I know. Okay,
great. So you are pure consciousness.
You are the conscious. Can you see your
Can you stop a thought? Can you push it
away? Can you cling to it? Can you
change its shape? Can you change what
it&#39;s saying? You&#39;re in there and you
have this power called will. That&#39;s the
power that created the universe. It&#39;s
the power that consciousness has. Do you
have will? Can you make a thought come?
Can you make a thought go? Can you make
your arm move? Do you have will in there
that can make things happen? Of course
you do. What is will? Concentrated
consciousness. I repeat that to you.
Will is a force. It&#39;s not one of the
fundamental forces, but it&#39;s obviously
there. I can make things happen all by
myself. If you concentrate
consciousness, it creates a power and
that power is will. So if you want to
hold on to a thought, you need to
concentrate, don&#39;t you? Okay, you say it
so naturally. I can&#39;t concentrate as
well as I used to. What does that mean?
It means I can&#39;t focus the consciousness
enough to hold on to the object. My
husband died some years ago and I little
by little can&#39;t visualize him. I used to
be able to. Why? Because you can&#39;t focus
your consciousness enough to create in
your mind the image that you used to be
able to do. And math does that too,
doesn&#39;t it? Sometimes you can&#39;t focus
enough. That&#39;s what will is. The power
of focused consciousness. All right,
fine. So, you&#39;re in there. You&#39;re
conscious and you have will. Do you have
thoughts? Yes. Do you have emotions?
Yes. Do you have a body? Yes. Is there
an outside world that you can pick up?
Yes. Here we are. All of it vibrating at
different rates and your consciousness
interacts with all of it. Okay. Why
would we talk about such a thing? And
what&#39;s it got to do with spirituality
and yoga? How about everything? Do you
have control of your thoughts? Watch
before you answer. Do you have control
of your thoughts? Well, you can say I
should. Potentially, I do. They&#39;re my
thoughts. Not somebody else&#39;s. Do you
have control over whether your house is
clean or not? Not really. I&#39;m a
No, you have control. You&#39;re just not
doing it. Do you have control of your
Oh, it&#39;s a big one, isn&#39;t it?
Potentially.
Something happened. Somebody says
something not nice to you. An emotion
came up that hurt you. Do you have to
get lost in it? Do you have to hold them
responsible for it? Do you have to carry
it on for the rest of your life and
blame the person? Or can you let it go?
Potentially, you have the abu to let it
go. How do I know? Person say, &#34;I am so
sorry that I said that to you. I swear
I&#39;ll never say.&#34; Okay.
What happened? You let it go. Why? Cuz
you chose to. I ain&#39;t letting it go cuz
you chose not to. Will. Look how deep
we&#39;re talking. That&#39;s why they talk to
you about intent. They&#39;re talking about
will, talking about commitment, talk to
about discipline. All of that stuff is
the same thing. You&#39;re in there and you
are consciousness and consciousness is
God. Consciousness is the quality of
awareness of being. When Moses was
talking to the burning bush and the
burning bush told him, &#34;Go down to the
Pharaoh and let my people go.&#34; And Moses
said, &#34;What is the name of the god I
should do it in?&#34; Because they had lots
of gods and goddesses down there in
Egypt, right? What name should I tell
the Pharaoh that has the authority to
tell you this? What did he say? I am
that I am.
What does that mean? You are that you
are. How do you know you&#39;re in there?
Because I am. So that state of being,
pure consciousness that knows that it
knows that it knows
is God is the creator of the universe.
Well, why don&#39;t I experience that? Okay,
we&#39;re getting there very quickly. Why
don&#39;t experience I like being God.
That sounds like a lot of fun. That
sounds like fun. Why can&#39;t I know that
I&#39;m God? Because your consciousness
which is that field of consciousness
that is unmanifest and at the same time
manifest. Just like the lake is still
and is rippled and it&#39;s ice. It&#39;s all at
the same time and you are that your
consciousness is that there&#39;s only one
consciousness in the universe. That&#39;s
what it is consciousness. Well, why
don&#39;t I experience that? Because the
objects of consciousness, your thoughts,
your emotions,
distract your consciousness.
Do you not get distracted by your
thoughts? Do you sit there and say, &#34;I
can&#39;t. I&#39;m distracted. I&#39;m so
distracted.&#34; Who&#39;s distracted by what?
You do get distracted, don&#39;t you? You
get distracted by what? There&#39;s an
object that came in either my mind or
through my senses and it drew my
consciousness away from the seed of
consciousness from where I&#39;m I&#39;m just
conscious. Whatever is happening, I&#39;m
just aware. I got pulled down. In other
words, concentrated on something outside
of my consciousness, an object of
consciousness. A thought caught my
attention, didn&#39;t it? A feeling. I got
lost in my feelings. who got lost in
what? I was here doing really well until
you said that. Now I&#39;m down there in the
hurricane and you&#39;re going to pay for
this and I ain&#39;t here anymore. I&#39;m not
centered. I don&#39;t have clarity. I&#39;m
upset. Okay. What does that mean? It
means your conscious is still conscious.
Otherwise, you&#39;re going to know you&#39;re
upset. It&#39;s what you&#39;re conscious of
that matters. in the deep yogic states
where the deep ones went to the deepest
samadis they were conscious of being
conscious nothing else it was completely
still I&#39;m keep mixing these levels
together because it&#39;s fun in the deep
yoga there&#39;s two levels of samadei which
probably plenty but two that you talk
about sabi kalpa and nearby kalpa first
what&#39;s samadei you&#39;re out you&#39;re not
being distracted by your senses you&#39;re
not being distracted by your thoughts
you&#39;re not being distracted you went
deep in meditation you&#39;re not being
distracted by your emotions, not you&#39;re
fighting with them, not you&#39;re trying
not to be distracted, not you push them
down so you can stick your head up, then
you&#39;re still distracted by them, aren&#39;t
you? You&#39;re not distracted by them.
They&#39;re like the white lines on the
road. You drive right by. You don&#39;t pay
as much attention to them. You&#39;re not
distracted. They didn&#39;t pull your
consciousness down toward them. So, when
it does that, you get caught in your
thoughts and emotions and personality
and ego and all that garbage. What if
you don&#39;t What if you go deep enough
into meditation to where there&#39;s just
stillness and nothing is distracting
your consciousness down to these lower
objects of consciousness. But use those
words. You got it. Consciousness and
objects of consciousness. Your thoughts
are objects of conscious, aren&#39;t they?
They can be high, they can be low, they
can be good, they can be bad, they can
dirty, X-rated, Yrated, Rr rated, PC,
PG, who cares? They&#39;re just thoughts and
your consciousness is distracted by
them. or isn&#39;t distracted by them. I
want to talk about we know what it&#39;s
like to be distracted by them. Now I&#39;m
talking about what would happen if you
weren&#39;t distracted by them. Then the
sensors go about their business, but
you&#39;re not distracted by it. A yogi, a
true yogi can sit there with their eyes
completely open and not see anything.
You do it all the time. You get lost in
thought. You don&#39;t listen to me. Can you
get lost in thought and not pay
attention to what&#39;s here? You&#39;re reading
a book. You&#39;re reading a book. Turning
the pages. All of a sudden, you realize
I didn&#39;t read a thing.
I better go back. I looked at it, but I
none of it got in there. Why? Because I
was busy being distracted by other
thoughts. Now, you get it. There are all
these different objects to be distracted
by. What if you&#39;re not?
That&#39;s the depth of yoga. What if you&#39;re
not distracted by the outside world? Not
that it&#39;s not there, not that you
suppress it, not that you have to fight
with it. You&#39;re just that interested.
You&#39;re not distracted by it. The truth I
once told you, you are 99% enlightened.
Every one of you. 99% of every single
thing that ever came in through your
senses did not distract you. Every tree
you drove by, every cloud that went by,
every wind that blew by, every person
that walked by, how many things go in
there that you&#39;re not distracted by?
You&#39;d be busy your whole life. You&#39;re
able to not be distracted. A great yogi
who meditates deeply is just not
distracted. I don&#39;t want you to think
they&#39;re fighting or struggling or
suppressing or working with themselves.
They&#39;re not distracted. They&#39;re not
distracted by it. Then the thoughts,
they&#39;re not distracted by their
thoughts. They don&#39;t have to change
their thoughts. They have to say
mantras. They don&#39;t do anything. They&#39;re
not distracted by the mental plane, by
the entire vibration of the mental
plane. They&#39;re not distracted by the
emotional plane. What are they
distracted by? Nothing. Well, if you&#39;re
not distracted
from where you get distracted from
something, that&#39;s called your seat of
consciousness, your center, the cord of
your being, the self. You&#39;re seated in
the self, and you&#39;re not being
distracted. Well, what happens? You feel
peace. You feel the nature of the self,
which they say is such an eternal
conscious ecstasy. That is your natural
state. That&#39;s the natural state of your
being. there now you&#39;re there you&#39;re
starting to enter into states that the
yogis call samadei all right well master
yoga talked about sabi kalpa samati what
does that mean he went into a state
where when he wasn&#39;t distracted at all
by his lower self at any level he merged
with the universe what do you mean he
returned to the quantum field he
returned to the field of consciousness
that was everywhere all the time he said
he felt it was every galaxy spreading at
the speed of light in all directions.
That was his body. So that&#39;s called
samadei with form. He&#39;s experiencing
form, but it ain&#39;t down here. It&#39;s kind
of like feeling the nature of
consciousness. Then there&#39;s nearby
samadei. Ah, now you&#39;re talking high
stuff where the great ones, truly great
ones, went what? You went past form. You
went back into the state of
consciousness before creation was
It is in the nondual formless state. And
there&#39;s complete peace and complete
well-being. Now, why am I talking about
this? This is who you are. There&#39;s
nothing I&#39;m talking about that&#39;s who
they are. You&#39;re the same consciousness.
Period. You&#39;re the exact same
consciousness. What Christ tried to tell
you, as I sit by the throne of my
father, that&#39;s a state of consciousness.
As I sit by the throne of my father, so
you shall sit by my throne. and these
things which I do, you should do these
and even greater things. In other words,
tagger it. Why don&#39;t experience it? I
told you because consciousness has every
vibration. It&#39;s all there. And you&#39;re
being distracted all the time by the
vibration of your thoughts, your
emotions, your body, and what&#39;s coming
in through your senses. And you say
that&#39;s who you are. It&#39;s not who you
are. It&#39;s what you&#39;re being distracted
by and therefore defining yourself as.
It&#39;s called your self-concept.
You made up a you. Now we&#39;re to the
level I always talk to you about, but I
created the whole universe to do it.
You&#39;re saying that&#39;s God didn&#39;t go away.
He just focused
the ray of consciousness on your
thoughts, your emotions, your body. It
was coming through your senses. That&#39;s
what&#39;s happening. And because you&#39;re
always staring at them, you identify
with them. And you say this is who I am.
I&#39;m a 52 year old woman and this is what
happened to me and I grew up over here
and these are my parents. Hello.
You are the consciousness staring at
that collection of thoughts, that
collection of emotions, that particular
body which keeps changing. I don&#39;t know
how you keep identifying with other
things. Were you in there yesterday?
Were you in there last year? Were you
aware of thoughts last year? How about
when you were 10 years old? Did you look
in the mirror? Did you look like that?
No, he looked like a 10-year-old. Who&#39;s
looking? Who has the continuity of
consciousness that knows it was you
looking at the thing? It should have
looked different, didn&#39;t it?
Have your thoughts changed since you
were 12. How do you know?
Cuz you&#39;re in there. Yes, you can have
memory what they were, but you know they
were there. You know, you played with
your thoughts. So, your consciousness
doesn&#39;t change. What you&#39;re conscious of
changes. But I&#39;ve already said to you,
everything you&#39;re conscious of is just a
different vibration rate of
consciousness
there. If you got that, you&#39;re getting
the big stuff. It&#39;s just it vibrates at
different levels and then it captures
your awareness and you become this
human. You are not a human being. your
God consciousness distracted by the
collection of thoughts and emotions and
body and outside world that&#39;s coming in
through this one tiny I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve
been teaching lately how tiny you are
how tiny is that stupid thing you&#39;re
paying attention to psychology says man
is the sum of learned experiences it&#39;s
not true you&#39;re the consciousness that&#39;s
aware that yep I picked up this stuff
throughout my life so I believe the way
I do and think the way I do and act the
way I do some learned experience says,
&#34;But I&#39;m the consciousness that&#39;s paying
attention to that.&#34; So, it&#39;s not truly
that you&#39;re just learned experiences.
You&#39;re the conscious awareness that is
addicted, distracted constantly by what
you picked up in your mind throughout
your life. That&#39;s why you believe what
you believe. If you had a different
experiences, you believe something
different. You can change your core
beliefs in one minute. Just fall in love
with somebody else. Or have somebody
tell you, &#34;I&#39;m leaving you. I can&#39;t
believe you did that. Okay, I&#39;ll never
do it again. I promise you I don&#39;t have
to be like this. How do you want me to
be? What does that prove? You&#39;re not who
you said you were. It&#39;s made them up.
Okay. So, you are staring at this
collection and I I&#39;ll just do it. It
doesn&#39;t take too long. I want to show
how ridiculous it is. So, the collection
of experiences that you picked up in
your life every single moment. I I stop
myself all the time. I say, &#34;Well, I&#39;m
here looking at this. I&#39;m looking I&#39;m
there looking at something.&#34; All right.
I&#39;m there experiencing something. Does
that mean I&#39;m not somewhere else? How
many else&#39;s are there? How many else&#39;s
places could I be looking at? 700
billion zillion. I just happen to be
looking at that one, then that one, then
that one, then that one, then that one.
Sew them together and you got nothing.
You think you got something. You got
nothing. You missed everything. What is
the ratio between what you experienced
every moment versus what you missed
every moment? What else was going on?
You could have just as well experienced
that. And that&#39;s when you understand now
you&#39;re touching reality. Now it&#39;s why I
want to talk to I talk to right you look
at that say
if I tell you you&#39;re nothing. Don&#39;t get
embarrassed. Of course you&#39;re nothing.
Your ego is nothing. Your self-concept
is nothing. The thoughts you picked up
over the course of your life are 0.00 oh
1% of what&#39;s going on. And the mind
would think completely different. The
emotion would be completely different if
you had picked up different experiences.
and you know it, even admit it. So, I&#39;m
just trying to tell you the ratio
between what you experienced and what
you missed is not even funny. And that
helps you spiritually tremendously. And
stop paying so much attention to the
stupid stuff you&#39;re doing in your mind
because it&#39;s meaningless. If it could
change that quickly, if it got formed
because of this arbitrary, it rained on
your birthday when you were five. I hate
the rain. I want to live in Arizona.
That talking thing going on in your head
is the sum of your learned experiences.
I love that they said that. But they
will tell you and your learned
experiences are nothing. But I watched a
movie and it really made a big
impression on me. How many movies did
you not watch? What if you had eaten
something bad the night before and your
stomach hurt tremendously? So you were
distracted and couldn&#39;t watch the movie
too good. Did it have a big impact on
you? Every little thing determined the
nothing that&#39;s going on in there. But
you want to think that it matters what&#39;s
going on in there. He looked like my
brother and I called out to him and he
didn&#39;t even say hello.
He probably wasn&#39;t my brother, but he
looked like him. What are you doing?
Just making up all this garbage inside
your head, causing yourself problems and
getting yourself upset. That&#39;s what a
human is. You don&#39;t want to be one.
Especially since you&#39;re not. You&#39;re the
awareness, the consciousness, the same
consciousness, not the same
consciousness that created the heaven
and earth. The same consciousness that
is creating the heaven and earth. The
consciousness is manifest in the quantum
field is your consciousness. Well, why
don&#39;t I know that? Because you&#39;re being
distracted by this collection of
thoughts you picked up and emotions and
you think they&#39;re all so important.
That&#39;s why you&#39;re not even interested in
the quantum field. Most people don&#39;t.
Oh, that&#39;s interesting. All right.
Right. So, the world is not what you
think it is. Your awareness is not what
think it is. Your ego is absurd thing to
have. This is who I am. Who the person
who played Dorothy in the fifth grade
and the person who married so and so and
then we got divorced. Who are you if it
didn&#39;t happen? I don&#39;t know. Maybe I
don&#39;t exist. Of course you exist. You
just have different experiences. If I
could ever talk to you enough to get to
the point where you feel it doesn&#39;t
matter what experiences I had. They just
coming and going. They were there one
minute and gone the next, but I held
them on inside my head and built a whole
self-concept based on what happened to
me. What a dumb thing to do, right? Why
can&#39;t I just Here I am. I dropped down
to the planet Earth. I&#39;ll be here for a
few years. Bye-bye. Where&#39;d I come from?
I don&#39;t know where I end up. I don&#39;t
know. I&#39;ll find out. But I&#39;m going to
have a good old time. I&#39;m going sit down
here and get neurotic and worry about
what everybody thinks of me and what
they said and what happens to me and how
much money did I have and what I look
like when I&#39;m young or when I&#39;m old. I
don&#39;t want to look any different. What
are you doing? You just dropped down on
the planet. You have these experiences
and you just have fun. Enjoy yourself.
And we&#39;ll talk about that in a minute.
Why can&#39;t you do that? Because you
couldn&#39;t handle the moments that
happened to you. Mommy, he did this and
Freud found out that daddy did this and
this happened and that happened and
first boyfriend. That one&#39;s so good. And
this happened and that happened, right?
And the car that you first kissed in,
right? You saw one driving down the
highway the other day and it made you
cry. What were you doing? That was 30
years ago.
Tell me you don&#39;t do that. That&#39;s why
it&#39;s a mess.
The world is unfolding everywhere.
I try to teach you. You just happen to
be standing in a particular place to
have a particular experience. It ain&#39;t
Turn to the left. You find a different
one. What if somebody disses you, but
you&#39;re not listening? Didn&#39;t bother you
at all. What are you doing? You&#39;re
taking this all seriously. Just a moment
passed in front of you. It could have
not passed. It could have it could
anything. You could have not paid
attention. Then you sat there and held
on to it and built this concept of
yourself inside your head which isn&#39;t
even there. You just made it out of
these vibration rates. How would you
hold on to the fact that what he said
you&#39;ll never forget it. You concentrated
on it. I am not going to forget what you
said to me. Don&#39;t you worry. I will
never for what are you doing? You&#39;re
concentrating your consciousness on that
particular thing. Therefore, it stays.
And that&#39;s what your ego is. your
self-concept, that which you defined
yourself as, that which you define
yourself as is not who you are. You&#39;re
the one who did it. You&#39;re the one who
decided to define yourself as something.
So the great ones, they didn&#39;t do that
or they worked their way through it. So
they&#39;re not bothered by their mind now.
Well, why? Because they&#39;re not bothered
by their mind now. They understand that
the world is here and it&#39;s unfolding
everywhere and what happened to me is
meaningless. Oh, I love it. If you could
do that. All right. I was sitting there
driving down the road and I parked my
car and someone stole the thing. All
right. What&#39;d you do? Call the police.
It was fun. Did they find it? No. What
do you do? I walk.
Who cares? All right. Okay. So, now
we&#39;ve got ourselves creation&#39;s created.
God is God. But it got distracted.
That&#39;s the fall from the garden. I&#39;m
telling you, the fact that your
consciousness got distracted
by this personal thing was called the
tree of self-nowledge.
It got distracted by you and now you&#39;re
busy being you and you have to work by
the sweat of your brow to be okay. Oh,
it&#39;s there&#39;s deep stuff in there. So,
basically, here you are. Now, what what
has this got to do with what&#39;s going on?
You&#39;re caught in yourself. You&#39;re caught
in this tiny little thing on the planet
Earth with everything else going on, not
to you. Only what you collected that is
bothering you. And now you define the
purpose of your life. Let&#39;s go a little
slower. I wanted to get there. Right.
What do you now do with your life?
Because I know what you&#39;re doing. I
don&#39;t even have to know you. You have
things inside of you that you held on to
that are disturbing.
and you don&#39;t want it to happen again.
And you have things inside of you, not
many, that are inspiring, encouraging,
that look like to be fun. And guess
what? You want them to happen. So,
you&#39;ve now devoted your life
to collecting experiences out of random,
whatever it is. Some of which bothered
you, most of which bothered you, by the
way, but some of which inspired you. And
now you devoted your life to saying, &#34;I
want the outside world to unfold in
front of me the way I want it to.&#34; Wow.
I just told you the outside world came
from. It&#39;s the quantum field vibrating
up and manifesting creation. And
everybody else&#39;s thoughts are the sum of
their learned experiences. You don&#39;t
know a thing about them. And you want
the moments unfolding in front of you to
be the way you decide you want them to
be based on your experiences. And I&#39;ll
bet you&#39;re having trouble.
I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re having trouble. I bet
sometimes you get disappointed. I bet
sometimes you&#39;re scared that you lose
what you want or that it won&#39;t happen
what you want or that you&#39;ll have to get
what you don&#39;t. Anybody worry? Does
anybody know what the word worry means?
You know what it means? Is I made up how
I wanted to be and it might not be that
way. Isn&#39;t that what worrying is? I made
up in my mind which was made up of my
little experiences which were nothing
compared to everything else. I call them
statistically insignificant.
And I made up with that how I want the
moments to unfold in front of me. And if
they do, I&#39;m a happy camper for a while
at least. And if they don&#39;t, I can get
depressed. Nothing will be the way I
want. I can&#39;t handle it. I can get
really dark and I can have all kinds of
problems and I can never be totally open
because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to
happen. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to
happen. But I have lots of money. Have
we noticed a lot of people have a lot of
money and don&#39;t get everything the way
they want? Who&#39;s noticed that yet? Or
power or anything else? Listen to me.
There&#39;s nothing you are going to do that
will make every moment unfolding in
front of you be the way you decided you
wanted it to be. Okay. So now you get to
spirituality.
That&#39;s what Buddha taught you. Buddha&#39;s
noble truth. All life is suffering.
What&#39;s the cause of suffering? You have
a way you want it to be. He used the
word desire. The cause of all suffering
is that you have a way you want it to
be. In other words, a desire. What is a
desire? A way you want it to be. The
need, if you have a way you want it to
be, you&#39;re going to suffer. Why? What is
the probability that the quantum field
is going to manifest from down there,
putting everything together, creating
all of universe up here based on the
laws of chemistry and physics and
psychology and everything. And the
moment in front of you, which is one of
700 billion zillion, is going to be the
way your mind made up it wants it to be.
Give me the probability. How about zero?
But I have hope. I&#39;ll bet you do.
That&#39;s why we suffer. And that&#39;s why
this plane is not a very high plane
because you got 8.3 billion people
having had totally different experiences
throughout their life. Making up what
they want and what they don&#39;t want and
then making up with their beautiful
intellectual mind how to manipulate
everybody else and everything else to
make the moments be what I want them to
be. Well, I wonder why there are wars. I
wonder why there&#39;s disharmony. I wonder
why it&#39;s so hard. everything. A
relationship is hard. Of course, it&#39;s
hard. It&#39;s not going to be the way you
made up you want it to be. Why? Why
should it be? The person next to you
doesn&#39;t want it that way, do they? Who
wins? Spirituality is about taking this
entire That&#39;s why I started the whole
way. You understood the quantum field
that vibrates and manifest atoms and
molecules and they all put themselves
together and they make everything. And
you&#39;re going to decide how the one in
front of you is going to be or makes it
a little easier for you to understand.
Every person that you interact with,
every person that you interact with is
the sum of their learned experiences.
Not the sum of your learned experiences,
but you want it to be. You want it to
your way, don&#39;t you? And you get upset
when they don&#39;t. You not only get upset,
you say they&#39;re wrong. You should not
have said that. I can&#39;t believe you said
that. I would never have said that. Of
course not. You did not have the
person&#39;s experiences. You did not have
those impressions. I told you I wanted
to have a deep talk. Can you understand
what I&#39;m trying to get across to you? No
wonder it&#39;s a mess. No wonder
everybody&#39;s suffering.
What is spiritual? What are you doing
holding on to past experiences and
defining what life&#39;s supposed to be now
in relationship to those experiences?
I had a really good time when I dated
this person in 10th grade and now I all
I know is pretty much I&#39;m looking for
the same person. I they look the same
but really the same qualities and the
things I liked about them and the
different traits. You stored this stuff
inside and now you&#39;re trying to make the
outside world match what you like and
not match what you don&#39;t like and that&#39;s
what everybody&#39;s doing and it doesn&#39;t
work. It doesn&#39;t work. Of course it
doesn&#39;t work. How can the outside world
match what you want? What is a desire?
You feel desires. A desire is an energy
inside of you that&#39;s trying to get out.
You feel it. It&#39;s like an impulse that&#39;s
pushing towards something. Why is it
doing that? Because you stored it inside
of you. You blocked it. This event
happened and you felt good and then this
person left you. And now you want to
have it flow again. You want to feel the
energy. It&#39;s all energy. is the
vibration rates that I taught you. So
all energy vibrating in different rates.
Okay? Well, you blocked something in
there. What does that mean? You held on
to something. You suppressed something.
You blocked something. It&#39;s blocked
inside your energy system. And now you
don&#39;t feel love. And now you don&#39;t feel
fulfilleness and and acceptance and all
the needs that you have. What are needs?
There are no needs. There are no
psychological needs. It means you
blocked your shakti. You&#39;ve blocked the
flow of energy. And now there&#39;s
something has to happen outside that
allows you to feel more open that allows
it to connect with you. Oh, we
connected. Why aren&#39;t you always
connected? Why are you separate? Okay,
spiritual is way deeper than you&#39;re
giving it credit for. You&#39;re a great
being. You&#39;re filled with shaky. You&#39;re
filled with love. If you hold your hands
out, they shy pours off of you of every
single one of your chakras. It just
pours out like light beams all the time.
If you walk through a hospital, as you
walk down the corridor, you feel it
pouring out of you, bringing healing.
You are a great being. You have
tremendous energy. You have no needs.
That&#39;s news to me. Why? You blocked
yourself. You blocked your energy flow.
How? By not being able to handle the
experience that happened to you. The
experiences happen. We said they happen,
right? But they didn&#39;t make it through.
You held on to them. You stored them.
you suppress them. Everything Freud
taught you, all of psychology, you hold
on to stuff. Well, if you hold on to it,
that&#39;s a vibration rate that&#39;s heavy and
energy can&#39;t pass through it. And so,
now you have to try to make things
happen in order for the energy to flow.
And that&#39;s what your needs and desires
and all that stuff are. So, you
eventually get to the point where you
catch on. I made a mess in here. But
nobody&#39;s willing to tell me that. They
sit there and say it&#39;s the outside world
did it to me. No, it did not. the
outside world unfolded and you couldn&#39;t
handle it. No, you don&#39;t understand. In
fifth grade, they bullied me. Well,
that&#39;s not nice. Why do they bullied
you? Because they&#39;re screwed up. They
dumped it on you. That&#39;s what&#39;s going
on, right? Okay, that was in fifth
grade. But I&#39;ve always had a problem.
I&#39;m always afraid people reject me.
They bullied you. You held on to it. Is
it possible that you could be mature
enough and grown up enough that by the
time you hit sixth or seventh grade, you
looked at that and said, &#34;Wow, the poor
people were they messed up. It&#39;s okay. I
forgive them.&#34; What if you could do
that? What if you let go? What if you
didn&#39;t hold it inside? What if you just
Well, I say fine. That happened to me
when I was young. It&#39;s not now and I&#39;m
fine and I don&#39;t hold it against
anybody. Wow. Now you&#39;ve opened. It&#39;s
called opening, isn&#39;t it? And what&#39;s
going to happen? and distract is going
to flow because you&#39;re open. You start
feeling all this energy. I would love
that you could go through a single day
and not hold stuff inside. Get to the
end of the day and say, &#34;Wow, that was
far out. What does it make? What
happens? You&#39;re sitting on a little
planet in the middle of nowhere and you
care what happened today. I know what
happened today. You did a 360 on your
axis. That&#39;s what happened today. You
couldn&#39;t handle it. Well, there were
some details and you&#39;ll eventually wake
up and realize you do not have to live
like this, but you&#39;ve trained yourself
to live like this. And so now your
consciousness is distracted by this
garbage that you held inside and you&#39;re
caught. Well, you this thing called yoga
is called liberation. You learn to
liberate yourself. It&#39;s notice it&#39;s way
greater than the asenas or gurus or
philosophies or that. It&#39;s like saying
you&#39;re in there and you&#39;re a great
being, but you&#39;re distracted by this
garbage you held inside. What should I
do? Let it go. And that&#39;s I&#39;m going to
finish. We&#39;re out of time. You want the
spiritual path? Let it go.
I&#39;m serious. That&#39;s the entire spiritual
path. If you don&#39;t have that stuff in
there, it&#39;s not going to distract you.
But how do I do that? It&#39;s simple to
talk about. Not easy to do, but it ain&#39;t
that hard. Do you understand that? You
little by little every day
be aware you&#39;re the consciousness that
you got garbage in there. Yesterday you
talked to somebody, you didn&#39;t like
their tone. Not sure what they meant by
it. I didn&#39;t like their tone. Wow. Okay,
man. Let&#39;s make a big deal out of it.
And today you saw them coming around the
corner and you didn&#39;t want to see them.
and something inside of you tried to
walk the other way and not have them see
you. Ever done it? Well, maybe that&#39;s
Maybe that is saying, &#34;Man, am I screwed
up?&#34; And I&#39;m going to stay that way as
opposed to I don&#39;t know whether anything
happened or not. It may have just been
in my mind and it doesn&#39;t matter
anyways. I&#39;m just sitting a plan in the
middle of nowhere. Told you 1.3 million
Earths fit inside the sun. 1.3 million
earths inside the sun and you care what
that person said yesterday out of 8.3
billion people and there&#39;s 300 billion
stars in your galaxy
wake up and what you do that day you see
them you feel your heart start to do
this you know I&#39;m talking about the
stuff that&#39;s down there starts to come
up which is why you don&#39;t feel love and
shock to you all the time because you
shove that garbage down there I&#39;ve
isolated one event somebody said
something yesterday and you catch
and you sit there and say, &#34;I don&#39;t want
to be like that. I want to be free. I
don&#39;t care whether they said something,
didn&#39;t say something good. Maybe they
had a stomach ache. None of my business.
I can handle it.&#34; That&#39;s your mantra. I
can handle it. I don&#39;t need to check out
why it happened. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t care. I
want to be free. And you don&#39;t walk
away. Whoa. Wait. You see, the first
time you do that, your ego is going to
go make all this like noise inside. all
that energy get all stirred up and you
just breathe through it and you go there
and you behave normal and next thing you
know you&#39;re glad you did that. You
didn&#39;t have to carry it. You have to
have another samscara, another pattern
that&#39;ll bother you the rest of your life
and next thing you know it&#39;s easier next
time and easier next time and easier
next time. Then you do with the driver
in front of you. Okay, fine. They drive
the way they want. None of my business.
It&#39;s okay. I won&#39;t be that late. Couple
of minutes, right? And you just start
letting go of yourself. And that&#39;s the
entire spiritual path. And now you see
why. If you stop storing that garbage
inside of you, it won&#39;t be in there. And
then the old stuff will come up. You let
it go. What am I supposed to let go? If
I you&#39;ll let it all go. But what if
somebody meant to be mean? So what?
I&#39;d rather be free. It&#39;s so funny. I&#39;m a
nice Jewish yogi. I don&#39;t read the
Bible. I read it once in 1972. But
Christ&#39;s words are yoga. They&#39;re
amazing. And the other thing, turn the
other cheek means
don&#39;t hold it against that. Just let it
go. Isn&#39;t turning the other cheek
letting it go. Let it go. Just let it
go. Why not? Who cares? I don&#39;t want
this stuff inside of me. And you just
keep doing that day in day. And you keep
letting go. Wait. Do you see what
happens? All of a sudden, all this shy
pouring through your being. You start
feeling all this love and joy and
eventually things don&#39;t bother you. Why?
Because you let them go. And then you&#39;re
the one that isn&#39;t distracted. From the
next thing you know, you&#39;re up higher.
And next thing you know, you fall
naturally into these great beautiful
states of ecstasy of nirvana. You&#39;re a
great being. Do not settle for being a
little thing that&#39;s lost down here. It&#39;s
not who you are. And you can grow. No
matter what you&#39;ve done, no matter where
you are, it&#39;s not true. You&#39;re the
consciousness that is caught looking at
this problem you created. When you let
it go, it will go.
