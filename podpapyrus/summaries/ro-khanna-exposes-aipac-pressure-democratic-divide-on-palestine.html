          <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
            
              <p class="mb-4">So re recently uh the number two House Democrat Katherryn Clark uh said at an event that what was happening in Gaza amounts to a genocide. That was seen by some observers as a signal that House Democrats were beginning to understand whether they care about the issue substantively in in any meaningful way. Set that aside. But they were starting to recognize that politically it it was becoming an albatross and that it was something that they needed to get right at least heading into the midterms.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">A couple days later, she came out and basically withdrew that and said, "I didn't mean to say that." And so what what can what can we understand about how House Democratic leaders like did you speak to her about that after she came out publicly and said that and before she retracted it and like where is where is House Democratic leadership on this issue at this point. &gt;&gt; I just reached out to her this morning saying can you get on my my letter to to recognize a Palestinian state. Look, my view is similar to uh to Senator Sanders that what has happened is uh absolutely horrific that the ICJ has already ruled that we need to take every legal, moral, political step uh to stop uh the killing and the starvation that the ICJ and the legal scholars will ultimately rule hopefully within the next year or two of what to what to call it. And there are a lot of independent human rights groups already who have weighed in.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">But what as we need to do as politicians uh is to stop it. To stop the military sales uh that are being used to to kill civilians, to recognize a Palestinian state, uh to uh uh to make sure that uh we are not uh complicit in uh in the killing. And and I I don't think the caucus is there yet. Uh I I think there's a growing number of people there.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">But the other thing we also have to do is bluntly call out the special interests that have intervened in uh Democratic primaries. Uh and this is why I reject all pack and lobbyist money and I'm for zero super PACs in in Democratic primaries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you I guess share if you have second anything, but can you talk about Apac there for a second.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">You've been going back and forth with them a bunch. &gt;&gt; looking for a fight with them. They keep they keep tagging me on saying, "Well, Roana is not putting pressure on Hamas." I condemned unequivocally the October 7th attacks. I've called unequivocally for two years for the uh the release of hostages.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">But when I speak out about gazins killed, by the way, even if uh 2/3 of those, let's just say, are civilians and a third what they say are combatants. I no one knows the exact number, but let's just be conservative. That is three times the amount of civilians who have been killed in Gaza than in Ukraine. I mean, it is a staggering number.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And so when I speak about that, that doesn't mean that I am somehow uh not condemning Hamas or not calling for the exchange of hostages. But with uh APEC, if you point out anything anything that is critical of Smoke Reach or Ben Gavir uh or Netanyahu, uh they come after you uh as they have uh me and on on on social media. And my question to them has been tell me one time, one thing you have said critical of Smoke or Ben Gavir or Netanyahu and they have not answered that question yet. But look, there's fear in uh among some of my colleagues uh about what what uh these groups can do.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">They they they spend millions of dollars. They've take they took out my friend Jamal Bowman. Uh they took out uh Representative Cy Bush. They came after Summer Lee.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh and uh you know there there's a sense of well do we really want to be targeted. But the the tides are changing and uh and and they're not now in the same position that they were even a year ago. &gt;&gt; But but I think for a lot of people it's not changing fast enough. Um so you know, you've been discussed, you know, openly as kind of a potential 2028 uh presidential candidate.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And of the of those presidential candidates, I' I'd say that you're probably kind of the most outspoken in your uh criticism of what Israel is doing in Gaza and the most willing to push back on the sale of some weapons. But nobody yet in that in that conversation is kind of going all the way to a Zoran Mandi position which would say it's apartheid, it's genocide, stop all weapon sales and and frankly uh everyone in Israel should have equal rights. That position doesn't seem to have anybody carrying the mantle yet. Um why why aren't you all the way there yet.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And do you think there is space for that in the Democratic party. &gt;&gt; Well, there's certainly space for uh the uh for Zoran Mandani uh and uh and and people who are are passionate about uh about Palestinian rights. Now, I have a my own view of it, which is that I think that the best way to get to peace is a two-state solution. And I don't think that that's just uh uh lip service.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I think you've seen the Arab League now uh em embrace that. You have in my view post Netanyahu an opportunity to do that including with land swaps and the United States can actively get involved in uh in in facilitating that recognizing that Palestinian self-determination uh has to be central. I have come out uh against military sales uh to uh you know that are being used to kill civilians. Now I know for some people that's not far enough.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh they want uh no funding even for things like Iron Dome. I just I'm for saving civilian lives. I believe that if we stopped the uh military sales of a lot of these offensive weapons that are what basically what Sanders and Delia Ramirez's resolutions call for, I believe you would stop the the war. And in terms of what what to to to call it, uh look, I I am a person of international law.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">The ICJ uh has already ruled that uh we need to be taking actions to stop uh the hor horrific nature of what's going on. uh and they're going to determine uh exactly what it should be called uh within the next year, year and a half and I will abide by what the ICJ says. This this to me is the position that maximizes the chance for peace. But my interest is in stopping the war uh and in figuring out how we have Palestinian self-determination.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And I welcome critiques from from from the left. You're you're right of sort of the conventional people who are seen as uh potential future leaders uh of our party in whatever role. Uh I have been probably the most outspoken. I voted against the funding.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I have called for a Palestinian state. I've co-sponsored Deia Ramirez's resolution. I supported both of Bernie Sanders's his resolutions. But there are certainly people to to to my left.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And that's what makes democracy healthy to to have that conversation. &gt;&gt; You know, the we just spoke to a doctor uh who does a lot of work around um helping to bolster uh healthcare capacity in Palestine. He's volunteered in Gaza. Uh he was amongst a small group of um u Muslim Americans who were invited to the White House last year uh with President Biden.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I think I believe this was in April. Um he walked out of that meeting before it ended in protest. uh he read out a letter to President Biden and walked out in protest over the administration's backing of Israel um in the genocide. And and you know, you've spoken about Senator Sanders and and and other Democrats in Congress who eventually have come around to starting to try and propose legislation to uh hold Israel to account or to to cut off weapons.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Um, but the leadership of the Democratic Party very much backs Israel. Um, and how do you contend with that as um someone who wants to uh run for president and lead the party. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, putting aside the the future, let me just say what I think that they anyone who wants to be in leadership uh, should be for. First of all, there were many of us, including Senator Sanders, who voted in April or May, I don't exact remember the exact date of 2024, against the funding of weapons to Israel.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So, uh it's not just uh the uh a position that Senator Sanders or I or others have adopted. Now, we were we had adopted this position during the Biden administration. I was on uh innumerable Sunday shows and television saying that the Biden policy on Gaza was uh disastrously wrong, that the Harris uh policy was wrong, that we needed a change of direction morally, substantively, but also politically. Uh I was out there arguing and advocating that at least we should have a Palestinian speaker uh at the DNC.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh they sent kept sending me to Michigan and I kept saying you can keep sending people like me to Michigan. It's going to make no difference unless the vice president offers Vice President Harris a new a new direction. I think there has been a tectonic shift in the last six weeks uh within the Democratic party. You now have Senator Sanders's resolutions getting majority support of uh senators.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">You now have an understanding that what Netanyahu has done uh and the current Lud party what they are doing uh is denying the self-determination of the Palestinian people is mass starvation is horrific uh and needs to be unequivocally condemned that there needs to be conditionality uh to uh any of the uh the arm cells going forward that there needs to be a real commitment to a Palestinian state and I believe that that is a a position that can get certainly majority support amongst Democratic voters and Democratic activists. Now, it is not an easy position. You would think that more people who are rumored as as as as future uh contenders for leadership of our party within the House, the Senate, whether they're going to run for president would take this position. But they know that they're they will incur the wrath of some very powerful donors in our party.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">uh and they will incur the wrath of uh uh certain people in the foreign policy establishment and so they either take choose the easy path which is just not to say anything uh or the conventional path. I I believe this is going to be a fault line uh in in in future races and people are going to be judged by it. And some people may find that my two-state approach is is is not uh the best one and they should be free to to throw their hat in the ring for whatever positions and and articulate their view. I do believe that the position I'm holding is our best chance to actually have Palestinian self-determination, peace, and is achievable uh in the next few years.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Um, I know you have to go in a moment. Um, but I want wanted to run through the members that you've gotten so far and also get a sense of where you think it'll go next. You you're uh you so you have uh Becca Balant who's the congresswoman from Vermont I believe uh uh Andre Carson Muslim member from Indianapolis right who's been you know very outspoken critic of of Israel for a while. Greg Casar and Maxwell Frost.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Um, interesting is both of them had complicated primary races in 2022 that involved um, DMFI and you know pro-Israel organizations. They won and now are putting themselves on this on this letter. Lloyd Dogget from Austin, what Veronica Escobar El Paso I think. Chewy Garcia from Chicago.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Al Green from Texas. Jar Jared Huffman your California colleague. Primila Gyipol, former chair of the progressive caucus, Hank Johnson from Georgia, Steven Lynch from Massachusetts, Betty McCollum from Minneapolis, uh who's, you know, led on a lot of these uh these letters and on this issue, uh James McGovern, uh Shelley Pingry from Maine, Mark Pokean, Wisconsin, um Jan Shicowski who's retiring um in Chicago, also Jewish, um uh Nit of Velasquez and Bonnie Watson Coleman from New Jersey. So th that's those are the signers so far.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I guess the most obvious ones that jump out. Nobody no none of the four squad members nor Summer Lee nor Dalia Ramirez um are on that. Did they do they think it doesn't go far enough. What's the where where have you spoken with Rashida Tihan Omar and others about &gt;&gt; I have part of it is it's the summer recess.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">So some of them are still evaluating it and may get on some of them &gt;&gt; things move very slowly in Washington this summer &gt;&gt; and and you know that we want to get this out before the UN General Assembly. So there is uh uh there is some time uh to to to build support. Some of it is a the framework is a two-state solution and there are people uh who disagree with with that framework and they uh may have that uh that concern. And also the letter calls for a Palestinian state without Hamas.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And uh there may be people who have a a concern about some of the uh the the the the prescriptions &gt;&gt; even Hamas has said that they're open to that. So &gt;&gt; yeah, I mean I'm I and I don't know, you know, I don't I'm not saying this is why certain members aren't getting on, but and some people may feel that to Sharief's point that, you know, right now they're focused on just stopping the slaughter and this is not this is not the the time. But I have uh you know with some pe I' I've taken a uh an approach of here's the letter and and and let me know if you have any questions and certainly with people uh in the squad or Delia Ramirez. I mean uh the last person to lecture them about uh what they should do is me.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I mean they they have been out in front on speaking about the human rights of of the situation. And so my approach has been okay uh here's the letter. Tell me your thoughts. and and some of them are considering it.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh more broadly, I'm hoping we can get uh people like Jamie people who voted against the funding in April, uh now with J Street's endorsement, uh people who say they're for two states, well, now is the time to actually make that more than rhetorical. Uh so I'm I'm hoping we will uh we will expand uh significantly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And what's what's been the reaction like privately or internally to &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think people are open.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">I think pe people need to realize how much this is crossing some of the uh the the pro-Israel uh organizations and how much they view this as a line in the sand. And so there's uh understandable pressure uh on members not to do it. But I think it is such an obvious thing for the United States to do uh especially given world opinion and other leaders that that I'm hopeful people will get there and and they'll see a safety in numbers and a safety in the organizations that are now uh endorsing it. But but like anything on this topic, it is a charged uh decision.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">Uh it comes with uh consequences for people in terms of their support bases. Uh but I think it is also something that voters now are demanding. And you know, one of the reasons that people broadly in the Democratic primary care about this or Democratic base care about this is the ability to stand up to some of the organizations and money uh for human rights signals something broader about uh a a person's values and commitments to a a progressive cause. a commitment to human rights, a commitment to uh to to to recognizing the dignity of people uh of all backgrounds and and and and faiths.</p>
            
              <p class="mb-4">And I I I think it has become a uh very salient issue in terms of a person's moral core and progressive &gt;&gt; Great. Well, Congressman, thank you uh for joining us here on this on the website news live stream. Really appreciate it..</p>
