As I look around the room of white men,
I think about my dad and I love the
headshake and I love the nod because
this is about racism. And if you can&#39;t
hear it from them, then hear it from me.
As a white woman and a daughter of a man
of privilege and power,
he knew that his strength was to bring
people that didn&#39;t look like him to the
table of government.
And so 50 years later,
after Barbara Jordan, aided by white
people to have a voice,
the first woman of color elected to the
south, a woman who sat in the
impeachment of Nixon, a woman who said
that finally after amendment, debate,
and vote, I am finally part of we the
to stand here as a 50-year-old woman and
know that we now go back in time.
So, let&#39;s talk about cowardice
and cheats.
Because if you knew you could win this
next election, you wouldn&#39;t be taking
this effort to try to steal five seats
from elected officials that members of
color elected to represent them in
Washington DC.
You wouldn&#39;t be doing everything you can
to take this coalition of diversity
and stand up at the mic and say, &#34;Why
are we doing this?&#34; because we can
and you shield your racism with your
With ignorance and arrogance.
To come up here and say, &#34;To be honest
with you, I haven&#39;t read the bill from
the other side.
To be honest with you, I haven&#39;t talked
to the lawyers to be bringing this
before.&#34; Because you think that people
will give you grace on ignorance and
arrogance around party because you can&#39;t
admit that the root of all of this is
about racism and power.
A power grab.
A pure power grab.
And so I&#39;m going to ask, don&#39;t shake
your head because I&#39;m going to give you
a moment to prove what you mean behind
Because when Donald Trump called Georgia
Republicans
and said, &#34;Hey boys, I need you to steal
me almost 12,000 votes.&#34;
To those men credit,
they said, &#34;No, sir.
We already know what Governor Abbott
In a few minutes, we&#39;re going to find
out what y&#39;all say.&#34;
Vote no on this bill.
Chair, I got Mr. Martinez Fischer.
