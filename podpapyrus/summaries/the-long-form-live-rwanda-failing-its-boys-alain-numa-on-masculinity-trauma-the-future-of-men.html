This is the very very best. I introduce
the very very next big deal. You know
this is the big league.
Make a big fish.
If you want the long form, come close.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, wait, what? The long form. What did
he say? The long form. What?
The long form.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The long form. The long.
Now, before we begin today&#39;s
conversation,
I&#39;d like us to examine the scope of the
in Rhonda. Right now, something is
happening quietly. and it&#39;s not getting
the attention I believe it deserves.
Boys are falling behind.
The numbers tell the story. In primary
and secondary schools, girls are
finishing at higher rates than boys and
the gap is growing. Over 60% of all
drugrelated arrests in Rhonda involve
young men. More than 85%
of prisoners are male. And when it comes
to mental health, most boys never learn
to talk about sadness, failure, or fear.
They turn to silence. And sometimes
things happen that are much, much worse.
Boys though are not broken. They are not
the enemy. But right now, they are being
left behind. So tonight, we ask a hard
question. Is Rhonda failing its boys?
And if the answer is yes, what will we
do about it?
Now to talk about this issue, I&#39;d like
to introduce my guest,
Alan Numa.
Now, if you don&#39;t know who Alen Numa is,
he&#39;s a former liberation fighter and now
he&#39;s a corporate social uh
responsibility manager at MTN Rhonda.
Alle is also the founder of Boys to Men,
an initiative that is that that aims to
shape the next generation of young men.
Since he started the initiative two
years ago, he&#39;s run three camps for
three weeklong camps for boys between
the ages of 12 to 16 to help them
address their issues and de and develop
life skills. So far, over 215 families
have been impacted positively.
In this conversation that I have I will
have with him, I want to discuss Randon
masculinity,
what positive masculinity looks like,
what it should look like, why we are
getting it wrong when it comes to
raising welladjusted men and attempt to
answer this question. How can we fix the
boy problem?
So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
long form. Ala, I hope you&#39;re
comfortable.
Yes. Thank you so much, Sunny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s an absolute pleasure to have you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good evening, everyone. It&#39;s a pleasure
to be here. Does everyone Can everyone
hear us?
Mic a bit higher. Oh, let me help uh you
eash and e microphone will work to
Thank you so much. It&#39;s a pleasure to be
here and especially in front of my
chairman Gundu. Thank you so much. And
my lovely wife who came with me. Thank
you so much, Sunonny.
It&#39;s a huge pleasure. And and guys, just
so you uh know, this is not just going
to be a conversation between me and him.
We&#39;re going to have a conversation and
then because this is not a an issue that
he&#39;s just facing or we&#39;re just going to
talk about, I want everyone&#39;s input. So,
we&#39;re going to have a couple of
questions from him and then I will I
want the conversation to be not just
one-sided. I want us to not just have
conversations between the both of us and
people and ourselves but even among each
other. Now
you were born in 1970 you know 1973 in
Zire to a Belgian uh father and a Roman
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but unfortunately you&#39;ve never met your
father today. How&#39;s this affected the
way you move through life as a man?
Well, uh
I I don&#39;t know where to start from, but
uh the long story came started when yes,
I was born
from that Belgian father and Randy&#39;s
mother. By when I was 5 years, we moved
to Burundi where the grand grandparents
uh were living as refugees. So I started
growing from there. So a little boy
Mongu in the community
and uh life wasn&#39;t easy to everyone
everyone as a refugee. So I started
growing from there with a lot of
difficulties.
the my life was I can describe it uh
describe it as a broken pieces
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because now being a refugee that was one
for the grandparents but plus me with
mixed colors was where do you belong
home? M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so these were some of the experience I
got even in school
uh this was bundi when in school
a certain time people could uh teachers
would ask kids where are you from
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are you a bundian? No. A congallesa?
Randis? Yes. And what about you?
So I was also confused by then as I said
who am I my skin is Zongu
parents so-called parents my mother was
still alive she passed on she passed
away in 86
so that
that period that experience wasn&#39;t good
so being me as me growing in that
to cut this story short
I call it lack of identity.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I didn&#39;t have a specific identity.
Even at a certain point I had to call
one of the Burundian richman businessman
my father. I didn&#39;t know him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the name was very known in the whole
country. So I said my father this is my
father. Was he white?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I never met him. I don&#39;t know who he
is. I heard about a story. This man is
this, he has this, this is belong to
him. And I decided this is my father. So
he was a soldier, a canoel,
a pilot of a helicopter was actually
Wow. So I&#39;m going to Okay, that that was
it. So I grew up being a son of that
man. So being a
being a pilot he moved he used to move
out of Bundi.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So it was confirming oh yes so maybe
this is one of the son that he brought
from Europe. So that&#39;s why he&#39;s here. So
it was confirming and I have a peaceful
life by then.
very complicated. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No it&#39;s it but because a lot of times
because I&#39;m also raising boys. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I I see that responsibility as a as
a father to be able to teach them how to
become men.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, who&#39;s teaching you to be a man other
than your imaginary dad?
I can&#39;t tell how. Yes, I got that
education and culture teaching by my
grandparents
but it wasn&#39;t enough because my my
situation I I I was feeling I&#39;m not
belonging to that community. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So how it became
how I had to learn the men who I am
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; at 17 at 18 years I had to join in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; where today I confirm that I got
identity from
we used to say
now but for me they gave me nan an
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So before are you saying that before
you were a man without an identity?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was a man
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; without identity. Is that what you&#39;re
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. But you knew your So why
choose because
1990 1991
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; things were things were not easy. Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um
would you where did you learn about
being random?
How did that were you just being um you
know when you&#39;re an 18-year-old?
You don&#39;t think about death like that.
You it&#39;s it seems fun. It&#39;s like a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Were you you know some people were
driven by patriotism,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? the identity, the Randon
identity. You seem like a person who was
trying to figure out what that identity
Why then choose the hardest of paths?
Why choose the path that could have led
you to death?
That was that&#39;s the part of patriotism
now from parents because we grew up
make sure you you you keep your your
your your values as Rwans make sure you
you you don&#39;t be like others others you
understand who I&#39;m talking about and
actually I don&#39;t who are the others
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; okay the you see like congalles we are
totally different we totally different
and even in Ronda as in Bundians the
culture seems not too different but
again the uh the specific values that
Randans had because you know although
they spent 30 years in in in exile but
they had hope the following day that we
could go back home. So that partism
will came down even to kids but not all
kids now uh captured that one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the way I I choose to join that hard
for me it was one to get out of the
situation I was in as being a lack of an
identity. So I had to choose to join
others for the good cause. So joining
others, joining others and by the
permission of grandparents asking them
can I go?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So you are you&#39;re not one of those ones
who fled in the night.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. Yeah, it was it was night. It was
night but again with the permission
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I had to ask can I go? Even today I
just imagining that level of patriotism
where parents can let kids children go
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and where to go is that the hardest uh
part you&#39;re talking about. So that&#39;s how
I decided to join that part. Now
obviously you survived and that&#39;s why we
here. I thank God. those four years
in in in the mountains in in the
valleys, in the swamps, what did they
teach you
being part of the young men and women of
the RPA? What did they teach you about
positive masculinity?
First of all, one was being rand
you have stood up because of the change.
We are here to change something.
which is what the the ideology that was
there by then. For me being part of this
the most discipline I got from from my
leaders was being around you need to
have these values. One discipline
second make sure we are changing uh the
situation that was in in Rwanda by then.
So I had to follow those rules and the
discipline that&#39;s where discipline
that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the source of the
discipline.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I&#39;m hearing discipline.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are the positive values?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male values.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male values was to be the man behind the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that you are able and you can do this
you can change. It wasn&#39;t easy. The
situation war is war. War is war. You go
two you come back one or you even perish
all of you. But having this uh emphasize
that you can change this, you can drive
this change. This was building uh a
confidence in everyone which is
the the my foundation today.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m hearing so I&#39;m hearing discipline
and a sense of ownership.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um and a sense of responsibility to
yourself and your country. So those are
the kind of uh tenants I&#39;m I&#39;m hearing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So one of the hardest things that young
men who and women who participated in
the liberation war was having to deal
with the aftermath of war and what they
experienced, what they saw. How did you
deal with what you saw in a healthy way?
Right? Because especially within the
context of being random where they
there&#39;s a saying that the tears of a man
remain unshed. Uh my kinyand is not that
great. Someone can maybe you can
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there you go.
So how did you
because there&#39;s uh the reason I&#39;m saying
this because there are people that I
knew who because of what they saw they
had to deal with it in a very unhealthy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; True.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um we&#39;ve lost a lot of
uncles, brothers, cousins to
alcoholism
and other very negative behavior.
But somehow you&#39;re still here and you&#39;re
smiling and and you&#39;re a a member of
How did you deal with what you saw and
how did you deal with that that that
mental aspect of life beyond the war?
I can&#39;t say that there was a superman to
overcome that situation and we honor all
those who who left us.
But again there&#39;s I I can&#39;t say there&#39;s
something personally I did to make sure
I&#39;m following this the the the this
direction because as you are saying yes
there are two direction and what you
choose is where you go.
Yes. What you saw was very bad. Even
sometimes when you think about it you
bring back the images and you start
recalling why me? Why? How am I standing
today as you are saying smiling founding
my family? How what what have I done?
But I I think the the way I grow up
with that hush hush education from from
my grandparents
helped me to be who I am today. How?
because we had that now uh on top of the
education of that situation I got uh I
mean that foundation the dedication
foundation I got from my grandparents it
was supported by my leaders during the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; where your leaders kept telling what you
heard even before
you are here to fight for your country
all these I felt like I am responsible
and I&#39;m the one
to take that ownership to be who I am.
Be a Rondon, keep those values, the few
I I I I knew by then. That&#39;s how I kept
my line.
Not that I was perfect. Yes, it was
possible to divert and to go to another
direction but
up to today I thank God I kept that good
uh direction which is today. I&#39;m not I&#39;m
not uh talking about those who diverted
who are still uh
living in those bad situation today but
I don&#39;t know how but again it be it
based on the foundation you got from the
previous uh during your childhood with
your parents. So it wasn&#39;t uh because of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It wasn&#39;t that. No. Um
you did not find God because some people
you know if they did not choose
this path they would end up being uh you
know they become balok
you are you one of those ones?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I became a later.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So maybe that&#39;s how you dealt with it as
well. I think that&#39;s why God kept me
alive so to to to to have me as his
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I became a pastor but this is 10
years ago but by by then I was not
practicing it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I I might be wrong but you know to
kind of move it from you um it seems to
me you know I&#39;m an observer of our
society. I I read, I talk to people, and
I observe what&#39;s going on. And it seems
to me, and women, please forgive me. Um,
I&#39;m going to say a lot of random men,
random men, but it&#39;s not that uh I think
that women are not important, but in my
observations here, I&#39;m going to talk
the gentlemen. So in my in my
observations, it seems to me that a lot
of rounded men suffer from stuff like
alcoholism,
depression,
trauma, and just an inability to
maintain stable relationships in the
That&#39;s my observation. And I&#39;m I&#39;m
curious, do you feel the same way? And
if so, why do you think that is the
my own obser observation as well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. So we&#39;re not experts. Hh
observation
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as a man even at at
age 10 even below in your family a boy
is a man. If a boy falls down they say
hey wake up. Whoa. Yes. And he wakes up.
Yes I can. So as young boy you grow up
knowing that you know. You grow up
knowing that yes you you can as a man
even in I say
even in the Bible that&#39;s what he says
and you find you grow up having in mind
yes you can you are the man knowing or
not knowing but you you know that you
know even if you know that you don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so you find a man Even at even if you up
to the age where you make you you you
found your your your family, you still
there as the man who is can stand on his
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; who can&#39;t learn from another man
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; who can&#39;t listen from to to another man
that I know and in
we know it&#39;s there it&#39;s there&#39;s
nothing that You can teach me that I
don&#39;t know but at the end I&#39;m so sorry.
Yeah, we don&#39;t know.
Yeah. So
I just want to just so that I I get you
to So the things that I&#39;ve mentioned is
that what you also observe?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
Because I I had um
a a few months ago I had on this very
podcast uh a a Randon psychotherapist
and he was speaking about
you know the generational trauma that
Rondons have and they manifest
differently um between the sexes and he
was talking about you know men choosing
you know we have very high numbers of
male suicides
uh alcoholism
uh uh antisocial behavior. So I I was
wondering if you know what you&#39;d seen in
your practice as a pastor
how these things whether those things
were just academics or they were real
You know in in this context you see
even us went through alcohol
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but during our gen our generation we we
couldn&#39;t do it openly.
We used to drink but again under the
table behind the curtains you can&#39;t meet
your dad or your mom or your parents
that one. You see, as kids, we used to
play the wedding
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; story
and we could even put on everything like
this a ceremony. You, your wife, you
move, you do the wedding. Who was your
She&#39;s here.
So that&#39;s what we used to do. Even now
it&#39;s happen. But the way it happened now
that&#39;s the case drinking it openly
my rights plus social media I know what
I&#39;m doing I&#39;m mature I have right to do
this now going to this wedding thing for
them they don&#39;t joke now they go
straight to the real wedding that&#39;s how
we end up having okay let&#39;s talk from
there but what I get now is yes the
is that one
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and now
how it is increasing right can I go
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the way it is increasing is now that
lack of connection with your parents so
let me ask you about that that
connection
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I believe that
men raise men now
good men raise good men
and vice versa now in your exper
experience as a mentor as well as
you know you&#39;re also a pastor you do
some pastoral work.
It&#39;s very easy for us to
you know as you&#39;ve said you know these
these boys are becoming impossible.
They&#39;re drinking. they&#39;re engaging in in
activities that you would say that would
um are negative.
So, who&#39;s raising these boys and why are
why are we seeing the outcome do you
think that we&#39;re seeing today?
that the disconnection part of it I was
talking about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; disconnection between who and who
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the parents father and boys because
whenever you meet your dad either he
tells you that
be a real man and that&#39;s it
or you don&#39;t meet because the dad is
busy doing his work he&#39;s looking for
he&#39;s at work and you you at school by
the time he&#39;s coming back you are
sleeping by the time he&#39;s in the weekend
he&#39;s going out you are also going out
now so there is that disconnection
there&#39;s no time to meet to sit down
which we used to have before but then I
would like to challenge the the dads
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean those are your kids
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when you tell me that you do not have
time to sit down with them what are you
That&#39;s the thing
are choosing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we lost that responsibility over ours.
Can I give you my my my experience, my
strategy? I did uh we we used at home.
I funded the government. I have two boys
and two girls.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And are you the president?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually, no. I&#39;m the chairman. I&#39;m the
top. But the MD um I mean the prime
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the wife she&#39;s there and the boys our
first daughter she&#39;s not around but the
two boys which I was focusing on mainly
because I was I I saw things coming so I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what did you see coming
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I what is available I mean the the
drugs and drinking and this
disconnection and you go in that
negative uh you&#39;re losing These randon
values you find your kids kids not only
mine even kids in general you find there
on the street early morning when you are
going to work they&#39;re coming out from
the nightclub all these so I saw that
what is available in the town so we
funded the government
the government prime minister we have
one in charge of security and uh and uh
another one is uh infrastructure Those
are your two boys. How old are they?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That uh the second boy is 22, another
one is now 16.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The reason of doing this not not those
position. I wanted
me and my we wanted something that will
keep us connected to these guys because
beyond of being that minister we need to
sit down every month when they&#39;re coming
for money to pick money from the prime
minister that they will be paying
suku all these and we sit down for
evaluation but in mind it&#39;s not
evaluation it&#39;s not leadership per say
but it&#39;s to have them on board. So we
created that friendship. I call them
bajama the best friend. Yo, so tomorrow
make sure 6 we sit down evaluation
and we reward them. But the reward is to
give them responsibility to give them
something to do. They make sure they are
always home. So even if me personally
where I work from for MTN I used to
travel a lot country and spend like one
week but with that accountability you
are still connected even on phone how is
it Rihano
imagine one of the goals one had as a
infrastructure was to have that cash
power you see that the the sound when
the power is almost going disturbing
they said this is my goal you will never
hear this again. So he they started
having it as their own responsibilities
and they need to report to the big boss
the chairman.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that&#39;s how I did and it worked.
That&#39;s how everything that&#39;s how my
YouTube channel started
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; say and the way it started it was during
co kids those boys they were like dad
you know they are always asking us how
to do this can we start doing this on on
on YouTube I say okay let&#39;s do YouTube
and we started so a certain period we
could get parents calling us thank you
so much you know now I founded now my
government at home kids are there they
are in charge of you know these clocks
and they they they have been blocked
long time ago because of that uh it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s no longer working like for
ages but the boy in charge of this
started now looking at everything every
single thing in the house so that&#39;s how
I believe some parents started getting
connected to to their boys
by the way just so that people can also
find you on YouTube what&#39;s your YouTube
uh handle
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; my YouTube handle is numat talk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Numat talk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So please uh subscribe.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can advertise uh e-cash.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have more than 20,000 subscribers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right.
Now let&#39;s um talk about the work that
you&#39;ve done in boys to men
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in your yearly boys camp. What are the
common threads that you&#39;re seeing in
terms of
what are the boy what is what are the
boys like you know what are the things
that you see just keep coming back
because obviously the whole point of the
camp is to teach positive masculinity
within the running context
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; true so obviously if someone needs to
that thing it&#39;s because they lack it so
I&#39;m I&#39;m interested in in in in
what you&#39;ve seen, what what are they
lacking exactly?
when you see parents handing over their
boys to you, don&#39;t you sometimes think,
huh, these these random parents, they&#39;re
really giving me the responsibility of
raising their children. Where are they?
Do you mind if I can just give you the
background on how this started?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
One night there&#39;s that boys to men
coming in my head
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the song.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So not really.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I am like I said I know boys to men I
know them
but boys to men is sticking in my head
and I tell my my wife said look at this
now I have this
message in my head. wake up and do
something for the boys.
And uh no offense all issues that were
coming in my face was one yes drug abuse
and now what is hitting our country as
early pregnancies in my image I saw a
lot of uh program talking to girls make
sure you bear girls don&#39;t don&#39;t listen
to those boys and I realized that was my
own observation I realized that there
were no one talking to boys that don&#39;t
go there.
Huh? So now that started coming in my
head. Imagine I went up to wedding uh
when I say by the way during the the
pre-wedding we have bridal shower. I&#39;ve
never heard about groom shower. And
that&#39;s how we end up being in a
relationship after relationship. Do the
wedding after wedding in your in your
family. You start expecting the same
thing you used to get from your mom and
you want to to do to have the same from
your wife. Yet you&#39;re waking up at the
same time in the morning you go to work
and you come back at the same time
tonight night and you&#39;re expecting her
to to cook to two. No. No.
I told her, &#34;What do you think about
it?&#34; And she&#39;s she&#39;s a pastor. She told
me, &#34;That&#39;s your calling. That&#39;s what
God wants you to do.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I said, &#34;Ah, no. I have my own life.&#34;
And I ignored. ignoring I couldn&#39;t sleep
anymore. Boys to men stick.
Imagine for the first edition boys to
men was coming to perform in that period
in Rwanda.
We started let&#39;s have this first
edition. I spoke to my partner Gas
Research Foundation. He&#39;s like I said I
have an international school. It&#39;s a
boarding school. Whenever during holiday
you have my support bring them.
So to bring who?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Who who am I? Even if I collect all my
friends to give me their son, it can&#39;t
work because the image or what we are
focusing on is kids uh boys from 12 to
16 years.
I was like I said let me release a
registration link.
I released this morning a registration
link. It was full that night. 60 boys.
So that g
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s 2023 that 2023 that gave me a
confirmation one
these parents not all of them they don&#39;t
know numal who is numal so a parent who
can decide to send his boys out of home
for a period of a week to a with a
person I don&#39;t know
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know say maybe this is it must
be there is an issue
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there&#39;s a crisis
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so I&#39;m here So that was a message I got
revelation even me I was now start I
started learning so I&#39;m taking the boys
where am I taking them
that&#39;s where now the theme or the main
message from this boys to men is me
personally to give back to my country
I got shaped by Ronda I got shaped
So I should do the same.
[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Now, so we have the full full 60
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wake up in the morning.
My plan was to charge
during the press conference. I&#39;m like
the voice is like a man
no single coin make sure I do this on
your own
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ask what do you think let&#39;s move
so we covered the cost
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it took the boys 16 so during the camp I
was also learning
but by learning I could see now you know
day two you see what kind of boys you
And automatically you know where they&#39;re
coming from. Coming from I mean the
background
the education or the values where
they&#39;re coming from I could tell.
Imagine another good thing I got was the
mix kids from village and kids from
international school here. that mix.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which is interesting because sometimes
when we we have these conversations
about boys, we think it&#39;s only an elite
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But
I think
the diversity of your your people shows
that it&#39;s actually also an issue in the
villages. Even with the people who don&#39;t
have as much money, they&#39;re still having
issues with their boys. Because at the
beginning, we thought we are going to
take them out of their gadget. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but you find another kid from Charu they
they don&#39;t know what his gadget so what
is their problem
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; now their problem is now to to shape
them because uh the the father is never
there is never at home but if this is
the what I got from the the parents from
the village I said at least I got
another father who can stand on my
behalf and take care of my kids for that
one week maybe he will come back as a
and that that was the diversity. So it
the the background or the feedback from
parents is totally different.
But how do you turn a boy into a man in
a week? in a week. Unfortunately
that the plan wasn&#39;t that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know since
that&#39;s the the capacity we had I mean
funding this it&#39;s something
the the way it is designed we&#39;re
supposed to to have two weeks in the
camp they go back they come back to uh
the holidays of festive season now for
another version to become a man in in
But up to now the third edition we don&#39;t
have means. We are still using our our
salary we pick few few few and we keep
for the whole year to make sure at least
that one week but believe me sunny in
one week you see the change. So what are
what exactly are you doing during the
camp? During the camp, during the camp,
first of all, the discipline is at the
Arrival first of all, they don&#39;t know
where they&#39;re going.
They see they have traveled
30 minutes out of town. They see the
houses. Everything is good. But now the
experience is uh instructors I have uh
in the camp
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instructors that did in Gando to they
know what they talk they are doing start
shaping them from there here you don&#39;t
talk anyhow this is not your home make
sure you on the line make sure you talk
when they ask you a small part of
military style
and uh Yes. Another experience at the
beginning that very night is the food
because I try to do day one 2 3 they go
totally local food.
So now that&#39;s where you see kids from
village they&#39;re like ah we left this at
but so we are still having this and you
find someone now from
they say what the hell is this
they gave me something white what is
white and to find out
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; white thing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because I have I create in par the the
group WhatsApp for parents at least to
update them on daily basis what is going
on. So that&#39;s an example to taking a p
taking a picture of that kunga sending
to the group I say whoever is having kid
that we never and you find a parent
coming and that&#39;s my kid who&#39;s never had
there&#39;s nothing else you can give me say
did you send him to a restaurant we have
kunga and that&#39;s it oh my god he&#39;s going
to die they say fine
and at the end I send another picture
that that kunga was no longer there and
the kid is like so there&#39;s nothing else
than what is nothing else this is not a
restaurant
2 3 4 hours you find him already in the
kitchen and say please bring bring it
the way it is so that one of the
experience local food that they never
experience
and uh the following morning what do we
do we we group them into into
section that every day there&#39;s something
they are doing in uh cows to cleaning
the farm to go in the
to clean their rooms to make their beds
to clean their clothes. It&#39;s it&#39;s a good
experience.
A kid go with a white shirt by the time
he&#39;s he&#39;s going back home he&#39;s khaki but
at least he had that experience of
cleaning. So they waking up very early
morning at 5. They go for 1.5 km mucha
not walk run
and yeah you understand the the the
difference the the the type of kids we
have by then
that&#39;s the one and then we have uh
during the day we have a session we
always call mentors that they at least
they can share something tangible with
these kids not only on entrepreneurship
even if they are doing entrepreneurship
in their schools
But at least they need someone known.
For example, last year
I I I brought the public figures that
they know. So I bring coach G for from
Kari Universe. I said, &#34;Ah, so this is
the guy.&#34; So telling them, sharing with
them their testimonies, how he became a
man, how he became rich, he&#39;s rich, I
have money now, I have money, you can
have the same money. So that kind of
mentors I bring uh during the camp to
take them through. So what we teach them
uh mentors we we we have one Rondan
patriotism,
Christian values and then we go up to
GBV. We go to these uh the the use of
social media, the good and bads. All
these this is in summary how the the
camp look like. Do those boys do?
Because obviously after a while they
start seeing you as parent parent
parental figures.
And what young boys will do once they
see you as a role model or as a parent,
they&#39;ll start talking to you
when they when when they talk to you,
what are they saying about
their experience back home? How they
relate to their parents? How they relate
to their schools? How they relate to
their friends?
First of all, before we close the camp
that day three,
I sit down with them, give them papers
and pens, please write to your parents,
tell them you&#39;re missing them, give them
the message of your from the camp. So
they take time to write letters.
So what I do, I collect all those
letters and I go into my room. I start
reading one by one. The reason of
reading is going because I want to know
what they expressing from their heart.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You find one kid is like, &#34;Dad, I didn&#39;t
know you hate me this much. Please come
and pick me now.&#34;
So once identifying those who are not
not happy means even the change can be
very difficult.
The following morning those who are not
happy I appoint them as commanders of
those sections because they know they
lead by example they can&#39;t go the same
way. So those are the guys that by the
time we close the camp they&#39;re like can
you add more few more days so we are we
still enjoying this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that&#39;s how I start uh connecting with
them. By the time I sit down with them,
I give I share my own experience not
leaving any single part.
Now I&#39;m writing the book which I think
it will will help
few parents or not.
I share my own experience how I became
and on top of that
uh season two I started doing the one to
I wanted to hear now from their heart
your situation I request parents
whoever feels that he&#39;s comfortable I
can talk to his son please let me know I
engage him one to on.
So now where the issue you find parents
they know what is going on
can you please talk to that boy
he&#39;s not he&#39;s in this plane is what
I said if you as a dad you can confirm
this now it&#39;s you&#39;re totally wrong
in this plane how he became in this pl
where have you been and I say this is
not pre-whawa
We are not taking kids that are almost
going toward for the next. No, we want
to shape the theme. The moto of boys to
men is shaping tomorrow&#39;s men today.
You find when you&#39;re talking to a boy,
he tells you the disconnection between
him and father. the father why he lives
in China
raised by a single mom
and you find they don&#39;t have time to
them. Another very critical uh message I
got from the one to one is no one tells
them that they can. The same me message
I got uh during the the bush.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that&#39;s a positive affirmation. Yes.
So no one tells me that they know me as
just someone who is there. No one tells
me that I&#39;m able. I can do this. Do you
if you do you have some savings? Yes.
What are you doing? There&#39;s nothing. So
what is your dream?
I was I wanted to be a pilot but my dad
told me that I need to be an engineer.
So you find that
the support is there&#39;s lack of support.
telling the boy that yes you can the
same yes you can of when you are still a
boy it&#39;s needs to come to the reality
where now they tell you that yes you can
and you can become this so when I talk
to them as me sharing with them this
experience
I realized when because after two months
we do assessment but assessment on phone
call asking parents we share a form tell
us about this where you feel like there
is still a gap. Can I engage him one
even if you&#39;re not going to to the camp
but I pick him we stay together in the
weekend and we talk as men so trying to
to give them that power they feel that
yes the man I want to be I&#39;m starting
and we got positive feedback from
parents thank you so much either my kids
now can eat local food my kids now wake
up and can make his bed is always at
home. He listen to us. We we we we
interact and they are ready to we are
ready to support him. We got that we
were wrong not supporting his idea, his
dreams. All these kind of positive
feedback. So this is what I get from and
I hopefully you you also talk to the
parents and say this is where
you can improve.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
Because I think fundamentally putting
the responsibility on the young men, the
boys is,
you know, you you you you can&#39;t put that
level of responsibility on them and kind
of leave the parents wanting. As I
promised all of you, um this would not
be just a conversation between the both
of us. Maybe we also have
uh someone who&#39;s big in the law
former chief justice. How are you doing
Can you can someone give uh the
microphone to
Sir, can you hear me?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m good. But
I came to listen. I didn&#39;t come to talk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ah.
Who else? Who else uh can help us
understand
what the risk the overall the at the
micro level what the risks factors are
of having
unhealthy young men at a national level.
I think from from
what I had
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh
this is a very uh interesting uh
discussion
uh about uh especially the this the
social and mental health of our our
young men.
Uh and of course uh from my uh
experience as you say uh if uh a a child
grows up in a kind of dysfunctional
uh family
uh then there is more temptation to
uh criminality.
Uh if a a child is not uh brought up uh
uh knowing the the the values of his
uh and not getting the advice from from
the parents
uh that he needs then of course there is
a a risk that uh uh he will end up uh in
some bad company. He&#39;ll end up uh being
attracted by different uh things uh
whether from social media or from his
friends and end up uh in a in a bad
situation.
Uh so uh I&#39;m glad that uh there is this
uh program that the the pastor is is
pursuing of a kind of reor orienting
uh young men. Um giving them the
opportunity to to learn about their
values and how they can grow up to be uh
responsible
uh adults.
Yeah. So,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thank you. Thank you so much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh there&#39;s also someone who wants to say
something. Mos Carimera.
Thank you, Sun.
And uh I would like to thank Mr.
for the
uh good job he&#39;s doing for the for the
and uh
Sunonny when he introduced the topic you
mentioned about the
uh school school dropout
uh numbers of boys and men in collection
facilities
and uh
there as
Huge numbers actually in the
rehabilitation centers
and uh boys and men um are good numbers
though the number of girls and women are
also competing these days.
Uh but uh
I I have u uh one question only one
contribution to Mr.
Uh because
when you drop from school
uh the next uh the next level you become
a street kid. Then you start abusing
uh drugs or alcohol
and you end up in
rehabilitation centers.
And uh this is u
uh maybe because of the
uh broken families with conflict.
And uh
when you when you are looking for
something from your family, from your
parents and you don&#39;t get it,
you get out of the family to look for it
somewhere else.
and uh
and this is u actually uh what is Mr. is
doing now.
Uh it&#39;s very very important for the
Uh the country knows
this is a big problem.
When you look
at the number
of the boys and girls in in in
rehabilitation centers and it is
increasing every day.
Even parents bribe
bribe give the bribe
for the authorities to take their uh
their their kids to the rehabilitation
centers which is not a solution
maybe I would encourage Mr. Numa not to
work as a standalone to work with the
government actually
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to look for the
not finding not uh uh more facilities
to look for the pre
prevention
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead of uh because u the the
authorities they go to minister of
finance asking for more money. We need
uh to uh to to build more rehabilitation
centers. That&#39;s not going to be solution
for this country.
We should work together.
I&#39;m telling you know Mr. who is who is
already in that field.
Uh to look for the partners to look for
the because there is uh uh good policies
which can help to prevent
the uh what you call the street kids.
anyway Mr. No, I thank you very much
from experience from the
uh Araba and now you are doing this for
the nation and uh uh keep it up. Thank
you very much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I want to hear the viewpoint of a
young man. Are there any young men?
Junior, you&#39;re still a young man.
So Junior, I want to I want to ask a
question now that you&#39;ve decided to to
speak on behalf of young men. Are we
exaggerating? You know, one of the
things that we love to do as Randons is
to exaggerate, you know, everything&#39;s a
crisis. Everything jets,
Are we overexaggerating
what&#39;s happening
because we just we&#39;re in a bubble or do
you actually think it&#39;s it&#39;s actually as
scary as we&#39;re all kind of saying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um first of all thank you for for this
opportunity and thank you to San and
Alan for such a very insightful
conversation. Um I was joking joking
with my colleague next to me that were
talking about this very same topic
before you started. And to answer your
question bluntly, I I don&#39;t think we pay
enough attention to the crisis of the
young men. And the reason I put my hand
up um is because I&#39;ve been following a
trend that has been plaguing the west
and as we know everything that plagues
the west eventually gets to us is a
concept called incelss.
Intels is um a trend among young men
that have become disconnected to society
and some of the traits that comes with
them um is hostile sexism, mis misoism,
um anti-feminism, a sense of
entitlement, self-pity, self-pity,
self-loathing and sometimes racism and
other extreme tendencies. So, so there
are some people who don&#39;t know what an
incel is. You&#39;ve given us the symptoms.
What&#39;s an incel? What does that mean?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An incel is um a young man is usually
it&#39;s a a trend of of young men usually
between the age of 13 to 21 that f feel
disconnected and feel rejected by
society. And um the incel movement has
become a sense of a way of radicalizing
these young men and justifying their
pains because these young men feel
they&#39;ve been rejected by their families
and society. And that is a direct result
of young men not having a place where
they can be heard and a place where they
can be mentored. Uh a place like what
Alliance is trying to do with boys to
men. So to answer your question, Sunny,
I think the crisis might not be very
visible in Africa,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but this conversation is being had among
parents. Um, and I&#39;m very very glad
people like Alan have taken action. And
Alan, by the way, I&#39;d like to volunteer
for your next me u your next movement.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let me know what you need. I&#39;ll
definitely want to join you in this
movement because I do also have a big
heart. But I also had a question
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if you allow me. We&#39;ve talked about and
you guys extensively shed a light on the
crisis that is the young men u in Ronda
and on the continent and all the
pitfalls of not um of of not being
around these young men and helping them
out. On behalf of young men here, I&#39;m
going to speak as a young father of a
four-year-old boy and many men out here
also are raising boys.
Since Allah seems to have successfully
raised functioning member of society
with his sons, what are the most
practical tips you can share with us
parents here to make sure that our sons
do not contribute to the problem but
rather can contribute to the solution.
Hello, thank you so much and thank you
so much for volunteering. Remember last
time we spoke about this and
the tips
this is me. The tips is
be available. That&#39;s one. Second, have
them as your best and best friend
so that they can&#39;t. Yeah, they will. But
once they start thinking about best
friend or to go and look for a friend,
let them see you first. They will always
go to their friend. But once they have
the best friend from home, they will
always feel like I want to be home. an
example, you know this
the new movie that come that may come
I did once we I took all of them and I
realized that it was a very expensive
and and so the next movie coming out
actually that was Wakanda I told him I
said you know what you just chill we
watch this movie at home when it started
being available I told him so let&#39;s be
at home
movie equals to to to to
Uh, popcorn.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Popcorns.
Movie means popcorns and Coca-Cola.
So, okay. So, what do we do? So, I bring
my projector.
I connect to my laptop, one of the
walls. Now, you understand that the DG
at home, she was not happy. So, everyone
turn the the sofa the way you want.
changing the way you want and bring that
whole Coca-Cola of 2,500
and popcorns of 1,000. So everyone get
his post. I said actually this is more
interesting. We are watching movie
together on our wall. So why are we
always going out? So you start bringing
them tactically, bringing them closer to
you. So you you play football even if
you are not that good one but at least
you you you make sure you are everywhere
with them. So whenever they think about
friends they can always go to their
friend but the best friend is at home.
That&#39;s the only way otherwise with
social media with best and best those
called best friend. Yeah to bring them
back will be difficult.
Thank you. I I I want to again, Junior,
we are literally the same age. I want a
young person,
a young man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Introduce yourself and and and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thank you. Do I have to stand up or I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, no, no.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. Uh my name is Brian Karas.
Uh in a few words, I&#39;m a big fan of the
Longform Podcast.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s how I find myself here. And I bet
that Junior isn&#39;t younger than me.
Yeah, cuz as now as per now I&#39;m not yet
married. I&#39;m in my 20s. So, uh I&#39;m just
here to ask questions
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; although I&#39;m not complaining. The fact
that you ask questions is the fact shows
that you have understood something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um I want to ask Mr. Numa u
when we talk about the problem of boys
failing on their duties of upholding
these values of masculinity uh
from my perspective I think it&#39;s
basically a problem of mindset a mindset
which is driven by a lot of things
cultural values uh there are these short
proverbs in kinaranda that sometimes may
support or justify their actions I would
like to give one example there is this
proverb in kinyanda we
you you will always find young men when
they are mistaken or they have committed
crimes or and all sorts of iniquities
trying to defend themselves saying
this was the only choice when they go to
drink alcohol when they when they engage
in irresponsible sexual behaviors. So I
would like to ask you, would you point
out different kinds of uh mentalities or
that are completely misguiding young
people, especially young men?
Yeah. Point them out and give us
alternative uh alternative uh how can I
call it alternative ideas that can guide
us so that we can continue upholding
these uh values of responsible man. And
another thing I would like to request
you is that since you have undertaken
this task of uh training young boys to
become responsible men. There is a
problem of uh young men who are in their
20s in the transition from adolescence
to adulthood.
So that is another class of young people
that needs to be taken care of seriously
because if I have heard you well you&#39;re
focusing on people in the age of 16 they
are still teenagers but also if possible
God willing you can also think of uh
dealing with these young men cuz they
are at universities where they are
living their private lives they have
left their best friends at home they are
now with their friends so shows the need
of actually
being around with them and trying to
shape them into a responsible young men.
Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You
as as I started uh putting it is
a young boy grow up knowing that yes,
you&#39;re the man.
To know that even if he does those, he&#39;s
still a man. And that&#39;s one of the
That&#39;s how I think and I strongly
that&#39;s how even the country created the
itto in Gando so that a lot of people
can go through those ones and they get
the the the refresher on the culture and
how a Rondan man, woman or how you need
to live the Rondan values. I think
that&#39;s why uh one of the the best thing
we have now in the country is to to have
those in Gando to for for all of us to
to refresh her
but again as you are saying
one of the comment from parents feedback
was like I say you know what we will end
up empower those boys even more
or better than us you should break and
start taking us as parent first of all
before taking the boys so that at least
we are on the same level because
sometimes they come back and you find we
are we have already a gap they are they
already here with you as a parent as a
father you are not yet there so what my
suggestion is yes we have that the
background those background that&#39;s how
we used to live
you you you can come back hat or you
even don&#39;t come back no one will ask you
why those those were those years yes but
I don&#39;t think now
another point is thinking about
someone else can do this because a boy
now of 18 years will we will box you in
the camp
but as you are saying you see now that
that was me what what I got as a
revelation.
Honorable Francis, we we do we do work
with government. I I informed them. I
have support from M. Prof, NCDA.
Now this year, Minister of Youth, they
were like even if they are not yet
ready, they are not yet youth. But at
least we realize that there is also a
gap from 16 years to 18. That gap where
where do they belong to? who who talks
to them because they&#39;re already men and
it&#39;s let me say it it&#39;s too late. If
you&#39;re already in 18 to bring you back
because 18 that&#39;s where you are in in in
a junction you either take this road or
this way and once you take this bad
direction to bring you back it will be
difficult to uh parents not even parents
but even security organs. So that&#39;s the
situation. It&#39;s there but we need to
talk about it. We need to stand up and
talk about it. The issue is there. So
everyone it&#39;s everyone&#39;s
role I mean right to to stand up and
address these issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But he also asked another question. Uh
he talked about
negative random sayings that men use to
justify their quote unquote mafuti. I I
see some older people maybe uh
who can uh muse and I mean um
is there we know a lot of negative
sayings that Ben will justify to become
bad men. Are there any runan sayings
that are that create a good man that we
can use to to celebrate good decision
making, responsibility,
soberness?
Thank you. Thank you, Sunny. Maybe I&#39;ll
just try to respond to what the
direction in which the question is
coming but also add some other thoughts.
But the the saying of
the other sayings
something but I don&#39;t remember it very
well about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; something like that but I think it&#39;s
it&#39;s because of the way the society
makeup was and the world has changed and
moved on. Um
I think those days it was a way of
glorifying men and why they who they are
the leaders of the family the defenders
of family and society but um I think
we&#39;ve moved on but the others that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what does that mean you know can mean
I&#39;m not an expert in
language But uh if some some somebody
who who promotes noble causes, generous,
noble, you know, so people are happier
when you when you pardon integrity,
people are happy when you when you refer
to them like that.
Um so there there are other there are
other words that uh even saying you know
even for women
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think it&#39;s uh it&#39;s something that
people are pro and I think those are
even more than the ones that have
negative meaning
but if you allow um
my my my take is that from what I was
hearing from Norma
is that um when he was telling us how he
formed the government and giving
responsibility to
to madame children.
I think children these days
have a lot of young young men for that
matter even women for that matter young
think sometimes there&#39;s
certain basics covered
and I think the things that excite them
the the goals
you know if children are not You give a
a small example of making their bed
something to wake up to.
What are their goals? If you take your
children to the farm or your workplace
and they see what what what you&#39;re
doing. Unfortunately, Dr. has left, but
she was telling us simple things like
her children seeing her and her husband
working on a budget, how how how they&#39;ll
spend the money and how it came in to
give them a sense of responsibility
and knowing that things don&#39;t come easy.
So when when these kids I think don&#39;t
have something exciting and a goal to to
aim for,
I think they look for something else.
And um that&#39;s when you find the mind
idle and an idol mind is is prone to be
distracted to whatever
that may not be right.
So I&#39;m thinking that uh
we end up having a situation where
we are doing more preventive methods of
correcting things that have gone wrong
because we&#39;ve forgotten to do
uh to do to avoid
uh we we are doing curative rather than
preventive. We we are trying to cure
something that&#39;s gone wrong but all
along it&#39;s been progressing. It&#39;s
doesn&#39;t come overnight.
The same way they talk about education
going wrong, it does not go wrong
overnight and you don&#39;t get it right
overnight. It&#39;s a process. And I think
it&#39;s important to know that um
that um it&#39;s a process. I don&#39;t know if
you you&#39;re confident with Ro versus Wade
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and how um
in the US they were giving credit to
this mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani for
preventing crime and there was a big
um about
how do you give him credit for
controlling crime in New York when he
was mayor and the debate was that when
he became mayor and you work backwards
The kids who were in their 20s at that
time when he was mayor that were the
candidates for crime for criminals,
they were not there because that the
ruling about
about u abortion and all that had
eliminated
children that were coming to this world
without with parents who are not ready
to look after them.
And it&#39;s a process and to realize that
reduced crime takes so many years that
um that we need to understand that no
may do what he&#39;s doing. Many people can
do what they&#39;re doing to to to cure the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But I think the parents ourselves
need to be given guidance, advice and to
be talked to about how to prevent
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on a day-to-day basis.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. in schools,
in schools, in homes. I think I like
what you&#39;re doing. I wish I could do
what you&#39;re doing, but I think we need
to also focus more on
the the parents, the peers,
the caretakers, the the the schools to
work on this on a daily basis and make
sure that we have shows that that kids
look up to that that give them
excitement. That&#39;s why sports is
important. It creates competition. You
become competitive. You look forward to
a game tomorrow. But an idol mind will
look for something else that will take
their attention from Tik Tok and
Instagram and anything else.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you&#39;re 100% right. Um there is uh
I I invited some fellow podcasters from
both the region, so from Uganda and on
and from Ronda. There&#39;s uh there are two
young men in Rhonda who are extremely
interesting. Is Joel here
Can you stand up? I I can barely see
you. How you doing? He has one of the
funniest uh podcasts. It&#39;s him and
another young man.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh it&#39;s my co-host Lantry. unfortunately
had a last minute meeting so he couldn&#39;t
join us today.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. So, so one of the you obviously
young men and one of the things that you
keep talking about is drinking. There&#39;s
a po there was a episode that you were
talking about you&#39;re drinking all the
time. All we do is drink. We drink
drink. We We go for weddings. We&#39;re
drinking. We go to parties. We&#39;re
drinking. Uh we hang out with friends.
Everything it seems revolves around
drinking. you were before you came back
uh you were living in Australia which is
a huge right? No, it was Japan. I mean
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? There you go. Um, and
there was a different culture there. I
would want to know
if one, this topic that we had today, if
as young men, right, you&#39;re in your 20s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
Do you guys do young men sit down?
Unfortunately, probably drinking again,
but are you sitting down and saying and
discussing this issue that hey, what is
happening with us?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, it depends on the group of guys.
Amongst my friends, we generally push
each other to like go to the gym, try to
make money, improve ourselves, but
amongst other groups of men, it&#39;s um
they&#39;re still stuck in that age. I call
it when you&#39;re between the ages of 18 to
25, whether you&#39;re a man or a woman, I
think it&#39;s excusable to be doing, it&#39;s
perfectly all right to be doing stupid
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But then when you reach a certain age,
you have to grow up and go, I think it&#39;s
time I grow up and do that. But some men
are still 35 years old and going to the
club every day like they&#39;re 21 when they
shouldn&#39;t be. They should have a family,
be doing something meaningful. So, it
really depends on the group of men and
where they come from and what the
their their goals are, right? Cuz birds
of a feather flock together.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh so what changed your mind? Right. So
you&#39;re saying that, you know, you had
your time and then something,
you know?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Switched. What was that thing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was the same people, the same things,
nothing new. It got to the point like I
think everyone has noticed here like
when you go out with your friends
continuously. You start noticing
everyone&#39;s dress code and you&#39;re like
I&#39;ve seen every clothes that he has in
his wardrobe and you go like what&#39;s the
point of this. Don&#39;t get it twisted. I
still do go out with my friends and
drink and we have fun. But we find that
it&#39;s fun when we do it like two or three
times a month and we keep it to a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh for me it was I just got tired of it.
I wanted to achieve something of note
with my life.
uh something great not just be sitting
around drinking with the same people
having the same old boring conversations
from Monday to Friday.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fantastic. Thank you. I&#39;d like to
have there&#39;s someone from Uganda
uh a friend of mine
stand up. He&#39;s uh from also an amazing
podcast. Uh give him a mic. He can talk
about his podcast. And then I&#39;m going to
ask you,
is this issue that we&#39;re talking about,
which is I guess the male emergency,
is it something that you also see
manifesting in Uganda?
Thank you, Sunonny. And uh good evening
everyone. My name is Simon Casiat.
I indeed a fellow podcaster like Sunny
over there. I co-host a podcast aptly
named Grab a Coffee. Not a whiskey or a
beer, but grab a coffee. And I co-host
it with my friend Raymon who
unfortunately is still on the way from
the airport perhaps to make it here in
I also must make a disclaimer that I&#39;m
not a young man as I may appear. I&#39;m
clocking into 50 very soon. Uhhuh.
Jeanlude Gaga is over here. He can
testify. I&#39;m very surprised to see him
in the audience. I am a father of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes,
I take these matters a bit seriously
and three of those five are young men.
Their names may sound familiar to the
names you call your children. My first
boy is called Kian Kamanzi. The second
one is Keith Kimera and the third is Kai
I am a firstborn of five
and like I have said here I am. You ask
a very important question and the
discussion is incredible and I must
allay the fears in this room that this
conversation and this problem as you may
want to put it is not exclusive to
Randa. Matter of fact we have it back
home. Matter of fact some of us have
lived it. Matter of fact, many of us are
grappling with it. A matter of fact, it
also remains in some cases a hashed up
conversation in our society. Now, what
brings about it? I&#39;ll just give you the
Ugandan perspective. I will not go back
into our history as Uganda, but I&#39;ll
just bring it closer to the maybe the
last 40 years because that I&#39;ve seen
with my own eyes and experienced it.
We&#39;ve had some bit of relative peace
across board. And so you&#39;ve seen
development take its course. You&#39;ve seen
working parents getting into the middle
And for a moment because of the busy
schedules they have not quite being
present for their children across board.
That&#39;s you can park that. But then
secondly, you see
at the beginning of the last 40 years a
wave of devastation caused by HIV and
AIDS. So you begin to see young parents
dying and leaving childled families.
you also pack that.
The last 40 years also came in with not
just a new government but a new
government program that was geared
towards affirmative action for women
basing on the women rights movement. And
so you saw a lot of concerted effort
both in government and in the private
sector going to sprucing the girl child
because for the longest time the girl
child was left behind in all facets of
our development from education access to
health care and even just being seen and
heard. But unfortunately and I&#39;ll start
with that that effort seemed to have
taken quite a big a bit of a buzz and
the boy child started taking the back
seat because the society assumed the boy
child was fine. And like Numa did say in
his opening remarks he&#39;s heard of bridal
showers. Now we can even take it beyond
that that you have the auntie of a young
girl preparing her to get married. I do
not know whether here you have the
equivalent of an uncle of a young man
preparing him to get married. So many of
us as young men get into this life
without an operational manual. So you
just dive right into it and start doing
things by copy and paste. Now depending
on who you&#39;re looking at, that&#39;s what
exactly you will face.
Now 40 years ago, you have either widows
or child- headed families. So the
widows, yes it&#39;s not aified title, but
it&#39;s a woman that has lost her husband
and is raising children. So the children
don&#39;t have a father figure. Today you
have the phenomena of single parents,
many of whom are ladies not because the
fathers of their children have died.
They are alive somewhere but have
absconded any form of personal
responsibility towards their own
children and their partners that they
should be staying together as a family.
What brings about that? That&#39;s a long
conversation. Could be here all night
long. But what I can tell you is there
has been as a result of there not being
enough concerted efforts to letting boys
man up and take responsibility of their
actions of their lives. So many of them
are pumped their middle by their middle
class parents who said I walked 10
kilometers to go to school. So I think
my children don&#39;t deserve to go through
the disonor
of walking to school or living outside a
non-gated community. So we start to
spoil our children and allow them very
little space for socialization for them
to actually do some menu work that in in
itself inculcates in them the spirit of
work and responsibility. So you start
having maids raising your boy child
because you don&#39;t want your child to
wash his underwear, to polish his shoes,
you don&#39;t want him to walk to school.
And as they grow into men, they begin to
think that life is going to give them
the things on a silver platter. So when
they get into the employment world,
working at MTN and other places, AEL,
they would expect that they would be
that kind of chaperon somewhere who&#39;s
going to say, &#34;Hey, clean up your desk
or anything.&#34; So they become
dysfunctional. And when they marry these
wonderful women for wives, they expect
them to be that person that perhaps
performs the role of their mothers of
clean. You know, you you you marry
because you think it is the cheapest way
to get your laundry done and your food
warmed at we hours of the night. So it
eventually becomes a spiral effect. I
will conclude my remarks by saying how
then is the situation today? Numa, you
have a counterpart in Uganda trying to
do a boy&#39;s mentorship.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Joffrey,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know him. I&#39;m glad you know him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And he is trying to bring the values of
a young man into the ethos of our
society. Yes, Uganda is a bit different
from you here. We have 54 um ethnic
groups. My wife and I cannot speak to
each other in our local languages. I can
understand Spanish a little easier than
understand my wife&#39;s local language when
she speaks it. We are all Ugandans.
But the thread that joins us all
together as Ugandans is that there are
certain basic minimums in terms of
ethos, ethics and ways of life that
govern us as an African society. So what
Godfrey is doing is trying to say
whatever it is, we are not going to
allow our children be raised on the
ethos of those places that have brought
one to us Tik Tok and other forms of
social media. We&#39;re going to raise them
with our traditional African values
which is respect for self, respect for
elders, cleanliness, respect for fellow
people and take it to that level. So
there is that concerted effort going in
and we are seeing some results coming
but it&#39;s going to be a long haul as the
gentleman over there saying it is going
to take a long period of time but also
there&#39;s conversations going on at home
that you&#39;re not going to correct
unfortunately it&#39;s going to be very hard
for you no correct a 16year-old who has
had a very bad foundation at home and so
parents are being encouraged and told
you&#39;re not going to allow the television
the maids and the schools parent your
children you have to be present and
parent them from there otherwise you
will have a generation who moral compass
whose moral compass you cannot give very
finally now also take it personally to
myself I was born again close 50 years
ago in Kala to a middle class parentage
my I learned my local language when I
was close to 12 no I was actually at 13
as a teenager just my local language
meaning I was socialized in an
environment where we spoke English. Yes,
you heard that your parents spoke a
certain local language that possibly
resembles another neighbor but that was
not something that we picked up because
we were occasion to speak the unifying
language since we are many speaking
different languages and my father made a
deliberate choice. I remember making a
choice to go to secondary school to an
urban secondary school somewhere in Kala
where I would have continued with my
life of being with my fellow today you&#39;d
call them genius but then were
privileged young uh children born from
privileged families and my father made a
deliberate decision said no you are
going to a secondary school closer to
our home where you will begin to learn
how people of your tribe conduct
themselves outside the classroom. And so
he shipped me off to a school called Nar
School in Barara.
And I must say, S without a fear of
contradiction that the best four years
of my life were spent in that school. I
learned so many things. I learned the
fact that one I picked my identity,
learned the local language because not
knowing your local language in that
society school, you are frowned upon.
You are looked at as someone that is so
exotic and quite out of touch with the
reality. But most importantly, I began
to realize that the benin does not
belong to me alone. That we have to
share. So you take this the sense of
responsibility. Know that the sharing
sometimes bordered on being stolen from
because once you left your shirt there,
someone else borrowed it and the other
borrowed it and the other one took it.
And if it&#39;s down to the 10th person,
you&#39;ll never find it. And you&#39;re also
doing the same to someone&#39;s trousers,
someone&#39;s shoes and the like. So
eventually because of that kind of
jungle existence, we learned the art of
responsibility, taking care of your
property. Because when you go back home,
your parents asked you, &#34;Where are the
shoes you left this place with?&#34; or &#34;How
come you have showed up with brown shoes
yet you left with black shoes? Can you
show evidence that you bleached them or
changed their color?&#34;
And I realized that had it not been for
my parents&#39;
personal decision to ship me off to that
school that gave me that kind of boot
camp engagement, perhaps I would not
have turned out to be the kind of person
that you, Sunonny, are proud to invite
for the live filming of your podcast. I
would be somewhere blasting away
drinking. And matter of fact, let me not
say I am the best father can ever be.
No, I used to have my struggles in that
field. I can&#39;t also say I&#39;m the best
moral example to show. But at least I
can say I am self-aware and matter of
fact I may be clocking into 50 but
you&#39;ll be surprised in my heart and feel
I feel like I&#39;m 20. I don&#39;t know whether
that&#39;s a good thing or whether that&#39;s
leading me to different places but
you&#39;re as old as you are. I hope I have
made uh a contribution that is worth
your time. Thank you very much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. Thank you. So the last last
person that I would love to say
something is a lady
because I want to hear a viewpoint
we are your brothers, we are your
fathers, we are your sons, we are your
Thank you.
Hi everyone. My name is Julian Martha.
Pastor Numa. So, I&#39;m so glad to meet you
We met
uh for a short time
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; earlier this year. Talking Boychild. I
came here because I&#39;m specifically
interested in the Boychild conversation.
I founded a foundation called Julian Boy
Foundation in 2016. I was still young. I
was still in school. I started it
because I almost lost my brother to
Uh we had lost my dad at an early age
who was still teenagers and my brother
is the last born and
he&#39;s the only brother we have at home
and all our relatives took care of us
took us to school made sure we are okay
the girls and I remember one of our
relatives saying
is a boy he will figure life out
um my mom was depressed as a mother. She
didn&#39;t know what to do with us. We were
still young. Uh, one day I&#39;m called to
school and the school wanted to expel my
brother. They had a list of issues that
he had and he feared to call mom because
at that time she had pressure and
diabetes. She called me. Sorry, he
called me.
I get to school and the teachers are
giving me a list of things he has been
doing. drinking drugs, not attending
class, staying in the dometry and all
and all and all. And my reaction as a
big sister was to give him a very hot
And then teachers give us a private time
to talk and then I get to to find out
what is it really that what why are not
why are you not going to class? You
know, we are now like half orphans. We
only have mom. She&#39;s sickly. like what
are you doing with your life and my
brother said you know the problem is
that you also handle me like the rest
like the teachers in fact I was not
planning to go home after this like
after I received the letter of expulsion
and then
my brother was sick his tummy was
swollen no one knew at school he
actually was planning to commit suicide
because he knew that to go home home
will be worse than than school. And me
realizing that I&#39;m like we almost lost
the only man we are left with in the
Uh and his reason was no one understands
him. No one listens to him. No one wants
to know. Uh in my head I&#39;m like
young boys. But when I dug deep, I
realized that he was suffering with low
self-esteem, lack of identity. Dad died
before he became a teenager. So he
didn&#39;t know much about being a man,
being a whatever. Our uncles were
literally very busy man. Like he didn&#39;t
have a father, sorry, a father figure,
anyone to look up to. And all he has is
pressure. We expect him to be like
daddy. He&#39;s the only man we left with.
All relatives expect him to be like our
dad, heir of this and that. You have to
continue the lineage and he doesn&#39;t even
know what that means.
When I walked a journey with my brother,
he was sick. He couldn&#39;t go to the
toilet. He could he was too he was too
sick and he didn&#39;t want to become a
burden to us. Only we realized we almost
lost him. When I walked a journey with
him, tried to understand him, listening
to him, looking at life from his
perspective, he actually felt he had
understood and for the first time we
became friends and he started bringing
me his friends. Every now and then he
would tell me, you remember my friend,
he&#39;s now in rehab. Can we visit him? And
then he would tell his friends, when my
sister meets you, she will somehow talk
to you and you&#39;ll be fine. So he would
bombard me with his friends and one
thing led to another. Every holiday I
found myself talking to these young
boys, teenagers
and going to rehabilitation centers to
volunteer to talk to them. Some were
young fathers that had had denied
children and after talking to them they
realized okay I&#39;m also continuing this
this uh I&#39;m becoming the father that I
was the father that raised me. Little by
little, we started uh reconciling these
young boys with their fathers and
with no experience teaching them what a
man should be like, taking
responsibility, being accountable,
changing mindset and all and praying
with them
and and that&#39;s where Julian Boy
Foundation started and that was way back
in Uganda until I moved here. Um when
I&#39;m I like these conversations and
that&#39;s why when I saw this on Instagram
that&#39;s why I came because I like
hearing. What about men? There&#39;s a
question uh Mr. Suni that you asked.
What is the implication of neglecting
the boy child? What does it have to n to
on a national level? And as someone
pastor Num has been called to the boys
of the elite. I think me it&#39;s the
opposite. I go to the streets to mukiro.
Yeah. That&#39;s where the boys that that
are messing our societies come from.
Boys as as young as seven doing drugs.
They are sleeping next to a trench that
is very very dirty. And you ask them,
&#34;Who are you? Where are your parents?&#34;
He says, &#34;My father is in prison. My mom
drinks to sleep.&#34; Like that those kind
of families. And these are young men.
And this is what I&#39;ve realized. These
young men, they don&#39;t know what life.
That&#39;s the life they know. But that does
not stop them from being men. even if
they are they they are 14 15 but
sleeping with b girls and producing
children and I realized that when we
don&#39;t take care of the boys because by
virtue of the fact that men carry seed
for the next generation the more these
boys are not educated about a fiveinut
form of excitement can create a human
being and these boys do these things
things for fun before you know it they
they&#39;re producing more street kids and
more like the cycle is continuing and
it&#39;s so sad to look at and as a young
woman I I don&#39;t have much experience but
I know that the need is huge and the
more we close our eyes to it the the
bigger it becomes and we may be like ah
my kids are well off but
it might be the the person breaking into
your house next day next day the person.
You know, like any issue concerning the
boy child should be a national issue and
it should concern everyone, male or
female, young or old, because it&#39;s as
urgent as life itself.
Thank you so much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s an amazing way to end this
conversation.
