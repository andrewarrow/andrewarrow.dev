<li>The speaker discovered at age 40 that most people see mental images in their heads, which they cannot do</li>
<li>They have aphantasia - the inability to create mental visual imagery</li>
<li>They also lack an inner monologue and their mind is generally quiet</li>
<li>They cannot visualize loved ones, including their own children and husband</li>
<li>They read 150 books per year but cannot see any mental imagery while reading</li>
<li>They cannot recall smells or tastes when thinking about them</li>
<li>Dreams are experienced as feelings rather than visual images</li>
<li>They have excellent memory for events and actions but struggle with specific visual details</li>
<li>All memories feel equally vivid/vague regardless of when they occurred</li>
<li>They can get songs stuck in their head, sung by the original artists' voices</li>
<li>The discovery was emotionally devastating and led to an existential crisis</li>
<li>They describe their thinking like an old computer that outputs information cards rather than visual displays</li>
<li>Speech feels automatic like muscle memory rather than being consciously constructed</li>
<li>They encourage others with aphantasia to grieve the loss and seek support</li>
<li>The star visualization test isn't perfect - visualization exists on a spectrum</li>
<li>Some people with aphantasia still have inner monologue, while others don't</li>

hi everyone um so I&#39;ve just started this
channel to kind of share some
information about me and something I&#39;ve
learned about myself and if you&#39;ve made
your way here it&#39;s either you just went
online and you found out about people
that don&#39;t have an inner monologue or
people who don&#39;t see pictures in their
heads or if somebody like me who a week
ago found out people see pictures in
their head and they&#39;re not a crazy
person in a movie um yes so last week
there was a tweet going around saying
something about like oh did you know
there&#39;s people that you know don&#39;t have
an inner monologue they don&#39;t talk to
themselves in their head and I was on
Reddit and I saw this thread and of
course you know reddit ruined my life
not just kidding um so there was this
thread talking about it you know people
talking about if they had an inner
monologue or not and I went there
because I don&#39;t have one and I thought
it would be interesting to hear people
yeah how do you deal with a voice in
your head I have no idea but anyway so I
thought it would be cool to just read
about and as I&#39;m going through it
somebody said well let me really blow
your mind there&#39;s people out there you
don&#39;t see pictures in their head what I
have never in my life heard anything
that like was gonna make my head explode
more than that people out there see
pictures in their head I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
even understand how this is this is
possible to me it sounds like a
superhero power you guys are all
superheroes and I&#39;m like the last non
x-men on the planet I you know there was
this lovely article written by I really
forget his name but I&#39;ll link it below
he was one of the founders of Firefox
and and he wrote this thing cuz he has a
Fantasia and and I read it and I&#39;m like
that&#39;s me
um it was so emotional to to to read
that and to learn this about yourself
because you know I I&#39;ve heard things my
life you know like picture this imagine
in your head
but I thought everybody was imagining
things the way I do um you know now it
dawns on me you know image is an
imagination you know um yeah so I
thought everybody it was just this this
idea you know like when you know if
you&#39;d go somewhere they&#39;d say like oh
think of a beach I thought it was just a
way to help you feel relaxed you know
get that beach state of mind right
you&#39;re sitting on the beach and you&#39;re
not stressed about stuff I didn&#39;t think
people were actually seeing a beach yeah
imagining people naked when you give a
speech you guys are sick though honestly
I it never dawned on me that they were
actually that you guys can actually do
this this thing so so the first day when
I heard it first I thought it was a hoax
I still kind of think it&#39;s a hoax
because I still don&#39;t understand how it
works at first I thought it was a hoax
and then when I started reading more and
more and more I definitely was very
upset it is very tragic to find out that
you were missing out on almost
fundamental human experience that you
had never heard of that you didn&#39;t
realize what was happening yeah it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you woke up tomorrow
and you went downstairs and your mom was
like you know it&#39;s cute you keep sending
me these text messages but can you just
use your telepathy to talk to me and
you&#39;re like what what are you talking
about you can use to let the thing and
and and that&#39;s how it feels for me
honestly it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I woke up
and like you know um yes it&#39;s hard and
it&#39;s tragic
I think for me the hardest thing
have been one I don&#39;t have the memories
of my loved ones you guys get to have um
I can think about my kids I can think
about my husband I know I know you know
I have it&#39;s like my brain has all of
their characteristics in it so I can
tell you you know what color hair they
have what color I they have you know
this kind of thing but I can&#39;t picture
them honestly I can&#39;t even picture
myself if I&#39;m not looking in a camera or
a mirror I have no idea what I look like
either and in fact when I was younger I
would almost look at a picture um yeah
so it&#39;s hard knowing that like there&#39;s
everybody else that means my kids has a
more vivid memory of them than I do so
that that&#39;s really that&#39;s really hard
the other one is books I&#39;m so jealous
you know you guys read and you get to
see you get to see it like I&#39;m I&#39;m a
voracious reader like I read I read 150
books last year and I didn&#39;t see any of
it I know what&#39;s going on I read it and
I&#39;m sure what&#39;s going on but I don&#39;t get
movie so I kind of wanted to do this
video in case you know there&#39;s other
people out there like me that just found
out and and and and you&#39;re upset because
I was a mess I actually did this video a
few days ago with a lot more crying so
if you just found out and you&#39;re really
sad I just want you to know like I&#39;ve
been there and I still I still feel loss
and and you should be able to to grieve
however you want to grieve you know like
sometimes when you talk to people about
this problem
they might not believe it or they might
say it&#39;s no big deal but but it is you
know I I went through kind of this
existential crisis like what it means to
be here
and what humanity is because I&#39;m missing
out on something that like nearly every
other humans brain can do and one can&#39;t
do so it led to a lot of questions about
my existence and and what&#39;s going to
happen so if you&#39;re having an
existential crisis I totally understand
but it it does get better I&#39;m still sad
about it I&#39;m still crazy jealous about
it but I don&#39;t want to go live in a
cabin in the woods anymore which it was
kind of my first thought like I&#39;ll just
run off and disappear because this is
so it does get better if you need people
to talk to there&#39;s a lovely group on
Facebook if you just search for a
fantasia you&#39;ll find it or if you want
to email me or message me here totally
cool because I know it&#39;s really it&#39;s
really hard so so that&#39;s the first thing
I just wanted to kind of share my
feelings about finding out the next
thing is I think right now going around
the Internet is kind of that a Fantasia
star test and maybe you found maybe
you&#39;ve found this video because you took
that start chest and you didn&#39;t see the
star it&#39;s not a perfect it&#39;s not a
perfect test I some people that I&#39;ve
talked to they kind of think like when
you close your eyes and think of the
star you&#39;re supposed to see it kind of
on your eyelids and it&#39;s not necessarily
the case it seems like there&#39;s quite a
spectrum for how you guys visualize I
was talking my husband about it cuz I
honestly I can&#39;t wrap my head around it
at all he said like when he visualizes
it&#39;s like he sees it behind his eyeballs
does that help you so like if you if you
think about the star you don&#39;t have to
have your eyes closed to see it if your
eyes are open and you think about it do
you like see it behind your eyeballs
another one is like if you if I tell you
think about your dream house what color
is it how many windows does it have you
asked me to do this tonight I don&#39;t see
there&#39;s no visuals if I close my eyes
it&#39;s black I don&#39;t there&#39;s nothing
if you if I tell you think of a dog okay
is it a certain breed what color is it
is it doing something are you seeing
something did you get a flash um even if
you just got a flash then you then you
don&#39;t have a Fantasia I think I think
honestly the biggest thing is if you if
you hear that there&#39;s people out there
who have never seen anything in your
brain and you&#39;re like people see things
in their brain then you might have it
so hopefully that that clears it up I&#39;ve
talked to a few people and it seems like
not everybody is able to project their
visualization so some people have
visualizations that are just centered in
the brain and some people can push it
out there so so just because you can&#39;t
push it out there doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t
have them right if you can still sense
them in your brain then you&#39;re then
you&#39;re still having visualizations
there&#39;s a lot of different kinds or I
shouldn&#39;t say a lot of different kinds
there&#39;s one kind of Fantasia but there&#39;s
there seems to be like a spectrum of
other things that go along with that
Fantasia some of the people that I&#39;ve
that I&#39;ve talked to they don&#39;t see
pictures but they do have the inner
monologue I don&#39;t have the inner
monologue either so my brain is quiet
there&#39;s not I can force myself to have
an inner monologue like if I you know if
I&#39;m preparing for something like maybe
I&#39;m gonna have a meeting with somebody
and I want to make sure I have certain
points but it&#39;s not like I talked to
myself about what I&#39;m gonna say I like
say something and then like it wasn&#39;t so
good I need to fix it like this all I
hear is exactly what I want to say and
then when I go to do it later I&#39;ll say
the same thing I don&#39;t like adjust it in
my head I&#39;m not like doing work on what
I&#39;m going to say in my head yeah
everything&#39;s very abstract I guess okay
if I ask you how are you today
you just go sampling
right even if you&#39;re not fine you&#39;re
just gonna say I&#39;m fun because we&#39;re
like it&#39;s like muscle memory free for
your mouth I guess right so they ask you
that you just say I&#39;m fine
or if somebody act like what color your
eyes blue you don&#39;t you don&#39;t think
about it it&#39;s just their knee and you
say it that&#39;s me for everything I say so
I&#39;m never working out what I&#39;m going to
say in my head that never happens I
think I&#39;m trying to think of like an
analogy that would help because
apparently the way I think is very
different and the the best I&#39;ve come up
with so far if I think of something
better I will share it but I&#39;m the best
I can come up with is you know like in
the you know 50s they had you know the
first computers of giant computers like
big huge boxes and there were no
monitors or anything and they had like
this little like keyboard and then they
put in the information they want and it
spits out like the card like that&#39;s all
it spits out it&#39;s just like an index
card with whatever information it&#39;s
supposed to be giving you and and my
brain is like that
my brain is like that that computer and
instead of spitting out a card and just
spitting out the words I want to say so
yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s it when I stop
talking it&#39;s quiet
so I I have that I also I don&#39;t do like
the I can&#39;t like think of a smell or a
taste and remember that how that tastes
like like if you tell me to think of a
banana I don&#39;t picture the banana in my
head and I don&#39;t taste the banana either
so apparently some of you can do that as
well um so I can&#39;t do that um I do get
song stuck in my head and queen is like
the worst I&#39;m always getting those songs
stuck in my head why are they so catchy
I don&#39;t know so I do get the song stuck
in my head and they are sung by the
people who sing them it&#39;s not my voice
singing this song apparently that&#39;s the
thing whose voice it is it sings it I
also don&#39;t dream in pictures or at least
if I do
I&#39;ve never remembered one so I haven&#39;t
actually remembered him in a real
really long time cuz I have two kids
under five so like I don&#39;t really sleep
but um yeah when I remember a dream it&#39;s
more like a feeling like how maybe a
dream where you&#39;re falling like I&#39;ll
wake up with that you know like your
heart beating and like you know like I
woke up just in time and I didn&#39;t splat
um but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see the sky or
clouds or the buildings or anything I
just have that feeling or you know like
maybe I was being chased by somebody and
I have that feeling at the back of my
neck right there&#39;s somebody behind you
so that&#39;s how I wake up from a dream as
far back as I can remember I&#39;ve never
dreamed in pictures I&#39;ve never
visualized anything I&#39;m I&#39;m completely
in reality I guess you could say that&#39;s
not to say I don&#39;t have a memory though
there are there are some people I&#39;ve
been learning that have a Fantasia that
are not very good at remembering what
happened to them before I actually
before I found out that you guys all
have pictures in your head I thought I
had a photographic memory and I thought
it was kind of like a metaphor that you
say photographic cuz nobody actually has
a head anyway I&#39;m really good at
remembering things you know I remember
like TV shows I used to watch when I was
a kid I remember driving past our new
home when my dad just bought it and I
was like five years old but I&#39;m not I&#39;m
not seeing the picture what I&#39;m
remembering is that the action I get
everything in like an info dump like if
I try to bring up a memory like think of
something embarrassing and then I get
and it&#39;s all there at one time I&#39;m not
like seeing it play out
it&#39;s just I&#39;ve gotten everything and
then I can tell you oh you know one time
I was walking out of the campus center
in University and it was windy and I had
my head down and I ran into a light pole
and to you it probably sounds like I&#39;m
seeing it in my head and it sounds
pretty detailed but to me it&#39;s kind of
just a foggy mist and I&#39;m just saying
what came out of my brain without really
about it and I will say this the weird
thing about my memories is they&#39;re all
equal intensity or equal vagueness maybe
I should say the things I did this
morning are equal to the things I did 20
years ago like all of all of my memories
are just like this it&#39;s like imagine
it&#39;s like night time in your city and
it&#39;s all in fog so you can&#39;t really see
anything but you know where everything
is you just know it because you&#39;ve been
there so long you know what it is
that&#39;s kind of like how my brain feels
if that makes sense so yes so you can
ask me anything and I can you know I&#39;m
not good like if you said something like
do you remember you know sharees red
dress no I don&#39;t remember it oh do you
remember that time we were out with her
and she spilled that thing on her dress
and well oh I remember that
so something much better with actions
and events than I am with like if you
tell me a specific like a person like
their name or like something like that
then I&#39;m not as good at it but I can
remember events very well so I don&#39;t
know if that&#39;s bizarre or whatever but
yeah that&#39;s how it is
yes of course now I&#39;m like thinking
about all these things that happened to
me when I was young anyway so yeah I
think I&#39;ll I&#39;ll do more videos if you
have questions please ask I&#39;m happy to
talk about it if you need help please
get in touch I&#39;m happy to talk to you
too I think there&#39;s not a lot of
information out about this and I&#39;d like
I&#39;d like to share what I can I mean this
is shock to me I mean I&#39;ve been alive 40
years and I had no idea you guys movies
playing in your head
ah well what are you gonna do yeah so I
think that&#39;s it I wanted to kind of just
give like a little overview that
hopefully it&#39;s helpful hopefully I&#39;ve
explained some things and yeah if I
went to high school with you and I see
you on the street and I don&#39;t remember
you I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s it&#39;s my brain it&#39;s
not me okay all right bye
