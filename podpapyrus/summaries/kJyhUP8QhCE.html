Rampage Jackson&#39;s son, Raja Jackson,
just got into serious trouble. And what
he did was frankly disgusting. So, he&#39;s
just supposed to do a simple wrestling
skit. He was just supposed to bodys slam
the guy in front of him and pull some of
his punches. As you can see, slams him
down and instantly knocks out the guy
and instead of pulling his punches, he
just starts knocking him out, throwing
haymakers non-stop until the guy starts
bleeding. And you can see the wrestlers
behind their shong. I&#39;m not too sure
whether this is part of the
entertainment. Look at the guy at the
back. They just all start coming up,
grabbing him, pulling him away from the
knocked out wrestler. We can see it&#39;s
like bleeding from the corner of his
Yeah. So, it&#39;s a really shocking scene
to see. Yeah. They had to crow him and
pin him into the corner just to stop
him. And it seems like the only reason
why he went all out on the wrestler is
because the same wrestler made fun of
him earlier on. Here&#39;s the clip.
What? You don&#39;t know me?
Hell no. Yeah. Hey, that&#39;s that&#39;s that.
Hey, I think that&#39;s a
Oh, you don&#39;t
is He&#39;s not a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] worker, bro. Calm
Yeah. What What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was that?
You&#39;re good. You&#39;re good. You&#39;re good.
You&#39;re good.
What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was that?
You don&#39;t sell it.
He&#39;s not a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bro.
What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was Hold on. Hold on. Hold
I don&#39;t play that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bro. Sorry.
No, I will [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] him up.
I know. I know you will. We&#39;re good.
We&#39;re good. I will [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
But it turns out that the dude fully
apologized after the confrontation and
even asked Raja if he would like a fake
angle in the wrestling match.
I appreciate it.
I I didn&#39;t know I
get working out. Well, he going to come
out on your mattes. I know you keep
thinking we&#39;re working. We&#39;re always
I get it out now. You
You know what I&#39;m saying? We&#39;re always
So, we&#39;ll set it up. Well, I&#39;ll have him
come out during your mat so we could
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] seal the whole thing and it will
make something out of it. You know what
I&#39;m saying?
All right.
And the reason why he suddenly acted out
was because he was tired of everyone
treating him like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Everybody [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] playing with me and
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Think I&#39;m always playing and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Call me [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Not no [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bro. At the end of the day, I&#39;m a
stand up for my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] self because I&#39;m
tired of everybody [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] playing with
me, bro. Real [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Now Raja is banned
on kick, but it seems like the kick ban
might be the least of his worries as he
was later told that the wrestler he had
attacked had just flatlined and still
hadn&#39;t woken up.
Hey, where the hell you at?
I told you to double that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
and starting. I just saw the video.
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] pissed me off though, Andre.
I understand that. But now they can&#39;t
wake the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up.
He&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in the ring. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
flatline, bro.
My bad.
You didn&#39;t have to do all that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I
understand y&#39;all had he didn&#39;t have to
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] take it.
All right, I&#39;ll call you back later.
Upon hearing that, Raja decided to
immediately end the shrimp. So, here&#39;s a
clip of Rampage Jackson reacting to the
news. So you can see the disbelief in
his face when he hears it.
My son got My son might be getting
arrested or something. Oh yeah. My son
got in a fight at a pro wrestling event.
I&#39;m about to stream. I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be
back. I&#39;ll be back to you.
I&#39;m going go find out. I&#39;m
He left almost immediately trying to
find out what exactly his son had just
done. So the situation is still
developing and if the reports are true,
this could go way beyond a kick ban. And
we are talking lawsuits, jail time, and
maybe even worse. This was just not a
wrestling skit gone wrong. This was
low-key attempted murder. So yeah, like
and subscribe if you want any updates to
this story as it unfolds. And hey, and
hey, if you have any thoughts on the
situation, don&#39;t forget to drop a
comment. Thanks for watching.
