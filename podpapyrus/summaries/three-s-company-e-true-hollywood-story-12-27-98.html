Pacific on the E True Hollywood
Story me move in here with you too mhm
are you serious yeah of course you&#39;ll
have to share everything
gladly in March of 1977 a handsome
Bachelor named Jack Tripper moved into
an apartment with two gorgeous roommates
Janet and Chrissy this simple premise
launched the tele series 3&#39;s company the
show&#39;s liberal dose of sexy escapades
and wild slapstick made it a runaway
smash the network you know come to run
throughs like this only till we were a
top 10 then they were like hi how can we
you a lot of it had to do with sex who
was getting it who wasn&#39;t getting it why
weren&#39;t they getting it how could a guy
live with two girls and not get it for
eight years Three&#39;s Company jiggled and
stumbled its way to top 10 ratings cast
members Suzanne Summer John Ritter and
Joyce DT became International Superstars
but the show&#39;s success created trouble
money trouble she was greedy and there
was no reason for it at the height of
the show&#39;s popularity Suzanne Summers
bitter contract dispute halted
production and threatened to topple the
multi-million doll Enterprise he said we
$150,000 an episode and 10% ownership of
the program in the next 2 hours The E
True Hollywood Story takes you back to
The Swinging 70s to go behind the scenes
of one of the most popular comedies in
television history we did a one act show
every Friday night they were Little Gems
through vintage film clips rare
photographs and in-depth interviews
you&#39;ll learn how The Producers cast and
crew created a loving family that was
ripped apart in a messy divorce it was
really ugly and there were a lot of
tears and for the first time in nearly
20 years Suzanne Summers John Ritter
Joyce dwit and the entire cast reflect
on the show that brought them Fame and
Fortune and the wounds that for some
have yet to heal it
was difficult enough hurtful enough
disappointing enough in terms of
disrespectful treatment that um I did
have to disappear this is the story of
how one popular television show spawned
a Litany of ego and Excess power and
greed this is the story of the meteoric
rise and turbulent run of three company
The E True Hollywood
Story the of being one of her life&#39;s
ambition was to be
[Applause]
a long before Jack Tripper ever tumbled
over a piece of furniture or Chrissy
snow melted Hearts around the world
three swinging singles in Britain were
stirring up controversy in the mid &#39;70s
in a racy comedy called man about the
house in 1975 Don taffner was the US
Representative for British programming
giant Tim&#39;s television taffner thought
man about the house had tremendous
potential as an American Series so he
contacted his partner Ted Bergman I then
presented man about the house to all
three networks ABC CBS and
NBC and all the program Department deps
love the show they thought it was great
but when they took it to their standards
practices censors quote
unquote uh all three had to turn it down
they said you&#39;re not having a man living
with two girls on our Network within
weeks however Fred Silverman became the
new programming Chief at ABC immediately
after he was hired Silverman called
Bergman with a question you still have
that uh
British show with a guy living with two
girls and I said yes he said well I want
to develop it I said well your standards
and practices people have turned it down
he said let me worry about them author
Chris man chronicled the history of
thre&#39;s company in his 1998 book come and
knock on our door it was Fred Silverman
who really was The Mastermind behind it
who knew that this would be the same
breakthrough and sexiness as All in the
Family was and
after one aborted pilot script Silverman
ordered Bergman to hire the best comedy
writer he could find Larry gelbart who
created and wrote and produced mash the
TV version was the hottest writer at the
time Gilbert began writing what he
envisioned would be a sophisticated
comedy casting began in January 1976 on
what was now being called thre company
28-year-old John Ritter son of famed
country musician Tex Ritter was every
body&#39;s first choice to play lovable Jack
Tripper executive producer Donald
taffner when we saw him everybody just
looked around and said that&#39;s the guy it
was just it was amazing I don&#39;t think
I&#39;ve ever done that before you know that
was the guy I didn&#39;t even do that when I
got married Ritter gained National
recognition playing the softs spoken
Reverend fordwick on the TV series The
Waltons I had this little bit that I did
when I was on The Waltons with my
friends you know who were some of them
actors some of them not but I&#39;d say I
can&#39;t go in there because I&#39;ll be mobbed
everyone knows I&#39;m Reverend fordwick
from the Waltons of course no one I knew
watched The Waltons except for my
parents actress Valerie curtain won the
role of Jenny the smart and Sassy
brunette while relative unknown Suzanne
xenor beat out dozens of eager blondes
as the intellectually challenged
Samantha rounding out the cast were
industry veterans Norman Fel and Audra
Lindley as the bickering landlords The
Ropers I read it and I said uh I haven&#39;t
played a lot of comedy you know I was
playing serious stuff and cops and all
kinds of stuff like that so I said I
think this might be fun Larry gelbart
pilot taped in mid-march of
1976 at the time ABC&#39;s West Coast
operations were headed by current Disney
Chief Michael Eisner I went back to
Eisner and Eisner said we don&#39;t like the
girls you&#39;ve got in there uh you have to
make another
pilot and I said you don&#39;t have the
right to make us make another pilot your
only right is to pick up the series for
either the fall or for January for
midseason Ted Bergman was not willing at
first to remake this pilot just so ABC
could sit on it for another season and
so he took the pilot to his friend um
Bud Grant at CBS he wouldn&#39;t let me out
of the office until we screened it for
Bob Daly who was his boss
and at that point they said what do you
want what Bergman wanted and got was a
commitment from CBS to Air 13 episodes
of Three&#39;s Company if ABC passed on its
option Bergman returned to the Beverly
Hills Hotel to call his partner Don
taffner with the good news Fred
Silverman was in the Next Room and
overheard this conversation so it was
very much like thre&#39;s company the next
morning I got a phone call which started
out with where are you I said I&#39;m in the
Beverly Hills Hotel who is this he said
this is Freddy Silverman I&#39;m in the
Beverly Hills Hotel too I said oh that&#39;s
interesting he said what&#39;s going on with
Three&#39;s Company I said well your man
Eisner is giving us a very difficult
time he said well what do you want I
said I want a commitment for midseason
from ABC for the series ABC and the
producers reached to compromise the
network promised to air six episodes but
only if a second pilot was produced with
new female leads since Larry Gilbert&#39;s
contract only called for him to write
one pilot he Departed the project it was
at that point that I brought Nichol Ross
and West into the show Don nickel
Michael Mickey Ross and Bernie West
known as nrw first joined forces while
riding All in the Family for Norman Lear
after creating The Jeffersons they
became hot Commodities in in Hollywood
Bernie West recalls their first pitch
meeting with producer Ted Bergman we sat
around and listened to the uh ideas and
we we I thought it was a a very u a very
good idea you know a young man living
with two women and uh it&#39;s completely
platonic but little uh things come up
that uh uh make it uh provocative nrw
came on board and made an immediate and
drastic change in the style of the show
they saw Three&#39;s Company as pure bedroom
farce loaded with mistaken identities
sexual innuendo and double on tonel not
tonight Helen I got
a they wanted it to be um provocative
certainly but I think they also wanted
it to have youth appeal and I think
that&#39;s what nrw brought to it John
Ritter certainly had the youth appeal
but the writing um became much more
Whimsical and silly after altering the
format nrw set about recasting the women
27-year-old Joyce dwit was offered the
part of Janet Wood without having to
audition DT was under contract to ABC
and was championed by Network head Fred
Silverman Fred wanted John and Fred
wanted me and that&#39;s what was happening
um that&#39;s it was his baby casting the
role of Chrissy snow the naive blonde
proved to be much more challenging the
really attractive young ladies didn&#39;t
didn&#39;t most of them
had lacked the personality to do comedy
a new Chrissy was hired but she was
replaced by actress Susan laner just
days before the second pilot taped on
November 5th
1976 ABC programming Chief Fred
Silverman liked everything about the
second pilot except Susan lanir a
frantic search was launched to find a
new blonde to bring Chrissy to life Fred
Silverman recommended Suzanne Summers he
had seen her on a
one of their hour shows 29-year-old
Suzanne Summers was best known as the
blonde and the teabird in the movie
American Graffiti but Summers had caught
Fred Silverman&#39;s eye in an episode of
stari and Hutch I mean to put it all out
front the marriage broke up because
there was hardly ever a sex scene I mean
not that we we couldn&#39;t get it together
if you know what I mean it&#39;s like um he
goes for gambling the hores basketball
football you know a real Sports freak
and then I get this call from my then
manager who said um there&#39;s this
interview they&#39;re really interested in
you called Threes Company and I said I
really don&#39;t want to go I had decided
that I was leaving the business because
I had uh done nine television pilots in
the Years prior to thre&#39;s company and
all of them failed but Summers did
attend the audition The Producers were
getting desperate without a Chrissy
production would have to be postponed
yet again Fred Silverman said so that&#39;s
that&#39;s a step in the right direction so
rather than we closed down we took
Suzanne Ted Bergman was dubious At first
she could not do comedy she had never
done comedy but Summers had the look and
the naive The Producers were searching
for and she was hired the third Threes
Company pilot was taped on February 11th
1977 the show aired a month later on
March 15th the first week the show
ranked in like the top 30 the second
week it was in the top 10 top top five
it was an enormous hit it was number one
in its time slot so it was an immediate
success and it shocked people because at
that time a mid-season replacement uh
had never done that

three pilots and four Chrissy snows
thre&#39;s company finally debuted on ABC on
March 15th
1977 the show was an instant hit and the
lives of the cast members changed
Forever by 1977 its second season
Three&#39;s Company was consistently ranking
in the neelon top 10 I&#39;ll let you in on
a little scoop today we found out that
the National neelon came in on our first
rerun last Thursday and we were number
[Applause]
National fans Lov the broad physical
comedy and racy double on
Tundras yeah there&#39;s nothing a girl
likes more than a little tickle on the
[Laughter]
tummy actor Paul Angley played the
bartender at the show&#39;s hip Watering
Hole the Regal Beagle a lot of it had to
do with sex who was getting it who
wasn&#39;t getting it why weren&#39;t they
getting it how could a guy live with two
girls and not get it from the two girls
ABC paired the show with another Brash
news series soap on Tuesday nights
critics lambasted the network for
eroding the moral standards of prime
time television Richard Klein played
threes company&#39;s swinging Bachelor Larry
Dallas the critical response to Threes
Company if indeed these people ever saw
more than one episode which they
hadn&#39;t uh was to Pan the show as being a
jiggle show jiggle humor was a thinly
veiled reference to Suzanne summers&#39;s
ample assets when I would do the
character of Chrissy I would get so
within that I would uh lose lose sight
of what my body was doing which was just
so delicious because nothing was ever
planned I remember jumping back and
forth and jumping back and forth and
when I saw it on screen my breasts were
going back and forth and I think that&#39;s
where Queen of the jiggle started author
Chris man I think a lot lot of the
critics misunderstood the show I don&#39;t
think they realized that it was a farce
that the show didn&#39;t take itself
seriously it was a silly farce about
three people living together and I think
the critics made it their Whipping Boy
The public&#39;s support helped ease the
sting of bad reviews the critics hated
this show because it was a show about
nothing a show about nothing that the
public loved and that eventually you
know kicked everybody out of the water
but the attacks didn&#39;t only come from
the outside execs at ABC faced The
Dilemma of airing a wildly successful
show that was getting publicity for all
the wrong reasons our ratings were were
enormous and um but in spite of that the
network had almost an inferiority
complex about the show there was a
little bit of embarrassment because th
company had problems with some
conservative Watchdog groups and was
having problems with some advertisers so
th&#39;s company became ABC&#39;s dark secret
much like Ellen in the 9s because of the
Uproar Network sensors meticulously
scrutinized each episode they were
definitely uh on our backs all the
time and we didn&#39;t have very much muscle
until the show really began to score at
times the scrutiny reached an absurd
level writer producer Kim weop the line
as written
was hey tarzen can I swing from your
Vine and the network says no you can
absolutely cannot say that we we
understood that it was one of those
situations where you were probably going
to trade it off for something and we
said well if we can&#39;t say Vine what can
we say and in their uh wisdom the the
network said
tree tree hi Tarson can I swing from
your tree fine we&#39;ll put that in and uh
and that&#39;s the way that&#39;s the way it was
broadcast but the reviews weren&#39;t all
bad John Ritter&#39;s outrageous physical
comedy impressed the critics and his
co-stars alike he put me away I mean he
has he has all the techniques that
Milton Burl Jerry Lewis Harold Lloyd
Buster Keaton rolled into one Ritter was
a natural Joyce dwit was an experienced
comedian Suzanne Summers however had
never done comedy before I had never
been trained as a comedic actress um I
mean I never been trained for anything
thought she was very raw when she first
started out she knew she was raw Suzanne
credits executive producer Mickey Ross
with helping her develop her comic
timing he taught me to hear the music of
Comedy producers assistant B Dallas they
would like father and daughter and
Mentor student and he realized that he
could help her and teach her even though
I work with her privately for some time
she was very fast and she learned leared
the comedy role very very fast The
Producers may have worked with Suzanne
Summers but they weren&#39;t as
collaborative with Joyce dwit their
interpretation of the character was
so narrow in terms of her style and and
and in opposition to what I believed she
had to be to to make this show
work that um after we finished the first
six I was just sort of praying that you
know this would disappear from my life
and I would never see them again DT
claims The Producers bristled at input
from a female actress on the first or
second day I would make a suggestion
about cutting something or changing
something and they were polite enough to
stop talking while I talked but that was
it that was it then they would just go
right on and it would be ignored it was
very much uh a class system here with
the actors here were the writer
producers and you really didn&#39;t want to
screw around with that too much cuz
could find yourself maybe not working on
the series anymore I&#39;ve learned over
time that uh that a sitcom set is not a
democracy you know not everybody has
equal say they didn&#39;t listen to her
didn&#39;t listen to me either nevertheless
Joyce devised a clever method of getting
her point across I just took John aside
one day and I said if I have a
suggestion I&#39;m going to tell it to you
in secret and private and then I&#39;d say
Joyce has a good point and I agree with
it I don&#39;t know if if it was John&#39;s
presentation or if it was because John
said them and not Joyce there&#39;s some
dispute over that but when John said
them the producer said oh that&#39;s a good
idea as the ratings skyrocketed stardom
quickly overwhelmed the three cast
members no one can ever be prepared for
that kind of Fame it uh it was literally
overnight I was one person on Monday and
on Tuesday I was a different person John
Ritter realized early on that Fame could
be a double-edged sword I was driving
over the hill and I heard that uh Freddy
Prince had put a bullet in his head and
killed himself when those guys were on
Hiatus we were doing the pilot of thre
company and I was in the the star
dressing room that Freddy Prince was so
when I walked in there I went well the
answer certainly isn&#39;t here if I&#39;m
looking for fulfillment if I&#39;m looking
for satisfaction if I&#39;m looking for a
meaning to life it is not being the star
of a sitcom Ritter dwit and Summers had
drastic different reactions to fame
Suzanne wanted to be a star John Ritter
I think really just wanted the laughs he
wanted to do his craft and joy DeWit was
so embarrassed from Fame and shy that
she didn&#39;t want to do any publicity
really at all all of a sudden I was a
public figure someone that was
recognizable and everything about your
life changes then and being a very
private person there was a lot of of
putting the brakes on for me I was like
wait a minute I remember John and Joyce
just staying the way they were I mean
they were excited but I don&#39;t remember
hoopla around them as much as around
Suzanne thre&#39;s company gave Suzanne
Summers her first brush with celebrity
it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting new Hazard you
know do you like it um yeah I think well
I think that&#39;s what you work for all
this time for Suzanne there was no
turning back Suzanne took the first six
weeks pay and went to Jay Bernstein who
was representing feros at majors at the
time and who was the biggest thing on TV
and she said I want you to make me as
visible as Farah it wasn&#39;t just she was
famous she was a
phenomena and once I had um a taste of
success uh there is a businesswoman that
lives inside of me and I thought how far
can we go with this Suzanne&#39;s former
manager Jay Bernstein she had such
enthusiasm and when I said let me think
about it she didn&#39;t give me much time to
think about it she was at me every
day and she just said I can do it I can
do it I can do it Bernstein signed the
eager young actress and set about
maximizing her exposure I took Suzanne
Summer&#39;s career to the next level
because I didn&#39;t care how much money she
made on Three&#39;s Company I wanted wanted
to make certain that she had a foolproof
career that if she was going to fail it
would take her 5 years to do it Chrissy
dolls posters notebooks and memorabilia
soon materialized and Suzanne found her
life being pulled in new and exciting
directions there was so many scripts
that came in that I started piling them
up on the stairs in terms of priority of
what I was going to read next I don&#39;t
know what I turned away I don&#39;t know
what I turned down it didn&#39;t really
matter there&#39;s so much coming at us all
of us Summer&#39;s personal life followed
her career upswing during the second
season Suzanne&#39;s longtime boyfriend
Canadian talk show host Alan Hamill
proposed marriage the couple was married
at their home in Malibu and Hamill
joined Bernstein in guiding Suzanne&#39;s
career I felt in the beginning that I
was making all the career
decisions and that he
was there with Suzanne as part of the
team he let me do it until the time came
where he felt he could do what I was
doing when The E True Hollywood Story
continues the happy family breaks up so
I said I don&#39;t want to do it oh what do
you mean everybody wants to do their own
show and later the laughter stops was
there a renegotiation ploy going on on
yeah was there broken ribs

wrong they are the stories that make you

goes after Three&#39;s Company premiered in
1977 public support won out over
negative views to create a Smash Hit the
co-stars became media Sensations but
jealousy and greed began to rip apart
all they had
built the third season of Three&#39;s
Company saw a host of changes behind the
scenes first veteran television director
Dave Powers was brought in to beef up
the broad physical comedy I would tell
the cast that this is a play it&#39;s in a
prum it&#39;s a play
um don&#39;t worry about cameras when Dave
Powers came in it became more of a
physical farce more farce than bedroom
we can still have it be provocative and
risque but the emphasis is on the
relationship of the characters and the
physical comedy power&#39;s specialty was
shooting quickly to preserve the
spontaneity co-star Richard Klein we
would start the 8:00 taping and be uh at
of makeup by 9:15
and in our little you know Toyotas on
February 14th 1978 thre&#39;s company
reached the Pinnacle of success by
becoming the number one rated show in
America John Ritter noticed a change in
Attitude from Network Executives Network
you know come to runers like this only
till we were at top 10 then they were
like hi how can we serve
you nice backside the heat on the show
was palpable the week the show became
number one the cast received an
unexpected good honor we get the phone
call that um they&#39;re going to put us on
the cover of
Newsweek a sitcom on the cover of
Newsweek the cover shoot was a disaster
however when the photographer showed up
Suzanne was the center focus and John
and Joyce were being asked to pose uh
around her kind of like as atmosphere
the guy kept putting me in the middle
and putting Joyce down here and John up
and I could there was tension on this
shoot like you couldn&#39;t believe it
became clear that they had an agenda and
um it wasn&#39;t an agenda that John or I
were comfortable with and it was a very
uncomfortable experience I called um Don
nickel over and I said what is going I
took him behind the set I said what is
going on I said um it&#39;s like they&#39;re
trying to feature me but uh it&#39;s
creating this horrible thing here and
I&#39;m very uncomfortable and I&#39;m on the
verge of tears and joy is is mad at me
and John&#39;s mad at me and he said they&#39;re
not trying to feature you they&#39;re just
getting different configurations
nevertheless the shoot was ruined
newsweek&#39;s cover assembled under the
provocative headline sex and TV was
eventually pasted together using
existing publicity Stills the Newsweek
experience exposed a raw nerve who was
the real star of Three&#39;s Company John
was the lead Suzanne became the
celebrity and Joyce was the second build
actor and when Suzanne became this
magazine cover girl I think people
perceived some people perceive that she
was the star of the show and the way the
show was written and build that wasn&#39;t
the case just six days after the
contentious photo shoot thre&#39;s company
won the 1978 People&#39;s Choice Award for
favorite comedy series John Ritter and
Suzanne Summers captured individual
awards for favorite male and favorite
female in a new series series most of
America loved the show the religious
right did not one of the most vocal
critics was a southern Minister named
Donald Wildman writer producer George
Burton oh my God remember the Reverend
Wildman he was say oh we can&#39;t allow
this sort of thing to be on TV I mean we
had such problems Donald Wildman uh left
his ministry to start the national
Federation for decency and as we all
know thre company was probably the most
indecent show on TV in history
Wildman&#39;s campaign managed to convince
at least one sponsor Sears to cancel its
advertising John Ritter decided to fight
back when I went on dinos Shore you know
Mike Douglas and tonight&#39;s show and and
I just said you know if those people who
like the shows buy two of everything to
counteract these guys who hate us for
the most part Wildman&#39;s protest fell on
deaf ears Three&#39;s Company was the number
one rated show on television so ABC
decided to capitalize on that success
grece company was so successful that ABC
wanted to do what the British people had
done with man about the house spin off
The Ropers and so they approached Norman
and Audra and Adra wanted to go on and
be the star of their own show Norman
didn&#39;t want that so I said I don&#39;t want
to do it oh what do you mean everybody
wants to do their own show you know I
said well I don&#39;t because this is a big
hit and it&#39;s going to run for six or
eight or year n years or something like
that let me run that out Fel reluctantly
agreed to do the spin-off on one
condition if The Ropers didn&#39;t last a
full season he could return to Three&#39;s
Company talented veterans Patty
McCormack and Jeffrey Tambour joined Fel
and Lindley but The Ropers never found a
solid audience I think The Ropers worked
wonderfully as a b plot on th&#39;s company
but to have the whole show Rev rolve
around you know that one joke that they
weren&#39;t uh getting intimate with each
other eventually wore a little thin
Norman Fel maintains a different
perspective they put us in on
Sunday and I went up to New York when I
found out that it was Sunday and I said
what are you doing to us you&#39;re killing
us after a season and a half of
declining ratings The Ropers was
cancelled I said okay now I can go back
to thre company and the producers an
said we don&#39;t need you now I said yeah
but my deal is that I can go
back they said uh no because you went
past the guarantee with The Ropers out
of the picture The Producers created
Ralph Furley a wacky new landlord to
stir up trouble the question was who
would play him we looked and looked and
looked and we wanted a really good
comedian to play this we wanted
someone like Don knuts we kept saying
someone like Don and then
boing why don&#39;t we get Don nuts as luck
would have it the legendary co-star of
The Andy Griffith Show was ready to
return to series television my manager
called and said uh they wanted me to
come and take Norman F&#39;s place that he
was leaving the show to do a spin off
and they made an offer I was thrilled
knots eagerly slipped into Mr Furley
psychedelic wardrobe Mr Furley was a
wonderfully fun character to do because
you could just go as far out as you
wanted this baby will cut those cuffs
like a hot knife through
butter handling the show&#39;s Breakneck
shooting Pace was a different matter
when I started it was a five-day week
and uh so the kids finally said they
they only wanted to do four days and
that that scared me a little right there
I thought geez I don&#39;t know if I can do
get this together in four four days but
but I adjusted to it not wasn&#39;t the only
newcomer in the fourth season Anne
Wedgeworth joined the cast as Lana
Shields a sexy divorce a with her eye on
Jack Tripper Alana was like
um kind of a force of nature I guess
unfortunately Lana would have the
shortest run of any character in the
show&#39;s history she&#39;s so so beautiful
she&#39;s so sexually appealing and you&#39;ve
got this guy Jack Tripper who you&#39;ve
already you know portrayed as you know
humping lamp posts and uh he&#39;s refusing
this gorgeous woman it it seemed a
little false I mean this is like how
many times can we can we do this uh this
joke you know so they started to cut me
down and cut me down cut me down until
finally they cut Wedgeworth out
executive producer Bernie West it didn&#39;t
work as well as we had hoped and we had
thought so uh so that was it Three&#39;s
Company breezed through its fourth
season on top of the ratings but Suzanne
Summers career outside of the show was
beginning to cause problems according to
Suzanne her manager Jay Bernstein had a
bad relationship with ABC president Fred
Silverman I didn&#39;t realize that Fred
Silverman um had a vendetta against Jay
Bernstein and that when Jay pulled Farah
from Charlie&#39;s Angels that he said
relative to Jay Bernstein let&#39;s smoke
them out let&#39;s not let any of his
clients do anything at our networks
Bernstein alleges that ABC wouldn&#39;t hire
Summers for anything outside of Three&#39;s
Company so he came up with a
revolutionary idea I went to CBS and I
said how would you like to have a su
deal with Suzanne Summers all of Suzanne
Summers movies for television can be
with you CVS all the specials she does
she can host with you and then when
thre&#39;s company&#39;s over she can do a
series with you so it&#39;s announced in the
in the trades that I&#39;ve made this uh
unheard of deal with CBS while I&#39;m still
an ABC uh star and Fred Silverman called
me and screamed at me how could you do
this I gave you a start how could you do
it and I said I tried to call you and he
said well you could have tried harder
and he hung up very angrily Suzanne was
also making a feature film and that too
caused problems and then I did a movie
with Donald southernland that ran 2
weeks long and the three company start
date was moved one season by 2 weeks and
that was another thing that seemed to
rub everybody the wrong way Summer&#39;s
tardiness exacerbated an increasingly
tense situation on the Threes Company
set script supervisor Carol Summers As
Time wore on people just got angry that
they felt very manipulated uh by her
and uh nobody knew nobody knew what she
was doing and
and they just started getting angry
because they wanted to work Summers made
another stunning move in the summer of
1980 she fired her manager Jay Bernstein
Jay always said to me I&#39;m going to get
you up there where the air is rarified
you&#39;ll become deified and then I&#39;ll
become nullified and in essence that&#39;s
what happened stepping into Bernstein&#39;s
place was Suzanne&#39;s husband Alan Hamill
I think by the time Suzanne had become a
very big star and Allan took over
managing that&#39;s when the problem started
to come about because the produc
producers felt that he had too much of
an interest in the business side of
things without knowing too much about
it when The E True Hollywood Story
continues Three&#39;s Company becomes a war
zone the last show that I did um John
and Joyce did not talk the last full

Suzanne Summers felt that she was the
star of Three&#39;s Company and she started
to act like it as her ambition grew a
showdown on the set became
inevitable by 1980 Suzanne Summers John
Ritter and Joyce dwit were earning
substantial weekly salaries when we saw
we had a hit
show we tore up their contracts and gave
them new contracts with quite a lot more
money by the fifth season Suzanne
Summers and Joyce DT were to get each
$30,000 an episode with 22 Episodes
taped each season that meant DT and
Summers were earning more than
$650,000 each year John Ritter was
pulling down close to a million
nevertheless in the middle of the Season
Suzanne and her manager husband Alan
Hamill decided to renegotiate I&#39;m
certainly a star of this show so
bringing a lot to it um I&#39;d like to be
paid um what men comparable in my
business were being paid she quoted a
number of other actors that were getting
top money Alan Alder Carol oconor people
like that Alan Alda of mash and Carol
oconor Of All in the Family were each
making an excess of $200,000 per episode
but they were clearly the stars of their
respective shows producers assistant B
Dallas if you&#39;re going to say well who&#39;s
the star if you want to name somebody it
was John Ritter show could not have gone
on without John Summers and Hamill
strongly disagreed on July 24th 1980
Hamill met with executive producer Ted
Bergman and representatives from ABC in
that meeting Allan said you know
Suzanne&#39;s brought a lot to the show and
we would like this much money or we
would like a piece of the back end I
said I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll do we&#39;ll
give you $5,000 more per
episode and Hamill acted like I had
him he said that&#39;s crazy that&#39;s
nothing I said well what is it that you
want and he said I shall never forget
this as long as I live we won
$150,000 an episode and 10% ownership of
program and I started to laugh Summers
felt the chips were stacked act against
her from the very beginning my lawyer
had uh some unfinished business with an
ABC lawyer who he had my lawyer had just
done lever and Shirley&#39;s renegotiation
that ABC lawyer said to my lawyer you
got me before you&#39;re not going to get me
again Suzanne&#39;s husband and manager Alan
Hamill they were intent on setting an
example ABC because uh they looked at
this as an opportunity to save money on
renegotiations in the future cuz they
had renegotiated with lever and Shirley
and now it was Suzanne and they really
wanted to stop it others put the blame
on Suzanne she was greedy and there was
no reason for it I mean Allan Hamill
says there were no negotiations there
was nothing they just said no you when
someone comes in and demands things uh
you know everybody got riled up I think
they were willing to negotiate but
nowhere near what Suzanne and Allen were
hoping for executive producer Ted
Bergman explains why we have a parody
Arrangement between Joyce and Suzanne
and if we give her give Suzanne
150,000 we&#39;re going to have to give
150,000 and we also have an arrangement
with John that he gets more than each of
the girls so let&#39;s say we have to give
200,000 that adds up to a half a mill
million dollar before we even write a
script Summers claims she was aware of
the parody agreement and that Ritter and
DT knew she was planning to renegotiate
I had said to them at the last one of
the last tapings the season before my
contract is up next week and that next
year when I come back and um I&#39;m going
to I&#39;m going to go for uh big money or a
piece of the back end and if I get it
you guys get it that might have happened
about renegotiation none of that matters
I&#39;ll go renegotiate you go renegotiate
but the the fact is is that and then
let&#39;s come back to the if you get yes or
no we come back and play Joyce dwit
denies summers&#39;s ever discussed
renegotiating I think it&#39;s an
extraordinary unkindness on her part to
um make that up I really do it&#39;s a
terrible thing to say about somebody
when it isn&#39;t true Suzanne could afford
to play hard ball with her producers
because of her deal with CBS former
manager Jay Bernstein if I knew I had a
deal at CBS to do
another uh I think it was three Pilots
for a
series I would feel a little stronger
about walking in and uh renegotiating
the contractual blow up was the first in
a series of events that eroded the
relationship between Suzanne Summers and
the Threes Company cast crew director
Dave Powers the timing of it is
what what really made Things Fall Apart
and that was trying to do a midseason
negotiation with ABC as The Fifth Season
progressed into the summer production
was delayed due to an actor&#39;s strike
when shooting resumed in October Suzanne
Summers was a noow I didn&#39;t come to work
the day after I&#39;d done The Tonight Show
because I broke my ribs on The Tonight
Show uh doing a dance the facts of this
incident remain clouded in controversy
Suzanne&#39;s appearance on The Tonight Show
was September 19th almost 3 weeks before
her return to the Threes Company set
hospital records indicate Summers was
admitted to Cedar Cai Medical Center on
September 20th but from September 23rd
through October 8th she performed her
nightclub act at the MGM Grand in Las
Vegas according to arbitration documents
Summers claimed she was in so much pain
during these shows that she needed a
back brace because of the contentious
contract negotiations The Producers were
suspicious of the injury prompting
associate producer Wendy Blair to
contact Three&#39;s Company costumer Len
Marcus Wendy&#39;s question to me and there
was a lawyer there at that time too was
did you ever see Suzanne in a
brace and my answer to her
was I was never in the room when Suzanne
changed so I don&#39;t know whether she had
a brace on or not and that that was not
the truth I mean I I had seen suzan and
she did not have a brace
on so I lied for Suzanne because Suzanne
was that special to me the producers
also contacted the costume designer who
worked with summers in Vegas the
Wardrobe lady said oh no she didn&#39;t have
a brace on unfortunately I think the
story got back to Suzanne differently
and she&#39;s not spoken to me since that
Sunday October 19th Marsha yanchuk
Suzanne&#39;s assistant called to say that
Suzanne had reinjured her rib and
wouldn&#39;t be in for the taping that day
we asked her to go see the doctor that
they went to for shots whatever they
needed Dr
Julie and uh she didn&#39;t want to go so
she held us up there and HED up and her
house and uh you know just said she
couldn&#39;t come to work the episode was
hastily Rewritten with most of Chrissy&#39;s
lines reassigned to Don knots it turned
out to be a sort of a windfall for me in
a way
because uh the writers had been writing
this great stuff for her that was all
the goofy
stuff and uh then when they didn&#39;t have
her they started giving me the goofy
stuff Summers was due back on the set
Tuesday October 21st to tape the next
episode but again she was a no-show this
time Suzanne&#39;s absence forced producers
to cancel the taping the question hung
in the air was Suzanne&#39;s injury real it
was obvious to to us at that point that
this was a negotiating Ploy that she and
Hamill were pulling my lawyer said uh
they think you&#39;re renegotiating uh let&#39;s
let them think that was there a
renegotiation employ going on yeah was
there broken ribs yeah the show&#39;s
producers decided to take drastic action
we told the ABC
brass that we wanted to cancel her for
breach of
contract and ABC said you can&#39;t do that
uh it might affect the ratings you got
to keep her on the show after a week&#39;s
Hiatus the cast crew and Suzanne
returned to the set Friday October 30th
relationships were strained Suzanne
discussed the tension on a 1981 Donahue
appearance you know I talked the last
show that I did um John and Joyce did
not talk the last full show that I did
they did not talk to me at all and I
before the show was so upset so I talked
to John Ritter and I said you know we
are professionals I understand that
you&#39;re angry with me but there are two
sides to every story and he just looked
at me and walked away I don&#39;t I wish I
had a better answer I don&#39;t understand
understand the anger John defended her
for a long time until the missed
episodes and things that started to hurt
the rest of us the rest of the
production then he turned and uh it
ended up where you know people were not
speaking the problem she was having with
the producers and the network spilled
over into the rehearsal hall because she
wasn&#39;t there and we were getting two
scripts a blue one with her and a pink
one without her writer producer Kim weof
now we were starting to have to uh
prepare to take her out of scripts to uh
to throw out a few scripts where she was
crucial uh which was actually most of
them Suzanne requested to be excused
from rehearsals on Saturday November 1st
to attend her son&#39;s soccer game she
promised to return the next day ready to
rehearse but that Saturday Allan Hamill
called executive producer Mickey Ross to
say Summers would not be returning
because of the hostile work environment
Hamill was ready to discuss money and
points Ross declined Mickey took the
stance that I was trying to ruin their
show and created an atmosphere of mob
fury on the set and um uh it became an
impossible situation for me to ever be
understood Suzanne summers&#39;s third
absence proved to be the final straw we
were worried that she was going to hold
the show hostage again in and not show
up for
tapings so it was decided to use her in
the a way that she could least harm the
show coming up Suzanne Summers gets
demoted the whole thing was to humiliate

go in the fall of 1980s Suzanne Summers
went to war with ABC and her Threes
Company producers Summers wanted more
money The Producers wouldn&#39;t renegotiate
production ground to halt friends became
enemies and the executives were faced
with the gut-wrenching decision of what
to do with their rebellious
actress on Monday November 3rd 1980
Summers arrived for rehearsal at the
studio after having missed several days
of work she was in fact written out of
the script production executive George
sa I was the one that had to go down and
say to U uh uh Suzanne and Allen I&#39;m
sorry uh but I have to ask you to leave
because John will not perform while
you&#39;re still in the building and since
she wasn&#39;t going to perform uh there was
no reason for her at this point to u to
even be there my feeling was what is the
best thing for the show and her feeling
was you know what&#39;s the best thing for
me on November 6th The Producers called
new ABC president Tony theopolis to
discuss suzan&#39;s future executive
producer Bernie West the network said
don&#39;t lose yet keep her on the show the
name is very important the decision was
made to keep Suzanne on the show but in
the smallest way possible Mickey uh was
the one I remember came up uh with with
the idea she has to go home uh be with
her sick mother and it&#39;ll be a one
minute phone call in the tag ABC agreed
to the plan but Three&#39;s Company by
definition couldn&#39;t exist with only two
roommates a frantic search went out for
a new woman to step into Chrissy&#39;s shoes
author Chris man they wanted a blond who
could absorb some of the scripts that
had already been written that included
the Chrissy character actress Jenny Lee
Harrison was one of many who auditioned
for the coveted part my agent calls up
and says oh they&#39;re looking for a girl
to replace Suzanne Summers and they want
to see you and I said nah I ain&#39;t going
what a waste of time me you know
replacing Susan suers 21-year-old Jenny
Lee an ex- cheerleader for the Los
Angeles Rams had almost no previous
acting experience but she was young
athletic and beautiful I think
initially the desire was to create
suzan if possible and Jenny Lee seemed
to fit that mold on November 7th Jenny
Lee Read for executive producers Mickey
Ross and Bernie West 5 days later they
took Harrison to ABC I found out this
months later but when I walked in for
the audition I tripped and that&#39;s why I
got the part Jenny Lee came on board as
Chrissy&#39;s clumsy but well-meaning cousin
Cindy snow Cindy snow was the clutzy
Bumpkin cousin of Chrissy snow who just
came in uh from the farm to experience
City Life Jenny Lee knew almost
immediately that she had stepped into a
tense situation there a lot a lot of
pressure for a young girl big shoes to
fill and I was trying to please a lot of
people I producers co-stars everything
else just staring me down and saying
okay you know you&#39;re the new show was
tough costume designer Len Marcus the
world was watching and holding its
breath to see what was going to happen
with this number one show you know was
was very important to everyone making
the transition more difficult was the
Spectre of Suzanne who still had to
report to work each week to tape her one
minute tag
scenes oh I&#39;m so sorry I can&#39;t be there
they&#39;d make me come pick up the script
the day before um meeting the director
in a in a a private office I wasn&#39;t
allowed to go to the set or to the
rehearsal Hall so the whole thing was to
humiliate to demean to humiliate put me
in my place director Dave Powers was
Suzanne&#39;s only contact on the show
during this time it was really ugly and
there were a lot of tears from from her
and from the rest of the cast it was not
a Happy Time script supervisor Carol
summers at that point the actors didn&#39;t
want to uh to work with her so uh I was
taken into uh an announce booth and when
Chrissy would be talking on the phone to
somebody that person was me I would
sometimes break down in tears and what I
knew was there was a a a monitor feed to
every dressing room and every office in
the in the studio there is that&#39;s just
the way Television Studios are I knew
they were all watching all of them it
was too compelling not to it just got so
strange and so out of hand and there it
was all new ground I mean we&#39;d never
seen this treatment usually an actor is
fired but she was sort of kept around
for the end of the season and ABC didn&#39;t
really want to fire her and it was just
really a horrible you know embarrassing
time for everyone Suzanne refused to
take the humiliation lying down suzan
was trying to get her job back she had
been reduced to this insignificant part
and she went out in the press to air her
grievances they have me come in on
Thursdays to pick up the script in a
private room all I do is walk in they
hand it to me and walk out on Tuesdays
they have me come in the back door they
have a guard placed in the hall they
have guards placed in front of my
dressing room which they&#39;ve now given to
John Ritter I&#39;m allowed to use it for 20
minutes they sneak me into a set that is
built behind the set I&#39;m not allowed to
go on the Threes Company set I have to
do my one minute and the guards stand
there until I&#39;m out of the studio then
they bring the other actors in don&#39;t ask
me why producers assistant B Dallas
challenges many of Suzanne&#39;s allegations
nobody had a permanent dressing room
there weren&#39;t that many of them and John
would always give you his up to the
girls to Jo and Suzanne so there no one
ever took anything away from her despite
the animosity Ritter felt the dispute
would ultimately be resolved I assumed
it would be over any day I mean it would
all take care of itself and then she&#39;d
come back but after the Press pounced on
the story the war of words escalated and
made the possibility of reconciliation
unlikely you can&#39;t go on Coast to Coast
TV and ask your fans to black ball the
show as a negotiation ploy to try and
force the hand of the other side to give
you what you want and think that the
other side&#39;s going to ask you to keep
playing when all the thing hit the Press
uh Joyce and I and the rest of us were
real quiet when um when they would ask
us about Suzanne everything and I really
you know love Suzanne I was like
heartbroken that this you know the
battle lines were being drawn the
Suzanne Summers controversy had a
noticeable effect on the show&#39;s
popularity the ratings fell out of the
top 10 which had only happened like
twice when Suzanne was on the show we
got the feeling that the audience missed
Suzanne and I
think uh something went out of the show
when Suzanne left there&#39;s no denying
that as the relationship between Suzanne
and the producers deteriorated the
battle lines moved Beyond just the set
of Three&#39;s Company as part of her Las
Vegas act Suzanne used outtakes from the
show and performed some of her songs in
character as Chrissy when she went to
Las Vegas to do her at the MGM
Grand a couple of us went up there
because we had heard she was going to
use the Chrissy character which everyone
felt very strongly that she did not have
a right to use the Chrissy character was
created by
nrw uh very
definitely and as such it was the
property of the
show and for her to take it and use it
elsewhere was you know like anybody
taking a literary property that didn&#39;t
belong to them the debate raged who
created the Chrissy character I&#39;m the
one who turned her feet in I&#39;m the one
who lifted her shoulders up I&#39;m the one
who gave her the stance nobody did that
writer producer Kim Weiss cop who
created Chrissy Snow Well the character
was written and the character developed
and uh and everyone participates in it
the writer The Producers the actor
so you can&#39;t really say I or you created
a character but the producers threatened
legal action if Suzanne continued to
portray Chrissy in her act and then all
of a sudden I get uh cease and desist
intent to sue you cannot do this
character on television you cannot do
this character on stage you cannot do
this character you cannot wear your hair
that way Suzanne did remove all
references to Chrissy from her act then
she responded with litigation of her own
in February of 1981 Summers filed an
arbitration suit against her producers
Suzanne was asking for about $2 million
a million dollar for being written out
of three different episodes and about a
million dollars for damages to her
career that she felt that this um
disputed caused Suzanne&#39;s husband and
manager Alan Hamill once we got into it
I realized this was an error you know
we&#39;re sitting here fighting over money
and it was a substantial amount of money
but it wasn&#39;t going to change anyone&#39;s
lifestyle after two months of testimony
the arbitrator awarded Suzanne $30,000
for One Missed episode for which she had
not been paid all other rulings favored
The Producers when he came down with
that ruling that it would cost $330,000
to dispose of this uh
arbitration we readily agreed it was
worth $30,000 to be through with it
which we were on April 2nd 1981 ABC
announced that Suzanne Summers would not
be returning for the sixth season of
Three&#39;s Company Suzanne read about her
firing in the newspaper she was now free
to pursue her series at CBS but the
dispute continued to follow her I tried
to do the series deal at CBS I kept
getting CE and deiss intent to sue
lawsuits from the Nichols Ross and West
production company um that if I were to
do a character that walked like talk
like dress like um in any way shape or
form warm reminded anyone of Chrissy
snow that they would sue me so that made
CBS very nervous and they watered down
what I was doing and so after two pilots
that never went off they paid her for
the remaining 11 episodes and not one
show ever aired despite her meteoric
rise Suzanne Summers effectively
disappeared from network television for
more than a decade former manager Jay
Bernstein that&#39;s what she found out when
she was off the show that once you&#39;re

Mercury in Martell chances are you&#39;ll be
back year after
year Suzanne summers&#39;s Public Power
struggle with the producers of thre&#39;s
company resulted in her demotion and
subsequent firing in 1981 the show
continued but the new roommates had
problems of Their Own
as the Suzanne Summers renegotiation
drama played itself out in late 1980
Jenny Lee Harrison stepped in as the new
roommate but her character Cindy snow
didn&#39;t evoke the sexual tension that the
show needed to survive writer producer
George berett we got to get someone who
is sexy let John get back to that
layering self of his my character
again was not the character to tell sex
jokes so there was no sexual innuendo
going on the producers were worried
about that because I thought you know we
need to keep keep this sex thing up
director Dave Powers when I looked back
on it we were all looking for another
Chrissy I think we expected too much of
Jenny Lee it was decided that Jenny Lee
would stay on in a limited role but for
the second time in 2 years the producers
embarked on an extensive search for a
new blonde roommate we searched around
for someone more experienced and and
comedic and uh we we came up with
Priscilla Barnes 25-year-old Beauty
Priscilla Barnes had auditioned for the
part of Chrissy&#39;s cousin 8 months
earlier but the producers deemed her too
old she was perfect however as the
sophisticated but slightly screwy nurse
Terry Alden no way why
not thank
you we used to giggle because we&#39;d go
you know I&#39;m the smart one and yet the
show wouldn&#39;t work if anybody if any of
the main characters had an IQ IQ over 25
Priscilla began to feel the pressure the
day she was hired on my answering
machine was 44 messages I&#39;ll never
forget that and they were from Good
Morning americ you know CBS and NBC
every morning show every evening show
every talk show and it was weird that I
felt all this acknowledgment was coming
to me and I hadn&#39;t done anything I mean
I had hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t put anything in the
can I hadn&#39;t walked on the S I hadn&#39;t
met my co-stars or anything so then the
anxiety started to build John Ritter and
Joyce dwit just wanted to put the
Suzanne Summers nightmare behind them by
that point we had weathered the storm we
weren&#39;t off the air we had survived and
we were doing well again and uh there
was a new kind of energy a new kind of
Life blood so when they brought
in you had someone with the experience
and the knowhow to
start doing it right away and um that
was wonderful plus Priscilla became one
of my dearest friends with the addition
of Priscilla the sexual tension returned
to the show and the ratings returned to
the top 10 on the surface things were
back to normal below the surface
Priscilla was miserable it was just very
nerve-wracking I mean after the third
show I think anybody knows this I went
to the head of the network Lou Erick and
I said I want to be taken off the show I
wanted to leave the show because I I
wasn&#39;t comfortable there because Barnes
was under contract the network denied
her request handling the sudden Fame was
another problem for Priscilla I found
out that I didn&#39;t
particularly you know care for it I mean
when you go into a bathroom and people
are underneath the stall you know
shoving toilet paper for you to sign and
ripping off your sunglasses and and it&#39;s
just because you feel like you&#39;re going
to dis disappoint them as the ratings
rebound bounded Jenny Lee Harrison&#39;s
role got progressively smaller poor
Jenny Lee Not only was she replaced but
she had to work with a person that was
her replacement it was soon apparent
that the sixth season would be Jenny
Lee&#39;s Last I think that was the
arrogance of our producers sorry guys
but it was to think that you know they
could like mold this person into what
they wanted um and instead of like
hiring a really good actress to do the
job jny Lee accepted the news as
gracefully as possible I would have
loved to stayed on th&#39;s company for the
duration of th&#39;s
company uh when I knew that I was going
to be leaving the show uh I didn&#39;t take
the time to to stop and ponder that I
just kept working Priscilla settled into
the weekly grind but she found herself
repeatedly locking horns with executive
producer Mickey Ross he would give me a
line reading on
like how how we going to pay the rent oh
Jack how we going to pay the rent I mean
like this one line like who gives line
readings on that Priscilla came into
this well oiled
machine and I don&#39;t think that we took
the time and when I say we I mean the
writers producers myself to realize that
she needed guidance as opposed to
criticism Priscilla knew that mickeey
Ross had a history of trying to shape
his actresses I we hear all these
stories how you know he had created
Suzanne and taken her from wherever he
had gotten her and made her and then
Jenny Lee Mickey Ross maintains that
Priscilla dictated the direction of the
Terry Alden character not him what we
had to do was right to her personality
you know we couldn&#39;t just blank say this
is you got to play at this we can&#39;t so
we work with her we saw what she could
do best and that&#39;s what we did with her
two things made Priscilla&#39;s situation
completely different from the Suzanne
Summers controversy first the dispute
was a private internal struggle not the
public Fiasco that Suzanne&#39;s departure
had been secondly Barnes had an ally
Joyce DT because I found it difficult to
work with our
producers just in terms of the
dictatorial style and their chauvinism
which was well I honest to goly I think
at that time if you looked in the
dictionary under chauvinism there&#39; just
be like a little picture of their heads
Priscilla may have felt trapped by her
role but she was under contract for 3
years they had offered me more money if
I do another two years and I had said no
and they had said in their usual
parental disciplinarian like they were
the parents and you&#39;re the child uh well
if you don&#39;t do that that then they&#39;re
going to give me considerably less money
as a penalty and that&#39;s what they did
despite the visibility thre&#39;s company
gave her career Priscilla Barnes has
mostly negative memories of this chapter
in her life to me it&#39;s it&#39;s a very sad
experience you know and there&#39;s only a
couple of shows that are my favorite
that that make me laugh but I honestly
this is I mean I hesitate to say this
but you know those were the three one of
the probably the three worst years of my
life ironically those same three years
provided the show with some of its
greatest critical Acclaim at the end of
the sixth season there was a 2hour
retrospective of the show&#39;s greatest
moments the host was none other than
legendary comedian Lucille Ball who was
one of the show&#39;s biggest fans you know
what I like about this show it doesn&#39;t
try to change the world or solve any
major problems all it does is make us
laugh and forget our own cares that&#39;s my
kind of Comedy it was a dream through I
just remember being sort of days that
she endorsed our show the next season
thre&#39;s company taped its 150th episode
and in 1984 John Ritter won both a
Golden Globe award and an Emmy Award for
his portrayal of Jack Trier and the
is John
Ritter thank you very much I&#39;m all a
quiver uh as Bruce uh as Bruce said my
mother thank you and also she&#39;d like to
buy everybody up their lunch tomorrow
morning but as time passed and thre&#39;s
Company moved into its seventh and
eighth Seasons it became clear the
creative spark was beginning to diminish
it&#39;s very hard to keep doing this
because it&#39;s feels like you&#39;ve done
everything that it&#39;s you say oh God
we&#39;re going to do that again you know
and it&#39;s it&#39;s frustrating you just run
out of of things we have for show runs
long enough it uh it becomes harder and
harder to uh uh keep up the uh the the
newness the the novelty and uh anything
else that the show has it became more
and more difficult to come up with
original storylines on that eighth
season and I I&#39;ve said this before when
uh Terry Janet and Jack are trying to
hide a kitty from Mr Furley and I
remembered in the first season when uh
Chrissy Janet and Jack were trying to
hide a puppy from Mr rer I went I think
you can only take a series so far just
like what just happened to uh Seinfeld
you know finally can&#39;t uh what what else
you going to do with them to make
matters worse ABC&#39;s powerful Tuesday
night lineup began to fade and the face
of television as a whole was changing TV
was starting to get a little violent
back then not car Caron violent you know
um and the sitcom was in Decline overall
NBC in particular took a big chunk out
of the ratings for thre&#39;s company with
two high-powered action series The A
Team and Riptide once again thre&#39;s
company dropped out of the top 10 writer
producer George bdit the rating
certainly gradually declined and uh it
had nothing to do with who is playing
what role on the show but the producers
and the network weren&#39;t ready to throw
in the towel just yet it got to the
point where we felt that we had run out
of Comedy
situations and we wanted to try
something different eight seasons that&#39;s
it so we can either all say goodbye or
you know do this other
thing when The E True Hollywood Story
continues a new beginning and a bitter
ending it was
difficult enough hurtful enough
disappointing enough in terms of
disrespectful treatment that um I did
have to
disappear experience the greatest True
Hollywood stories ever told it was like
a fairy story gone wrong every night at
8 all September long only on E fretta
brought us together to make great pizza

by 1984 after eight seasons of trials
and tribulations thre&#39;s company began to
lose the Creative Energy that propelled
the show to number one but instead of
ending the series The Producers decided
on another
option the original British version of
Three&#39;s Company man about the house
spawned not one but two spin-offs
Three&#39;s Company had spun off The Ropers
without much success nevertheless a
second spin-off was in the works they
were always talking to me about a
spin-off um in fact you know around the
fifth fourth or fifth season Suzanne was
still on the show I said do a spin-off
The Ropers would do the spin-off of The
Ropers then in a few years a spin-off of
of You by 1983 ABC and the show&#39;s
producers were ready to seriously
consider this possibility executive
producer Ted Bergman probably in the
seventh season we started to drop out of
the top
10 and at that point the network
expressed the idea that the show was
tired and that&#39;s when we proposed to do
a spin-off in the second spin-off called
thre&#39;s a crowd Jack Tripper finally
settles down with a girlfriend only to
buttthe heads with her opinionated
father but even before th a crowd was
officially announced Joyce dwit noticed
some disturbing Chang es the publicity
shots that were used in TV Guide or the
local TV papers TV sections or it would
either be John and both of us or be John
and one of us or um 90% of the time
that&#39;s what would happen all of a sudden
there were all these press releases done
with John and a guest star a female not
one of the girls Joyce asked if the
producers were planning any major
changes I approached my producers
directly and
queried them on that directly and was
lied to to my
face um and of course being the
completely trusting soul that I was at
the time I bought their explanation and
you know after the fact realized that I
was so naive The Producers knew that
spinning off only one character might be
a political mindfield so they developed
the new show in secret until they were
ready to break the news co-star
Priscilla Barnes remembers the meeting
we all sat on the floor and they said
that they were you know this was this
was the last season they were uh
spinning off a show it was like a family
meeting that was really hard but
everybody came through it and then
people sort of saw the writing on the
wall co-stars Joyce dwit and Richard
Klein were upset at how the matter was
handled I think the way in which that
the secretive furtive
deceptive abusive unkind and cruel way
in which they chose to treat their
company of actors not nice and it broke
my heart I think there was a sense of
resentment when the the uh spin-off was
announced because of the way the uh
ladies were treated I don&#39;t think they
were informed too much ahead of time and
you know Bad Business Joyce placed some
of the blame on John Ritter I&#39;m assuming
that whatever his participation was he
did it for reasons that he knows and he
feels appropriate about author Chris man
I think she felt that he should have
told her something and that her
her but then again the
producers ran the show and they said
this is our call and this is what we&#39;re
going to do Priscilla Barnes on the
other hand wasn&#39;t surprised yeah I
thought it was kind of tacky how they
were handling it but see I I thought
that they had hand handled me shabby the
entire 3 years so it wasn&#39;t like I was a
queen and then being treated like crap I
mean it was pretty much par for the
course as far as I was concerned The
Producers now had the Dual task of
winding up thre&#39;s company while looking
ahead to th a crowd more than 500 women
auditioned for the part of Jack&#39;s
girlfriend Vicky Bradford Broadway
dancer and television novice Mary
cateret won the part I had not met John
but as soon as I walked in the door and
went to shake his hand I mean there was
an instant chemistry between the two of
that I mean I I really remember that
sort of Click we both had producers
assistant be Dallas he liked her
immediately John just liked Mary
immediately and felt she would be
perfect for him but did the search for
Jack&#39;s girlfriend really need to extend
outside the show production executive
George sa the
expectation in some areas was that Jack
definitely should fall in love with with
the Janet character John Ritter
disagrees in order for the show to work
you had to have a father who despised
Jack and and we had met Joyce&#39;s Janet&#39;s
father and Chrissy&#39;s father and mother
and every you know in other words that
had to be a new character one other
bizarre scenario presented itself Alan
Hamill allegedly contacted the producers
about Suzanne Summers becoming Jack&#39;s
girlfriend in the spin-off it was a
ridiculous suggestion at that point
after she sued us after cost us all that
money to defend ourselves after we had
to pay additional money to settle the
thing uh it was obvious that she was out
of our lives and we didn&#39;t want her back
joining the cast as Vicky&#39;s abrasive
father was veteran star of soap and
Private Benjamin Robert Mandan it was
really that simple we did the last two
shows of Three&#39;s uh Three&#39;s Company that
was the the bridge between the two shows
but for the co-stars of Three&#39;s Company
the transition wasn&#39;t that simple they
actually told us that they were going to
take two weeks off to really polish the
last four shows so we go away on this
unexpected Hiatus and we come back and
in our rehearsal Hall are the cast of
John spinoff they&#39;ve been working these
whole two weeks these they they have
moved into our house we don&#39;t even live
here anymore as the eighth season wound
to a close it was decided that the final
two-part episode of Three&#39;s Company
would serve as the pilot for th a crowd
needless to say it was a tense situation
both shows that we did were were painful
and Mary and I really kind of stayed out
of the way because we weren&#39;t really
aware of all the feelings that went on I
specifically remember Joyce sort of
taking me aside and saying you know you
might feel a little bit of tension
because we sort of feel that this is the
ending and we&#39;re sort of servicing a new
project and it&#39;s kind of hard for us
because we wish it was being done in a
little different way but so if you feel
any tension please know that it&#39;s not
directed to you on September 18th 1984
in a bitter Sweet Hour of Television
Jack moved in with his new girlfriend
Vicky Terry Alden left for Hawaii and
Janet after a whirlwind courtship
married her
boyfriend Three&#39;s Company was no more
Joyce dwit took the ending particularly
hard it
was difficult enough hurtful enough
disappointing enough in terms of
disrespectful treatment that um I did
have to disappear and kind of go this is
the way uh the game is played I don&#39;t
want to play anymore for the cast The
Long and windy road had come to a Bitter
End for John rder and the crew work
continued threes a crowd began
production and immediately experienced
some controversy of its own Jack and
Vicky lived together but they weren&#39;t
married people had a cow um and it was
the funniest thing because people at
that time all over America were living
together this was uh just the early 80s
and and that morality was still the old
old morality if you will was still
hanging around threes a crowd premiered
September 25th 1984 in thre&#39;s company&#39;s
old time slot after one season the show
finished 38th in the ratings I just
think that there might have been such
resistance that the fact that this is
not one of our girls that we grew up
with in the last eight seasons that that
uh by resentment you know people may not
have looked at uh the show Joyce dwit
for one wasn&#39;t surprised I think it was
the most succinct example of Instant
Karma I&#39;ve ever seen their show failed
instantly and I know that had to have
been extremely painful for all of them
particularly for
John um but they built their house on
Sand AB BC had a tough decision to make
would threes a crowd return for a second
season we were sort of on the fence and
and and actually it was picked up and
then not picked up and then really
picked up and then I think it was picked
up for like 13 shows but Network
Executives reversed themselves again in
the spring of 1985 the decision was made
to cancel threes a crowd in favor of one
more season of the Gary Coleman sitcom
Different Strokes initially when I found
out that we were canceled I was very St
about it but I think it took a couple
years for me to get over it after nine
turbulent exhausting painful and
exhilarating Seasons Jack Tripper
tumbled across our television screens
for the final time and Three&#39;s Company
faded into television
history coming up the stars of Three&#39;s
Company reflect on 20 years gone by in
hindsight I would um do I would do
handle that renegotiation iation
differently it was more than just a zip
code it was a lifestyle hi my name is

after a highly successful 9-year run two
spin-offs and several painful and public
cast changes Three&#39;s Company bid
farewell to the airwaves in 1985 few
shows leave behind as Rich a legacy of
both entertainment and
turmoil throughout its run freze company
never pretended to be anything more than
it was for the most part I think it will
be looked at as very funny show a farce
that didn&#39;t change set out to change the
world but that made people laugh and
that was
innocent and provocative but harmless we
did a one act show every Friday
night uh one act
play that to me was they were Little
Gems some even refer to the sitcom as
the original show about nothing I think
th company was it perhaps if I can be so
bold or arrogant to say that it was an
early version of what Seinfeld
eventually became Suzanne Summers and
Alan Hamill have had many years to
reflect on her ugly and public departure
from the show I just wish I hadn&#39;t had
to leave under such adverse conditions I
wish I didn&#39;t have to leave with all
these people hating me I&#39;m almost 20
years older now and 20 years
wiser and I I I definitely would have
handled it
differently um I don&#39;t know if I could
have changed their
minds but my deportment probably would
have been different it was a really
tough time and I&#39;m glad to see that we
all survived in spite of it Suzanne
Summers left a hole that the show never
completely filled when we lost Chrissy
the show was never quite the same but
time has managed to heal some of the
wounds I saw her a number of years ago
and had a really great encounter with
her and uh but then I always did have a
great time with her you know I mean I
she&#39;s very special to me just like Joyce
you know is still the relationship
between Suzanne and Joyce remains
strained but I think I think it ran
pretty deep with joy that&#39;s my feeling
if she
really now believes that that&#39;s how it
happened then she isn&#39;t going to be able
to learn from the situation because her
perspective is so skewed until they sit
down and talk to each other oneon-one I
don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll ever really be
healed for Joyce dwit the show&#39;s bitter
ending sent her out of Hollywood on a
spiritual journey that lasted 9 years I
ended up studying the great religions of
the world ended up traveling all over
working with unbelievable
teachers I have had the Good Fortune of
studying with unbelievable people who
have shared with me the wisdom that
years and years of study and life has
taught them the cast members have all
moved on to other jobs and other roles
but to a certain extent they will always
be known as The Lovable characters they
portrayed so many years ago would never
tray the experience for for th company
even Suzanne Summers has managed to find
a silver lining I learned I I grew I
moved on I moved forward and I&#39;m not
consumed with uh bitterness or or
anything other than uh that was an
interesting life experience one that
most people will never have sadly time
has taken a toll on the show&#39;s original
cast in 1997 audre Lindley lost a battle
with leukemia a year later lindley&#39;s TV
husband Norman Fel died of bone cancer
in 2001 Suzanne Summers revealed she was
battling cancer and had a lump removed
from her breast the actress also
disclosed she was treating herself with
iscador an herbal medicine in instead of
chemotherapy you know they took the
cancer out of me and um the the worry
about breast cancer is recurrent so my
what I&#39;ve chosen to do for U my
Aftercare is controversial but I feel
really good about it and I just feel
like uh you know I&#39;ve licked this
despite the problems that at times
overshadowed 3&#39;s company for 30 minutes
each week the comedy warmed our hearts
and made us laugh that was golden time
days of
Television uh it was a rare wonderful
experience and I can do it again I was
always happy and very very grateful to
come back to th company every year
whatever challenge we may have occurred
or incurred in the process of getting
the show ready or doing business um and
mushing that all together the actual
shooting of the show the actual audience
is in lights up curtain up let&#39;s do this
baby let&#39;s give it to him now now that
process was never anything but Exquisite
we used to get very strange busloads of
people to come to our show hey you want
to watch a taping what is it thre
company never heard of it so one time we
came out and in the front row this was
early on there were like 17
nuns and it&#39;s like Chrissy Chrissy
where&#39;s my left testicle I Don&#39;t Know
Jack you had it you know and we&#39;re doing
jokes like this and the nuns are like
Three&#39;s Company we thought it would be
the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
instead of these teenagers with
erections and
moisture anyway it was a nightmare and
then they said come on where you going
to get these people and they brought in
literally holy people from India with
dots and saffron robes going like this
are we getting money for this you know
they don&#39;t even understand who&#39;s finding
they said they&#39;re the only people that
can come you&#39;re going to not Berry Farm
though they shun us you know
