Kilmar Abrego Garcia is in ICE custody
at this hour after he showed up for an
appointment at a Baltimore field office.
US immigration officials have threatened
to deport the Maryland resident to
Uganda after he declined a plea deal.
Christian Benvdas reports.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A large crowd chanted in support of
Kilar Abrego Garcia as he entered an ICE
facility in Baltimore. The longtime
Maryland resident prayed with his family
and hugged his wife.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mr. Garcia was taken into custody by ICE
this morning.
ICE has threatened to deport Abrego
Garcia, who is a Salvadoran national, to
Uganda after he declined a deal to be
sent to Costa Rica in exchange for
pleading guilty to federal smuggling
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The only reason that they&#39;ve chosen to
take him into detention is to punish
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Before he walked inside, Abrago Garcia
addressed supporters. His message
translated by a representative of CASA,
the immigration advocacy group
championing his case.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I want you to remember this. Remember
that I am free and I was able to be
reunited with my family.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Alrego Garcia spent the weekend with his
family after his release from a
Tennessee jail where he&#39;d been held
since June. That&#39;s when the Trump
administration brought him back from El
Salvador on criminal charges after
mistakenly deporting him to his home
country in March. His case has become a
symbol of the administration&#39;s
immigration crackdown.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s just propaganda after propaganda
and it&#39;s somebody&#39;s life at stake.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Trump administration says Abrego
Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, human
trafficker, and that he beat his wife.
Allegations he denies.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The guy needs to be in prison. He
doesn&#39;t need to be on the streets like
all these liberals want him to be.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Abrego Garcia&#39;s attorneys have already
filed a lawsuit to try to prevent his
deportation for a second time that
triggered a court order automatically
pausing any actions for 2 days.
Christian Benavid, CBS News.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Berggo Garcia has been living in
Maryland for years after entering the US
illegally. He was stopped for speeding
in 2022 and the government claims he was
smuggling people because he had eight
passengers in his
