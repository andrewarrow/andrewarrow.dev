<li>Catherine Reynolds Lewis is the founder of the Institute for Independent Journalists, celebrating 14 years as a full-time independent journalist focused on long-form work</li>
<li>The institute was created by and for freelancers of color to share community wisdom, innovate best practices, and advocate for independent journalists as crucial to democracy</li>
<li>Long-form journalism is extremely difficult financially - writers often go into debt and struggle for years to get stories accepted by publications</li>
<li>Having an accountability buddy who checks in weekly is crucial for both emotional support and practical help with referrals and feedback</li>
<li>Most long-form stories take 1-3 years to complete, and successful freelancers typically work on only one major long-form piece per year</li>
<li>Writers must fund their own expenses upfront (travel, research, childcare) and may wait months or years for reimbursement</li>
<li>Pre-reporting is essential before pitching - you need to secure access to central characters and demonstrate the story's narrative potential</li>
<li>Fellowships and grants are crucial for sustaining long-form work - journalists should actively research and apply to multiple funding sources</li>
<li>Contract negotiation is critical - watch for rights grabs, indemnification clauses, and "work for hire" language that could cost you book/movie rights</li>
<li>Publications often exploit writers' eagerness to be published by offering poor contracts, betting writers won't negotiate for better terms</li>
<li>Successful long-form writers diversify income with teaching, speaking engagements, editing, and other non-journalism work to subsidize their passion projects</li>
<li>Mental health support and therapy are often necessary due to the traumatic nature of stories and the financial/emotional stress of the work</li>
<li>Writers must be extremely familiar with target publications before pitching - editors reject pitches that don't fit their audience or format</li>
<li>Strong pitches are 800-900 words and answer three key questions: why this story for this audience, why now, and why you're the right person to tell it</li>
<li>The most rewarding aspect is the deep human connections formed while reporting and the privilege of bearing witness to extraordinary ordinary people's experiences</li>
<li>Success requires redefining value beyond just bylines - the practice of long-form journalism itself is valuable, even during periods of rejection</li>
<li>Building a support network through organizations, conferences, and fellow journalists is essential for both practical advice and emotional sustainability</li>
<li>Long-form journalism serves democracy by telling diverse stories from voices typically ignored by mainstream media, making it worth the personal sacrifices required</li>

I am Catherine Reynolds Lewis I&#39;m the
founder of the institute for independent
journalists and myself I just celebrated
my 14-year anniversary as a full-time
independent journalist and I would say
the last 10 years I&#39;ve been really
focused on creating long form which is
why I&#39;m so excited to hear from the
experts and people whose work I admire
so much I&#39;m going to launch a poll
and cough because we&#39;re all struggling a
little bit so please take the poll and
we&#39;ll share the results in a little bit
so the institute for independent
journalists is was created by a group of
us who really wanted a space that was by
and for Freelancers of color where we
could really share Community wisdom
where we could innovate and find best
practices that help everyone to be
sustainable both financially and
emotionally and ultimately advocate for
the importance of independent
journalists as a core part of the media
ecosystem and really the stories that
are told by a diverse set of freelance
journalists are crucial to our democracy
to a functioning media ecosystem and
that&#39;s why we&#39;re so passionate about it
so I&#39;m going to start by briefly
introducing
um our panelists and then we&#39;re going to
go into to questions so I&#39;m really
excited to have with us here in no
particular order Erica hayasaki a writer
based in Southern California and
professor at the University of
California Irvine and author of
somewhere sisters really remarkable work
of nonfiction that reads like a novel
about three sisters
um two of whom are identical twins
separated through adoption and
transatlan you know across continents
and across the ocean and um and the
other two who were created as sisters by
adoption it&#39;s a really powerful
um I get got chills reading it so I
highly recommend order some of our
sisters Erica has made a really
compelling true story that is really
complicated and addresses a lot of the
issues all of us care about right race
family identity belonging you know what
it means to be a family
so um Erica will be the first to take a
question but I&#39;m just going to make sure
I touch on everyone
um I got a little too excited about the
book sorry about that Jaylee is a
contributing writer at the New York
Times magazine
um Lottie Joyner is an award-winning
journalist with more than two decades of
experience
um cover as a reporter and the new
assistant managing editor of veritain
news uh non New Orleans non-profit
Newsroom that is brand new so really
excited to have Lottie here and Valeria
Fernandez is a phoenix-based
investigative journalist and managing
editor of palabra which was created by
nah to support Freelancers and publishes
some really powerful exciting long-form
work so we&#39;ll start with Erica
um if you could just share how long have
you been creating long-form journalism
and what have has really made it work
for you
so I I used to be on staff at the LA
time and that&#39;s where I started to learn
more about long-form journalism and I
was occasionally allowed to do longer
pieces and then I left
um uh I guess it was about 12 years ago
or something like that and I started
teaching and I thought I would you know
freelance for magazines and do long form
and I thought I could just sort of
transition smoothly and it was actually
quite hard
um way harder than I ever realized I was
really ignored for years trying to get
stories into publication
um I knew I wanted to focus on long form
but it was it really took a lot of um
there were not a lot of resources like
this available for me at that time and I
just didn&#39;t have the right connections
or you know a lot of my pitches just
went completely ignored for years so
um and I could talk about how that
shifted and how that changed but
um but you know I balance teaching and
doing long-form pieces and other
um and it&#39;s kind of a Juggle but
um but it has been incredibly rewarding
over the last 10 years to do that and to
connect particularly with other writers
like yourselves who have been sort of
this support network over the years so
thanks for having me
thank you Erica
um so Jaya can you share sort of your
journey as a long-form journalist
um so I have been
um focusing on long form as if I went
freelance about six years ago a little
more than six years
um and I was uh just before I was a
staff reporter at Mother Jones magazine
um police shootings in their aftermath
um and I had for a very long time wanted
um try out long form
um and always fantasized about freelance
life and what that might be like
um and so in 2016 I sort of finally took
the leap and had less saved up than I
should have probably
um and so the first year was really me
flailing and trying to get my first
long-form piece out
um and was going into a lot of debt
um it was definitely a struggle
financially
um and after about a year in my second
year I started picking up side hustles
just through other Freelancers I knew
who would toss work my way
um a lot of it was non-journalism and I
had I was lucky to have
um some friends in particular
um a friend of mine who
um it actually because of advice that
khaki here on the call gave me
um on a on a panel at the Asian American
journals Association conference
to have an accountability buddy that you
check in with every week and
I would say probably it&#39;s possible more
than anything that&#39;s been the secret to
my ability to remain a freelancer after
all these years both in terms of like
um referrals to assignments a lot of it
was non-journalism related which meant
the work was a lot less fulfilling but
paid a lot more
um and also just like during those
emotional down periods
um helping to stay motivated read
pitches give feedback it&#39;s all the kind
of like
uh in between
you know tools or you know it really
gave me the ability to kind of push
through the the toughest chapters of
freelancing
um and of course you know I I have been
lucky and some of it I would say was
strategic and a lot of it was just like
being in the right place at the right
um picking up a pretty significant
fellowships that helped me a lot uh when
I needed it
so that that&#39;s kind of the the long and
short of it and happy to go into more
thank you Jaya I hear accountability
buddy may be in the audience
click on this
so thank you Katya for uh supporting the
great work and supporting each other and
I that resonates so much with me
um I only wrote my book because my
accountability buddy kept on me so
um and I think groups like this you know
also like 101 is super helpful like to
get really into the like I did not do
the two hours of work on this pitch
because I had a Girl Scout meeting or I
had a daily assignment and and trying to
really troubleshoot why I didn&#39;t do that
but also bigger groups I&#39;ve been in
three different you know groups of eight
to twelve people that really really
support me just hearing about what other
people are facing so thank you um and of
course yes being being fortunate to have
your I wouldn&#39;t say being in the right
place but having your excellent work
recognized by the American Mosaic prize
probably helped with the debt
yeah that was single-handedly the the
thing that got me out of debt um for
those of you who don&#39;t know it&#39;s a prize
that launched in 2018 that um Valeria
and I both won the same year it was the
very first year it&#39;s a hundred thousand
dollar prize which is like unheard of in
journalism I mean let alone
um as far as prizes go uh it was huge it
was life change changing and it it we
all every freelancer needs it
um to be honest but it definitely is a
has made a difference in my life for
great and um before I go to Valeria and
Lottie I&#39;m just going to share if I can
figure out the poll
um share the poll I&#39;m going to end the
and then share it
okay so it looks like
a good third of people are already
creating long-form and a lot of people
would like to do more than they are now
so that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting I think
that&#39;s how a lot of us feel that like
even when we&#39;re actually doing it it&#39;s
this small piece of our of our daily and
weekly routine so Valeria tell us a
little bit about your sort of experience
in the past as creating long-form work
and then maybe it also touch on palabra
yeah so I hope that there&#39;s some people
in the audience maybe that had a similar
experience in the sense that I come from
writing in Spanish and that&#39;s been my
passion since childhood so I started
working in a small community newspaper
in 2003 back when you really printed the
newspaper and I really wrote long and
that was like my first incursion on long
form was writing really really long
stories uh for the paper where that I
spent a long time you know throughout
the year and I was constantly trying to
build time to report on those big pieces
so when I transitioned uh to be a
freelancer just out of the blue right
because I wanted to work on a long long
film that&#39;s another uh form of long long
uh storytelling for six years
um I went into English right and I was
very very scared of like okay I am solid
I can write long I can write kind of
narrative like I I got this in me and I
flows through my veins but can I do this
in English so in 2013 I think it was I
approached a local paper here with a
magazine called The Phoenix Phoenix New
and the editor there Amy Silverman I
love her to pieces she&#39;s a great editor
gave me the chance of my life to really
ride my first long-form piece in in
English and I fell in love with it uh I
I really did so a couple of things I was
already a freelancer for like three four
years pretty established and solid with
a lot of clients when I started doing
the long form on my own in English so
that really helped me a lot because I
had a number of different sources of
revenue and in a similar way to Jaya I
leveraged assignments that were as a
producer you know I have a lot of skills
so I used
everything I had to like be able to
sustain my passion for long form frankly
um and so I did production work I did
reporting for television I did radio I
did commentary I built for everything I
could and carved that space so I could
do my my long form so it was it was a
um because uh it wasn&#39;t really that
profitable at the beginning
and it really does take a long long time
and as I said before to the panelists um
it&#39;s like a way of living working on
long-form stories is like okay this year
or for the next two years I choose to
leave with this story and it means a lot
of things
um I worked for yeah about two years on
a story about a young man who committed
suicide after he was deported uh to
Mexico for California Sunday magazine
and that was a really hard story to live
with for two years and part of it part
of that time I was pregnant so it was a
really interesting so I think that that
oh palabra sorry I know I was missing
something and now I am in the position
of you know it&#39;s kind of payback because
uh reporters teach me stories that are
really really long and we Embrace a lot
of that work if it fits you know if it&#39;s
the right story in palabra so hopefully
I&#39;ll put my email in here I&#39;ll be
hearing from some of you who want to you
know I&#39;m an editor so we&#39;re looking for
stories and so uh I invite you to check
out palabra and see some of the long
form we&#39;ve done and to pitch some of it
for us
great thank you Valeria and last but
definitely not least Lottie can you
share a little bit about your experience
with long form and how you you have made
it work or you&#39;ve seen colleagues make
it work
sure so uh I actually started out in
magazine journalism I didn&#39;t start out
at a newspaper so I started out my
journalism career writing long pieces
writing features and Enterprise stories
so that was my beginning
and then as journalism changed
you know people wanted quick quick hits
but I also found that there was a need
uh my
um my beat or my focus has always been
on the Civil Rights Movement
on social justice issues inequality like
Health disparities disparities mass
incarceration the criminal justice
and I found that there was a need for
for uh Publications who did not have
someone on staff to write about a civil
rights movement uh uh anniversary like
maybe when Fannie Lou Hamer stood before
the 1964 Democratic National con
convention and said this huge speech or
when the Emmett Till case was reopened
or the anniversary of the deaths of
James Chaney
and sharana Goodman and Cheney and
Mississippi that I had that knowledge in
um and because I had written about the
Civil Rights Movement for more than 20
years I found a way to leverage that
knowledge of writing about that and I
would pitch those stories to places who
did as I mentioned who didn&#39;t have
someone on staff to say hey right about
that uh I&#39;m I am now at oh I was editor
of the crisis magazine
for four years the crisis is the
official publication of the NAACP so we
focus on social and political issues
black history
African-American art and culture and I
edited long-form pieces uh around those
issues now I am at verite which is a New
Orleans based non-profit news Outlet
it&#39;s brand new so we&#39;re building The
Newsroom as I speak but the focus is on
long-form narratives
um long-form narratives around issues uh
that impact those in diverse communities
we really want to uplift those in
communities that the mainstream press
usually ignore so we go to
neighborhoods and
um diverse communities and we talk to
people about what&#39;s that top what&#39;s top
of mind for you what issues concern you
the most right Health the fact that
there&#39;s no Quality Health Care in your
neighborhood crime
um uh inequality in terms of the wealth
Gap in terms of the minimum wage what
about inflation you know you say you
have to drive two hours to uh to a great
job right and so now gas prices are
really and so we capture those
narratives uh of those whose voices
aren&#39;t usually heard that&#39;s what I
really like about this piece and that&#39;s
what I&#39;ve done for the past 20 years
thank you Lottie and I hope when you
start taking freelance you will let us
know and we&#39;ll put it we&#39;ll put a call
for pitches out on the iij uh newsletter
or if we serve
um so I would love to get maybe a little
bit into the nitty-gritty there&#39;s
actually already a question that I think
is really interesting is sort of how do
you organize the sort of pre-reporting
pitching reporting writing is there
anything that you&#39;ve learned over the
years that changes that you sort of wish
you knew earlier that changes how you
approach the sort of organizational
process of
you know getting into knowing maybe even
start with knowing it&#39;s a long form
story and then going into it and and
executing it
but when I did a project uh a project it
was a year-long project for USA Today
and it was about recidivism and I
started off with a statistic
and my whole project was around
answering that statistic so the
statistic was 50 of people who are
released from prison returned within
five years and I&#39;m like what oh my God
you know and so my whole project was
centered around talking to those
um who were who were back in prison
talking to those who had gone to prison
several times but I just I started off
with that little nugget and I built from
there and that was my process and that&#39;s
a lot of my process of asking why is
this right I started off asking I see a
huge uh disparity and I&#39;m and I start
off with the big question why is this
and then I start researching around that
question I go to of course the
Department of Justice statistics and
I&#39;ll go to other statistics and I&#39;m
trying to gather information around uh
organizations that work uh on criminal
justice issues and mass incarceration
and so I start off with the with the big
picture and then I get to the
nitty-gritty of those who are working on
the problem and then I think about who
should I talk to in terms of personal
stories that can get across this problem
so we actually went into jails right we
went into we went to uh we traveled to
Oklahoma we traveled to Louisiana uh and
talked to people in jails about when
they you know why were they back there
uh when they left what systems were
created by the criminal justice system
that basically put them back in prison
and so that&#39;s my process of starting off
with the why and then going from there
great thank you so much Lottie and um
actually we had a question of the chat
that I&#39;m just going to give my own
opinion for and then maybe the other
folks can include their their take on it
is what does it even mean to say long
form so to me I think of long firm not
so much as the length of the story but
that it&#39;s going deeply into a narrative
following an individual or institution
over some time so I think it&#39;s more the
medium than the actual length I&#39;ve
written the stories that are 4 000 4 500
Words that I consider long form so I
would say you know it&#39;s not about the
number of words it&#39;s more the experience
of reading or watching but
um one of the other three if you want to
jump in and talk about your process and
then maybe also answer that question I
can talk about something that I learned
that maybe you maybe you won&#39;t do
um when I when I was trying desperately
to get somebody to trust me to do a long
form piece when I transitioned into you
know away from newspapers
um and I said like nobody would take my
I did have one editor from this thing
called Kindle singles which was in
existence a long time ago which would
sometimes allow writers to do law
perform and um I wrote this Kindle
single at the time it was about
it was an it was like an investigative
narrative on uh looking at it had people
in it who had young men who had like
essentially drowned in a corn bin uh
grain bin in the midwest
um and it you know examined um are
dependent on grain and corn in this
country and through these narratives of
these survivors and people who passed
away but
um so that&#39;s a story that I wanted to do
but how did I do that how did I get
there nobody&#39;s paying for me to do this
you know if you&#39;re at the LA Times maybe
they&#39;ll put you on a plane to do
something but this was a long-form
project involved by Court going to court
records getting co-workers paying for
those traveling to the Midwest I lived
in California I had a baby at the time
um I brought my baby to do the rule I
brought my daughter who was a baby to uh
Illinois at the time to zero morning and
I funded it myself
you know I did not know how else to do
this and I just was like well I believe
this is an important story
um nobody even though this editor was
interested they&#39;re not funding any of
these expenses
a lot of times nowadays I still have to
fund things up front I don&#39;t know if you
all have to do that and sometimes it
takes a month it&#39;s taken over a year in
some cases to get a lot of this money
um and that is something that I think
people are having more sophisticated
conversations Freelancers about working
that into any contract ahead of time
that travel expense
um child care expenses like that we know
we&#39;re going to have to put up if we&#39;re
going to travel to do a long form piece
um you know it was just I put a lot of
risk and I put a lot of it on myself
again because I did not have a network I
did not know what else to do and I
didn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t get anybody to pay
attention to me so I&#39;m like well I&#39;m
gonna do the story no matter what but
nowadays I think you know I have to plan
out okay I have this Fellowship I have
this grant that&#39;s going to cover some of
this funding for travel for records for
child care
um you know all of this has to be sorted
or I can have that worked out with an
editor and even I think in conversations
with you khaki maybe people have said
you know you can have that paid out
front the travel which you know you
still have to fight for today you know
even a big publication
um to get them to pay that before the
thing is published because the thing can
get published in a year and you still
have lost all that money for traveling
so I just think that&#39;s just logistically
something that is important to think
about too
um I can I can add a bit to that
um also a lot of you that that series
you did for USA Today Was really amazing
um I remember reading that
um when I was doing some research on
parole life
uh man it&#39;s I I really think there could
be a whole conference just centered on
like how do you sustain long form it is
truly difficult and everything
um Erica and a lot of you guys have
talked about so far resonates so deeply
um I can add just like
I guess a few lessons slash tools that I
use on a regular basis
one thing that was really instrumental
for me and I don&#39;t know if you would say
the same Erica
um but the first piece I did like
Looking Back Now on my first year as a
freelancer I spent a year and a half
reporting my first long-form
um story I had written one feature while
I was at Mother Jones
um and that did help and the reporting
that I had done the beat reporting I had
done while on stuff certainly helped me
a lot
um and in terms of starting to build
editor connections outside of
um outside of The Newsroom I had been at
um but now I kind of look back on my
first on that first piece I did it was
for California Sunday
um also California Sunday rip and we can
talk more about the importance of
Publications that like really you know
rely on Freelancers and give them their
um major byline
um for a long form
um that I feel like that&#39;s probably
gotten harder today than six years ago
um but now I look at that first piece as
really an investment and it became
really a calling card for me to then be
able to and it you know I always thought
after I wrote this piece it was very
difficult it was about a mother who was
grieving her son had been killed by the
um and I followed her grief process for
a year and a half and wrote about it
when that was done I thought that was an
outlier there&#39;s no way there&#39;s no way
I&#39;m gonna spend a year and a half
um reporting stories it&#39;s just not how
how would that be possible and little
did I know at the time that that was
actually the norm
um I&#39;m not saying every long form piece
takes a year and a half to report but
the general timeline at least for myself
and it you know I think take it with a
grain of salt for those of you listening
because every freelancer&#39;s life and and
juggle and balance looks a bit different
um but it it has actually become a norm
like I have spent on and off up to three
years reporting a story
um and and so you know I think
investing in that first piece can be
really important and can open a lot of
um setting expectations with yourself
that when you sort of
become passionate about an idea and you
know there&#39;s something more there and
you want to
um investigate it further look for
sources and you become passionate about
a potential story just know that if it
takes you a very long time upwards of a
year or more that is okay that is like
you are not slow you are not you know
incompetent or lesser
um because our new cycle moves so
quickly I think you know I often have
had like anxiety induced weeks where I&#39;m
like I haven&#39;t published anything in a
really long time and it&#39;s taken me years
to kind of
start to accept that as just my case and
that that is okay
um logistically because a long-form
project can take so long for myself
I now sort of I have always been a big
spreadsheets person
um and so I use spreadsheets and to-do
lists to track everything now when I
start a new project I start
um a spreadsheet for keeping track of
sources I start developing a list of
names contact information when I last
reached out to them who to reach out to
um I have a spreadsheet
for just for fellowships and deadlines
and how much money it provides
um what like types of stories they&#39;re
generally looking for
editor contacts just to keep track of
everyone I&#39;ve been in touch with
and I also have start I have started
keeping more recently
um like a diary of my reporting just so
that I can do a little mental dump after
each day of research
um and then I&#39;ll also say like pitching
especially in the beginning and even now
I will say like I&#39;m on contract this
year for the first time with the Times
I&#39;ve still I&#39;ve gotten rejections this
um it it&#39;s gotten a little bit easier
but I will I would not go as far as
saying it&#39;s a walk in the park now it&#39;s
not pitching is just so hard
this field is just really really
um and so that just no rejections things
taking a very long time like that is
um I have actually I try it&#39;s still a
struggle but I I try to look at the
pitching process
um more as practice than anything else
and a way to remind editors that I&#39;m
still here and that I&#39;m interested in a
particular idea
that tends to soften the blow a bit when
the answer is no or the answer is this
is interesting but we just did something
somewhat similar that you know is not
that similar
um but there&#39;s so much in our industry
that like one individual freelance
writer cannot control
um and so a lot of a lot of the battle I
think is like you know overcoming your
expectations and fears and anxieties and
insecurities it&#39;s it&#39;s a work in
oh my gosh so much of that resonates
with me since I&#39;m right now trying to
pitch a long-term story and it has been
three years since you know or two years
two years since I started reporting it
um and I had one editor tell me well I
was pitching a story about Airway health
and they said well we&#39;ve written a story
about Keith this year I&#39;m like it&#39;s okay
I guess you can&#39;t do two stories that
involve teeth or faces or Airways
Valeria what would you add to that
no I am also thinking
um about the side that I&#39;ve seen as an
editor now and uh people come to me
they&#39;ve been pitching to a lot of places
and they discover palabra and they&#39;ve
already like incurred into I can see
lots of expenses and they&#39;ve traveled
internationally and
frankly I don&#39;t know how I did it I
don&#39;t know how they do it so one of the
things that I try to encourage them is
to seek fellowships to recover some of
the expenses for that trouble uh you
know like the Pulitzer Center is a good
place the international women&#39;s media
Foundation is very supportive uh the
fund for investigative journalism is
another great place I am a member of the
board there and we really want to see
more diversity in the applications so I
think that those are some of the things
that I learned that really helped me
um frankly it is hard and I think what
we&#39;re most of us are saying is
uh because of the time involvement
because of all the resources it requires
you know you&#39;re kind of like a business
uh even when you want to pitch you do
have to make this initial investment of
hours and hours of reporting maybe you
even pay a researcher which is something
that Jaya recommended to me and so all
of those things you need to have a pot
of funds to be able to sustain yourself
so uh someone was asking about the
balance uh I think yeah one thing for me
was like okay no more than once non-form
story per year
and also
choosing carefully how much energy I was
going to put into each project because
those of us who love long form as we
were discussing earlier we want to turn
everything into long form and not
everything has to be and so sometimes we
are our worst enemies because of how
dedicated we are so you have to say no
this is this is what I&#39;m being paid for
this is as far as I will go and this is
where the story is added that that&#39;s you
have to kind of come to compromise this
with yourself uh I love really like when
I hear you Jaya the fact that you carve
time to write a diary at the end of the
like that is like a huge success in time
management like you are making that
space I I was working for a while so
cramped so crammed like that like being
able to like you know get things off my
chest sometimes the way I did that is
like I wrote to a friendly editor hey
you know I know you&#39;re not necessarily
taking my pitch but let me tell you
about all the reporting I did on this
trip like you know so I could just like
get it out somehow so anyways let&#39;s
learn fellowships uh help and then also
ask ask the Publications hey you know I
invested a lot like how much could you
put here to reverse me for for these uh
trips for the transcripts for gas don&#39;t
be afraid to ask don&#39;t be afraid to ask
uh I am a friendly editor so for the
most part I often tend to say yes or try
to help you find the resources but yeah
do not be afraid
Valeria I love it um I and it resonates
also my first long-form piece was in
2010 and I was like oh I&#39;ve done it now
I&#39;m gonna have so many assignments and
then it took me till 2015 to have my
second piece and I was so excited when I
got that pitch accepted that I forgot to
ask for reimbursement for expenses but I
just emailed the editor at Mother Jones
I said I forgot to ask I know I signed a
contract but I spent nine hundred
dollars can you reimburse me and she
said yes so it really doesn&#39;t hurt to
ask and I think the editors understand I
had one editor tell me when I cold
pitched him and he accepted it and I was
happy he said there&#39;s only a couple
dozen people in this country who can
even do long-form journalism who can see
a project through to completion so
you&#39;re more valuable than you know and
that was also very validating
um so we earlier we talked the the issue
of contracts came up I would love to
hear from folks about in particular for
a long-form project is there anything
you should look for
um or ask to have included in the
contract for a long-form project any red
don&#39;t let them take your movie rights
and book rights and all that and I
learned that um even when I was
uh freelance editing for a place that I
didn&#39;t know their contract situation I
just knew the writers and um I know that
I had there was one writer who had been
working I think it was the Memoir piece
and went to an MFA and didn&#39;t know when
she signed the contract that she&#39;d find
away the rights for a like a book and
all these things
um and it wasn&#39;t for a lot of money you
know and so
um every place now it seems will work to
get those right uh
from you and
um you know that&#39;s something that you
don&#39;t always win the fight unfortunately
um but be very aware of like
you know the fact that I mean I&#39;ve
certainly screwed myself in that area
several times too actually
um and you just have to be very careful
about the language because a lot of
places now see that as um they try to do
a right scrab
and I have an agent that helps negotiate
with the with for that other people have
lawyers other people can do that
themselves and have done that
successfully maybe yeah I don&#39;t know if
you want to talk about you a little bit
but but it is something to really pay
attention to
yeah for sure I think I think the rights
battle is the kind of like
you know uh the Battle of today the
contract battle for Freelancers of today
I I
yeah it&#39;s so funny because you know we
all only work with a certain number of
Publications so it&#39;s hard to know like
exactly where things are shifting I
would like to think that
there you know
ice well I still see this Clause but um
the one that like is you always watch
out for is the indemnification Clause
um which sort of
khaki or anyone else on this panel who
any other panelists who want to correct
me but basically it it sort of depending
on how it&#39;s written it can give you more
or less legal protection in in the
instance that in the off chance that
there&#39;s a lawsuit
um that arises from the story that&#39;s a
big one I look for definitely the rights
um usually you&#39;ll see the phrase uh
if you see the phrase work for hire or
if you see the phrase
derivative derivatives and if it seems
the publication is trying to own those
rights that&#39;s a red flag
um I have had many and I&#39;m I&#39;m still in
the middle of contract negotiations that
have been going on for months mostly
just waiting to hear back
um and continuing to report the story in
the meantime not knowing if this is all
going to work out or not
um uh this is this story is not
currently with the times uh which has a
fairly decent contract
two things that helped me a lot with
um just because you know we&#39;re not
lawyers and I think that&#39;s where
Publications tend to get away with
grabbing rights or not paying enough or
having terms that favor them more that
is just you know it&#39;s not necessarily A
malicious thing
um but it&#39;s it&#39;s part of of the business
side of things and so have if you are
able to Outsource that if you have a
friend who&#39;s a lawyer if you have
freelancer friends who can look help you
look over those contracts
um I have from time to time not for
every contract but I&#39;ve paid a lawyer
who I was introduced to through another
freelancer friend here in the bay
um he&#39;s pretty badass and just having
the confidence and the security of
knowing someone is here yes you&#39;re
paying them but someone is here to back
you up
um and helping you navigate some
complicated legal language that&#39;s just a
huge mental load and you can that way
you can focus on the reporting
um so I that&#39;s definitely one benefit
um also the uh I&#39;m sure I know khaki is
all over this with with the iij
um also the freelance investigative
reporters and editors you can email them
and I&#39;ll send you if you join their
email list they&#39;ll send you a template
um for uh like what a what a a good
um contract looks like for a freelance
um so that&#39;s another good resource that
I&#39;d recommend
I just want to say very quickly that a
lot of Publications get away with the
things in their contract because people
are eager to publish
right they want to be in a certain
publication or they want and so
sometimes they
Overlook these really important things
in the contract because they&#39;re just so
excited that this publication accepted
my pitch accepted my idea I am going to
be able to write this you know very
important impactful piece without you
know and so they sign on the dotted line
without actually uh realizing what what
it says but I I really think uh
I don&#39;t say people uh Publications prey
on people&#39;s desire to be to be published
but people do want to be published and
some people just they don&#39;t read the
whole the whole contract because it&#39;s
the excitement of actually you know how
I finally did it I finally was able to
to get this publication to notice me and
they accepted my pitch and I&#39;m writing
for them
unfortunately
yes I have had the experience of um
pushing back at a contract and being
told oh we&#39;ll give you the other
I&#39;m like oh the writer friendly one okay
thanks next time can you just give it to
me first the first time instead of me
having to ask for it so yeah
um so we have so many questions we have
good questions coming in
um in the chat I think I&#39;m gonna take
some from the Q a because there are so
many and I wonder if we could do a speed
a sort of visual answer here because
there are couples like quantitative uh
questions so if everyone could hold up a
finger how many long-form stories can
you work on at a time one two three four
oh my gosh Jaya and Erica I my brain
only has room for one mine too
and then
um in a year how many could you do so my
answer will be the same
one interesting
okay very cool
um and then we had some questions about
where do you get your ideas
um how do you decide which one to
prioritize
and then how much pre-reporting do you
do before you know it&#39;s ready to pitch
I already told you guys how I get my my
project idea for for my my recidivism
project it started off with just in my
everyday reporting on the criminal
justice system I want a statistic stood
out for me and that&#39;s how I got the idea
to do a long form project around
recidivism uh and Jaya and I both were
uh fund for investigative journalism
diversity fellows and I see one of our
other fellow mates Sonya Paul is is on
the line
um and so
just pitching that piece I just that
that statistic was disturbing to me and
that&#39;s how I got that idea
just ask why that&#39;s like why is this the
way it is
um I would say when it&#39;s some
I went to a really wonderful panel at
asja that was titled something like
Falls and Weirdos and like saying
basically those are really good Central
characters so I do think when I find a
Don Quixote type you know who&#39;s just
like on a mission like I I tend to write
a lot of solutions journalism so that
can often be a really good Central
character I&#39;d be curious the other three
you do do you start with the character
the idea the topic
you just stay quickly I think about it
in a couple different ways like I&#39;m
often shifting like the way my life goes
too like what are my interests I think
that&#39;s a great part of being an
independent journalist you can just
write about what you&#39;re super curious
and fascinated about in that period of
your life but I often think of like
finding it on the macro level first like
here&#39;s the big idea how do I tell this
is a narrative though and then that
requires finding the people finding the
people who tell that story right but
sometimes you just encounter people who
are larger than life and then you&#39;re
trying to figure out how do I pitch this
to a place that understands that there&#39;s
a macro
um kind of big picture story here too
that&#39;s magazine worthy because you&#39;re
all you often have to prove what is the
newsworthy uh
you know part of this story why do we
need this right now
um and also just looking into your into
your own life sometimes and thinking
about what are they what are the issues
that I feel personally affected by or
you know that I&#39;m just really working
out myself and then who are the people
that maybe I could continue these
conversations with and have
um you know learn from that as well uh
and so I&#39;m always
kind of Shifting my focus around but
it&#39;s always there&#39;s common themes that
often run through my work but that&#39;s
sort of how I I think about finding Dory
I wanted to share that a great
frustration of mine is that there are
periods in my life I had all these ideas
right just way too many the problem is I
couldn&#39;t like really like land them
because I just had so finally I attended
a workshop on immigration at Berkeley
ages ago I came back and I said this is
sit I&#39;m not letting go any single one of
this so I grabbed like printer papers
and I wrote All okay this is a story put
it on the wall and so I filled my my
wall in my house with all these
different story ideas that I wanted to
do and then I went like okay it was
maybe just a word right like children in
detention or or you know Asylum seeking
children after what happens to them once
they arrive and and
and then I I went for them there was
something about putting them in the
world that made them tangible
um and I think you know maybe keeping it
in a Google doc or something uh because
it might feel like the the fountain
drains that you have no ideas but you
actually do it&#39;s just that you don&#39;t
peen them and you have to uh to see them
so that you can come back to them when
you are like I have no idea oh here it
is you have plenty of ideas and usually
like and I find them usually through
um being out there reporting leads me to
find ideas
So currently I&#39;m not doing a whole lot
of reporting so the ideas that I have
are inspired by the work other people
are doing pretty much
um Valeria also you put some great uh
information into the chat but it was
only to the panelists if you could copy
and send it to everyone that would be
um I&#39;m guessing Erica when you met when
you learned of twins who were separated
through adoption and then one of the
twins who has adopted in America had
another sister who was adopted that you
were like must write
thank you
yeah I mean that was that was also
obviously born out of like where was I
at in my life at that point I had I have
a mother of twins so I was
you know researching between science and
led me to different um twin Pairs and
then this one in particular I became
especially
um drawn to I will say just you
mentioned earlier um
tacky about like getting pitched or you
pitch stories and sometimes they say
well I already did that story and in the
book world I will say that also occurs
and it&#39;s really frustrating and hard I
when we were pitching this book idea uh
there were many rejections and one of
the rejections was what we just did the
Twins were reported in Vietnam and
separated at Birth
one of the rejections was well we
already just bought a book about among
rice Farmer and the two ideas just
couldn&#39;t be you know more similar
they&#39;re not that similar but they seem
too similar and you know those are the
kind of rejections that that you receive
in the book world and so it&#39;s even more
um sometimes and ridiculous
um you know I I can&#39;t say that the book
world was changing I know that there&#39;s a
lot of there&#39;s a lot of people
interesting and trying to change and you
know that and inclusion for more diverse
book but certainly when I tried to um
Pitch this book I was running into that
yeah but we&#39;ve already had an Asian book
this year so no room for any more
just another reminder somewhere sisters
available everywhere books are sold
um there&#39;s so many good questions I&#39;m
gonna ask a sort of a combination given
that long-form journalism as a
freelancer doesn&#39;t guarantee Financial
Security how do each of you balance the
other work that you do alongside this
particularly how do you avoid being
brain fried and overworked and
is there anything you&#39;d add about how
this whole process and this field is
inherently exploitative of us
so the beauty of long-form journalists
is they think about their answer before
they jump in so I&#39;ll just give mine
which is that it&#39;s changed over the 14
years that I&#39;ve been a freelancer I used
to do a fair amount of editing
um for non-profits and
um and that gave me sort of a different
thing to use my brain for that didn&#39;t
tax the same skills as working on
long-form work now I do a fair amount of
speed uh speaking paid not speed
I do a fair amount of paid speaking and
that subsidizes a long-form journalism
and I really do think that I prioritize
prioritize downtime because it&#39;s so it
hurts my brain to do long-form
journalism and so my brain has to be at
its best so I just don&#39;t know how to do
it being brainfied and so I just make
sure that I am not
yeah I&#39;ve had to do therapy
so and that&#39;s not just because of the
you know how you do feel exploited a lot
of times that it is so incredibly hard
but then you&#39;re often working on these
stories that are traumatic I know I have
and I know everybody here had
and so these stories you live with them
for years like Valeria was saying
earlier and it just it becomes you know
it&#39;s part of you
and you&#39;re trying to hold them with such
care so
um I think uh the other thing that I try
to do is just I&#39;ve just really had to
remind myself when I was a reporter at
the LA Times I thought that that was my
identity a lot I mean I was in my 20s
and I thought this I&#39;ve made it and this
is who I am and everywhere I go I&#39;m a
reporter of a reporter and then you
leave and you realize
um you know that life is sort of behind
you and now you&#39;re separated and
um I&#39;ve just had to learn you know that
that&#39;s one part I know that we&#39;ve heard
this before but what you&#39;re doing is one
part of your identity even writing a
book it&#39;s like one part of this whole
you know career path that you&#39;re on that
this whole many body the many things
that you&#39;re going to produce your body
of work plus your life your mother being
a mother all the friends you have
hopefully you have friends and family
who you know maybe they&#39;re proud of you
that you do these things but they don&#39;t
always know exactly what you do that&#39;s
kind of how much family at some time and
um but they love you no matter what and
that&#39;s what&#39;s important like it just
grounds you
um and I think that&#39;s really important
to just have
you know realize that your identity is
many things and it&#39;s not just this work
even though this work is so important to
I I can add a bit just I&#39;m constantly
thinking about priorities
um in both my personal life and work
life and I think it&#39;s a habit that&#39;s
like bled over from just like being a
freelancer I&#39;ll do another plug for like
the account of having an accountability
um Katie and I Loosely follow a
philosophy called the one thing where
um the one thing is usually the
long-form story for both of us
and we are just every year month and
week we are looking at
um what&#39;s like what is the kind of small
step you&#39;re going to take today or this
week to inch toward publishing your your
long-form idea and then everything else
the making the money the taking care of
your kid my husband and I take care of
um his Elder and and also my parents and
we have a whole ecosystem going like you
know as Eric is saying we are more than
just like people churning out stories
and I think recognizing that about
um and then kind of
knowing that there is this goal you&#39;re
trying to meet
um and that you will eventually get
there I think part part of the reality
of why these stories take so long
um is because you have to do that juggle
in between that&#39;s why like most many of
us are saying one story maybe per year I
think if you&#39;re publishing one per year
that&#39;s actually pretty damn good
um pretty fast actually
um but just kind of like keeping in mind
and and building your schedule out
around this priority whether it&#39;s you&#39;re
spending 10 minutes a day thinking about
um 10 minutes just writing a few emails
um if that&#39;s all you can afford
but just having that kind of structure
has been like really important and
instrumental for for my own work and
thank you Jaya Lottie or Valeria did you
want to add
to that
oops I think you&#39;re muted Lottie sorry
okay can you hear me now there you go
okay I just want to say for many years I
worked for a quarterly
right which only publishes four times a
year with which gave me the space in
time to work on Long freelance long form
so I had that advantage of uh having an
income coming in in that the publication
I worked for was a quarterly so that was
a really big thing number two I&#39;d really
do believe that at times you mentioned
in a question about being exploitative
right I just remember doing
a big piece for a major mainstream
publication I was so excited because I
was like oh I&#39;m going to be in this
publication
and I got so
much work and I tried to negotiate with
the editors like hey I talked to the
Department of Justice and I did this and
I had to download this and
and I think I got maybe a hundred
dollars more
and I&#39;m just like oh my God but I think
it&#39;s you know they know people want to
be in those big name mainstream
Publications and I feel like is it in
some cases it could be exploitative in
that uh in terms of the in terms of the
rate uh
but I used it in in my clips now when
it&#39;s one of my calling cards so
and they bet on that they&#39;re like hey
you&#39;re gonna have the opportunity to put
us on your resume right and show other
Publications this clip this big story
that you did right and so they&#39;re like
hey so you know what are you complaining
about you get to put us on on your
resume and in your Clips that&#39;s
happening to me right now that&#39;s the
conversation I&#39;m having with the client
right now
um and and I and I do think it&#39;s helpful
to raise we talked about this in our
pre-planning call my three p&#39;s model
that any assignment should pay well
be for your passion or something that
you really are excited about or be for
your portfolio and ideally more than one
you know but but you need to know what&#39;s
the reason and then you know stay
accountable to that so
um quick question uh if anyone has a
suggestion of Publications that are
better for Less well-known writers to
get interested or get engaged with long
form or other Publications I know we&#39;ve
talked about Cal Sunday and Pacific
Standard and some of the ones that are
gone but anything new in long form that
excites you guys or that you&#39;d recommend
people look at as a possible Outlet
what about places like net narratively
or places like long reads
um I&#39;m not quite sure if they&#39;re rates
because I haven&#39;t written for them
before but I do know that they they are
long-form pieces and they accept a lot
of freelance
a lot of freelance he says
I did just hear from it
eratively that they&#39;re looking for
cinematic ideas they&#39;re looking for
anything that can be a podcast movie or
Netflix spin-off
and they pay a dollar a word I believe
I&#39;m a big fan of the advents I don&#39;t
know if that I think you probably
I think they just want great ideas too
um and they have a great editor Katya
who&#39;s on the chat found an incredible
pizza to them and so and they pay well I
think it would help cover expenses and
everything
um I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily I
don&#39;t know how but if they go by
credentials or just how great your pitch
um but that&#39;s a one that I really
and I think catapult May accept
long-form stories uh as well are you
guys familiar with catapult
they have really good pieces
yeah I think of them as more essays than
okay journalism but I think there&#39;s a
lot of crossover
um so a couple questions coming in about
pitching can each of you address how do
you how much pre-reporting you do right
and sort of maybe when you know it&#39;s
ready to pitch and then anything about
like how long that pitch is how much
you&#39;ve put into it and you know how do
you find the right match for where to
pitch it
generally for a long form pitch
um I usually I used to do a lot of
reporting and
um when I was trying to break in I I
really would have
kind of done uh
extensive reporting they get a pitch in
um I realize now that&#39;s not really the
best way to do it because you don&#39;t
always know if you&#39;re gonna get the
story sold and
um uh it&#39;s you know hard on time but um
now but I think for a long form pitch
always I do have
like sort of a central person at least
um identified that I&#39;ve
gained access to
um and the idea of how the story will be
a narrative and so my pitches tend to
run long and um
longer than maybe
you know one pitches I can even I&#39;ll
share a pitch
Katya did once for Neiman um but and I
also think uh if you haven&#39;t yet
connected to the open notebook the pitch
database that&#39;s incredibly helpful
um they have a whole pitch database with
different pictures for different
Publications and magazines and what
actually became uh magazine pieces and I
often use that when I&#39;m teaching and
having students try to practice pitching
too and I do think it&#39;s helpful to have
reporting to make sure that you have
access so that you don&#39;t look like a
fool if you get the assignment
I want to say this about pitching
when I was the editor of the crisis
magazine I received so many pitches that
did not fit my publication
it&#39;s like people had not read the
publication and they did not know what
we were about they just knew we were a
historical publication and but they they
pitched something that uh was not good
for the publication
and so be very very very very familiar
with this publication before pitching
them you know the angle and perspective
that they are interested in
uh what kind of what kind of publication
it is who the pitch
uh you know someone said oh I wrote this
long pitch and I was rejected uh I I I
would reject
I will reject pictures because they had
my name wrong like they would put jet
magazines editor okay picture to me
right so make sure you get that I&#39;m
saying things everyone already knows but
I&#39;m just going to review make sure you
have the editor&#39;s name correct make sure
that you are familiar with the
publication uh and that what you want to
pitch fits that publication uh we were
not business we were not lifestyle we
were social issues political issues
black history you know uh
art of culture some some culture not a
lot of culture
we did very little entertainment until
there was the NAACP image Awards right
but you know I just I really encourage
people to become extremely familiar with
the the platform you want to pitch and
you know people want to know why are you
the best person to do this story have
you done anything you know in terms of
pre-reporting what else have you done on
this issue as I said earlier my
wheelhouse is the Civil Rights Movement
I&#39;ve been writing about that for 20 plus
years so when I write a pitch I include
all the links not all of them but so at
least five links to my previous to other
stories that I&#39;ve done for other
Publications around civil rights just so
they they could number one see my
writing style number two to show them
that I have been published in major
mainstream Publications in that I have
the capacity and experience to do this
work that&#39;s another thing when you pitch
they want to know that you can do it you
know they want to know that you can do
the story that you are pitching so I
showed them these are the other stories
that I&#39;ve done and these you know and
these are the places where they were
published uh and so people want to know
that editors want being an editor I want
to know where else have you been
published what else have you done what
else have you written about this subject
you know and why are you the person to
do this we have really great I have
great ideas I&#39;m like I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m
the right person to do this story right
uh but I I think we should look at that
one pitching don&#39;t pitch it because you
want to be published in a certain
potentially because you believe you can
do the story it&#39;s an important story you
feel that it has a a big impact and that
um you you have the resources to like
sometimes I say I will interview this
person this person this person right or
I will interview this sometimes I I
throw that in sometimes not but
sometimes sometimes some editors want to
know well who do you have access to that
you can pull this off what resources are
you going to use uh and I think that&#39;s
very important
um when pitching yes Lottie so much of
that resonates we only have six minutes
left I&#39;m gonna ask each person to just
share one final thought and in the
meantime there&#39;s so much good stuff in
the chat I really recommend everyone
look at the I&#39;ll try to save it and send
it out in next next newsletter
um if those of you who are here I feel
like the audience has had as so much to
contribute as well if you could each
share one thing you heard today that
encouraged you or that was new or that
you&#39;re going to take away that was
helpful I&#39;d love to see people put in
the chat something that one of our
panelists said that was useful or that
you&#39;ll you&#39;ll learn you&#39;ll learn from
today and then I would just Echo what
Lottie said that when you pitch and also
what Erica said I think when I pitch a
long-form story it&#39;s usually 800 900
words and you sort of write it like
you&#39;d write the article I usually read
two or three issues of the magazine to
sort of get the voice and the pace and
the style in my head before I sit down
to write and then explain the answers to
three questions that every editor needs
to know why this story for my audience
so you need to show you know the
audience and that this is relevant and
they haven&#39;t already covered it
to why now so why is this urgent or is
there a newspeg or some reason they
should yet say yesterday and why me you
know do what access do I have what
background and Reporting I have why am I
the person only person who could
possibly pull out this story and as
Erica said I do outline you know I see
this as like these are the central
characters these are the kind of scenes
I would include just so that they have a
sense that I have a narrative Arc that
it&#39;s not just going to be a mess when I
turn it in
um and then I will just ask as a final
question I see Valeria had had something
to add so I&#39;ll go first to Valeria and
would like to hear from each of you what
do you love about long form so why do
you put yourself through this and want
to live in this world or you know is
there anything that really makes you
feel like this is a form of Journalism
really worth doing
oh I love it it&#39;s because of the
of how he transforms me as a human
to spend time and learn and bear witness
to other people&#39;s experiences and that&#39;s
like why I love journalism because I
want to be exposed to what it does to me
as a human
um and then I just wanted to say trust
your God all of you here who are in a
lot of form who are like putting your
money up front to do things you really
have a passion and you really have a
commitment and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing it
for the right reasons trust your God
because if that publication that you&#39;re
hoping for doesn&#39;t work there will be
another one that&#39;s gonna want it just
trust your God and also be willing to
just don&#39;t be hard-headed about it
sometimes you have to Pivot sometimes
the story is not what you thought it had
to be and if you are too hard-headed
you&#39;re going to be stuck so I just
wanted to say that and keep up your good
um I I would say
um I think that
uh I think that I love long form because
you know it helps me answer the question
or try seek to answer
um questions about
what it means to just be a human to be
honest and and and I think that a lot of
us put a lot of pressure on ourselves to
do stories that maybe might change
society or change quality in some way
um and sometimes you know we&#39;re 10 years
later and things are still happening and
that can feel very frustrating and so
one piece of advice that I have always
taken with me is that we are trying to
you know part the curtain on Humanity
we&#39;re trying to you know give these
human experiences and make people feel
something in our writing and so whether
I&#39;m reading the long-form work of
everybody on this panel in the audience
uh the people that I admire I keep you
know when I was a really young reporter
I would keep like file folders of
different writers that I just loved
different journalists
to keep just as inspiration and um I
think that that&#39;s what kind of just
keeps me going through all of the ups
and downs
um and and
so Erica can you also share just briefly
your first long form this being on the
bus with the girl
my first long-form peas ever
the one where you were at the LA times
and you were on the bus with a girl
going to visit yeah so that was just so
that&#39;s the other thing I want to say I
guess is a good point you don&#39;t have to
think of long form as 10 000 words and
when I was on staff at the LA Times I
was learning how to just do narrative
sometimes and I had a weekend assignment
and um the assignment was to cover a
Mother&#39;s Day story and it was so I you
know there were kids going to visit
their mothers in prison and to turn that
into a narrative
um I decided to spend the evening before
with this teenager she&#39;s going to the
um before the day before she was going
to go on the bus for six hours to meet
her mother so that she&#39;d done this many
times she puts on these like fabulous
gold earrings she picked them out bamboo
earrings she&#39;s gonna you know she has
her whole outfit plotted out I ride the
bus with her at six in the morning the
next day she was like writing rap lyrics
and I&#39;m just like witnessing this she
gets to the prison they say you can&#39;t
wear those earrings and her grandma had
told her you&#39;re not going to get those
earring past security to get them in
um as everybody&#39;s saying goodbye to her
or to their parents at the end of the
visit all the children are crying and
she&#39;s 16 and she&#39;s like you know not
crying at all and looking around around
um and she just sort of leaves the
prison she&#39;s done this before she has
her earrings intact but the whole thing
was really to me a coming-of-age story
and that was something you know a small
Source but it&#39;s a way to turn a weekend
to find out something that maybe is like
feeling like a daily into something with
these emotions these details that you
report with the um it&#39;s a human story
and so I live for those I love those and
it&#39;s such a privilege to be able to tell
those whether it&#39;s in that form or in
the book
thank you Lottie Jaya what do you love
about this format
but first I want to mention something
that I didn&#39;t mention earlier and I
would like you know all of our uh all of
those who are joining us on the zoom to
research fellowships
because uh
journalismjobs.com has a list of
Journalism fellowships I want to mention
that one someone who wrote a story for
me about uh how Medicaid uh
contributed to the bankruptcy of nursing
homes in black neighborhoods in
Pittsburgh and he had five different
fellowships to write this story
including the fund for investigative
journalism fellowship and including the
Alicia Patterson Fellowship which I
think pays upward of maybe forty
thousand dollars that&#39;s like a big
Fellowship so he had five fellowships to
write this piece
um but it but in terms of what I love
most uh about this form is just being
able to go deep and being able to
connect uh with someone that you&#39;re not
able to connect with just doing like a
quick hit I remember two pieces I&#39;m
gonna say them very briefly I wrote a a
piece called Wednesdays in Mississippi
that they actually received a award for
the National Association of black
journalists it was a little-known factor
the civil rights movement that black and
white women joined together and rode
buses to the South uh to help distribute
uh supplies to Freedom Summer Schools in
the Deep South and I had never heard
about this program I&#39;m from Mississippi
I&#39;m from the Deep South so it&#39;s an
opportunity to learn uh about little
known facts that you&#39;ve never uh knew
before but also to connect with people I
can recall earlier this year someone who
was featured in my recital business
story sent me an email and she was one
who had been in and out of jail over the
past five ten years and she said Lottie
I have not returned to prison I have a
job and I have an apartment I was like
Wow and she said I&#39;m off drugs I&#39;m on
the right path I get to see my chill
children and I&#39;m like that&#39;s the type of
impact that we want to make right um she
we did her story and she got her she
said I want to get my life together she
had as I said it had been in and out of
jail for more than a decade she had lost
custody of her children she was on drugs
but for her to send me that email I have
a job I have an apartment I can see my
kids I&#39;m off drugs that made me smile
and that&#39;s one of the reasons why I do
this uh do this work
love it Lottie Jaya
oh so much
um left to say
um and yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s all very
powerful words everyone
um one thing I&#39;ve been trying to tell
myself these days a lot is is to shift
my thinking
from your only valuable you know the
whole the whole um saying in our Fields
um of like you&#39;re only as good as your
last byline like I think there&#39;s a lot
of unlearning we have to do oftentimes
um you know especially if you&#39;re coming
up and
um toxic or semi-toxic or accidental
unintentionally toxic work cultures
um and something I&#39;m trying to tell
myself these days is that you know like
if you get to practice long form you
know if you&#39;re making time for it and
you&#39;re going at it and showing up for
the work every day that is living the
um doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re like you
know the last six months have only been
rejections the fact that
um I feel like six years in which is not
that long especially compared to some of
us on the call
um but I think it&#39;s been enough time for
me to see enough cycles of long-form
projects of my own to realize that if I
keep at it eventually I will get to the
point where I&#39;m like out there reporting
the story
um eventually there will be a
publication and editor I want to work
with I there have been projects that
I&#39;ve had to give up on and I think
Valeria&#39;s Point earlier about like
knowing when to Pivot that could be a
whole other people probably
um but just kind of for me the the
mental shift from like it is a privilege
for me to get to do this work rather
than like why is this so hard because I
I&#39;ve been on both sides and again it&#39;s a
battle almost daily
um but it is true you know and I I just
got back from Cleveland recently to
report on a story about
um Family caregivers and I myself am one
and sitting there spending a week with
this daughter and mom uh and to be able
to connect with her and relate to each
other and
to feel like
you know not only do you have this
opportunity to restore some dignity in
this ordinary person&#39;s life who&#39;s doing
extraordinary things
um that I mean it&#39;s that feeling is
Indescribable I think
um and so
you know that the times or the number of
days in my year where I get to
experience that feeling are so few and
far between but it does when I&#39;m in it
um and right now I&#39;m in sort of my other
favorite part of the process which is
just like actually sitting down and
writing and getting to be creative
um but I think the nature of any
creative work is is is quite hard and in
journalism it&#39;s especially hard
um so
you know it is it is worth it and I
think the way we kind of Define our
value is is really important
thank you so much Jaya yeah I hope we
can do some unlearning here at the
institute for independent journalists
because that&#39;s certainly how I came up
literally in The Newsroom they would say
You&#39;re only as good as your last byline
so um there&#39;s so much in the chat about
people wanting to stay connected
um I will try to let&#39;s see Erica would
you be willing to maybe create a Google
doc and put it in the chat and then
people can fill in email addresses and
um and I met Erica mailman not Erica
um people can fill in their email
addresses and
um and names so that we can stay in
touch because I do think connecting with
each other is one way to sustain energy
for the work I certainly feel so
inspired after this conversation so
thank you so much
