There is a new type of fake NDE content
that has been popping up all over
YouTube and thousands of people are
taking it seriously. The rise of AI
generated content. Stories that are fake
from start to finish. The story is fake.
The person telling the story is fake and
people are falling for it. And so what
I&#39;m going to do today is I&#39;m going to
show you what a couple of these channels
look like, what their content looks
like, and how you can avoid being
hoodwinkedked by these channels.
Hello, my name is Melissa with Love
Covered Life podcast and typically I
interview NDE experiencers, but today
we&#39;re going to do something a little
different. Today I&#39;m going to be doing a
reaction video to something that&#39;s
happening in the NDE space that I think
everybody needs to be aware of. There is
a new type of fake NDE content that has
been popping up all over YouTube and
thousands of people are taking it
seriously. Let me backtrack. When I
first started interviewing near-death
experiencers back in January of 2021,
there were only a handful of NDE
podcasts in the field, such as NDE
Radio, We Don&#39;t Die Radio, Buddha at the
Gas Pump. NDEs were not a widely
accepted phenomenon. And those people
who were sharing their stories, you knew
they were authentic because they often
risked alienating everybody in their
life by coming out publicly with their
NDE account. Within the first couple of
years that I started interviewing
near-death experiencers, there were
several other podcast hosts who started,
I don&#39;t know, generally speaking, around
the same time that I did. More and more
people were starting podcasts
interviewing near-death experiencers and
spiritual experiencers. And we&#39;ve seen
the benefits of this in society with
NDEs becoming more widely recognized and
accepted. Now, when I tell people what I
do for a living, when people ask me,
&#34;What do you do?&#34; And I say, &#34;I&#39;m a
podcaster. I interview near-death
experiencers.&#34; People are interested.
They get excited. they either have a
personal story to share or somebody that
they know has had an NDE or an after-
deathath communication or they want to
hear some of my stories and about the
guests that I&#39;ve interviewed. So, we&#39;ve
seen this really positive shift in
society. Along with that, of course,
comes the downsides. There&#39;s positives
and negatives to everything. We live in
a world of duality. So, that&#39;s just what
you expect. With the NDE space
exploding, people started jumping in to
find ways to monetize off of it. One of
the first things that happened is that
people would take my content and those
of other podcasts in the niche. They
would just record sections of our
interviews and paste them together into
their own collab and paste it as their
own content. There were some channels
that grew rapidly, like overnight to
like 300,000 subscribers before they got
caught and taken down by YouTube.
Another thing that&#39;s happened, of
course, is that now it&#39;s not as much of
a risk to come out with an NDE story, so
people fake it. It&#39;s a lot more likely
that somebody will make up a story that
didn&#39;t actually happen so that they can
sell a product or one-on-one sessions or
whatever it may be. I will say that I
still think the majority of people that
go on podcast to share this information
are legitimate because although NDEs are
more widely recognized, there&#39;s still a
risk with family and friends with being
looked at as weird or people think that
you&#39;re lying. That&#39;s there&#39;s still a
risk in people&#39;s personal life, but I
don&#39;t doubt that it does happen. There
was a lot of uh competition that was
introduced into the podcasting NDE space
starting probably in about the year 20
end of 2022 beginning of 2023. You
started to see companies or podcasters
with big teams jumping in and
skyrocketing their channels overnight.
you see started to see a lot more
variety and creativity and competition
in the field which again comes with its
positives and negatives but it&#39;s just
part of the process right eventually
probably I would say maybe h these are
just ballpark estimates but in the year
2024 we started to see a lot more AI
being used in content which isn&#39;t
necessarily a bad thing but one
complaint that a lot of people had was
the AI that was being used on thumbnails
s podcasters using clickbait titles and
thumbnails because there&#39;s all this
competition now and people who were
doing well before just sharing authentic
stories are now starting to struggle to
keep up with all these big channels that
are jumping in that have connections and
resources and big teams and a lot of
money to dump into the project. So, if
you hear noise, by the way, it&#39;s my
cats. My cats are always in here when
I&#39;m filming and they like to attack my
lights and chew on my cords and climb in
my closet and do everything that makes
the most noise possible while I&#39;m
filming. Anyway, these are all shifts
that I&#39;ve seen. Not positives or
negatives, just shifts. But now we are
on the precipice of the next shift that
is happening in the podcasting NDE space
or maybe just the NDE space in general
and that is the rise of AI generated
content. Stories that are fake from
start to finish. The story is fake. The
person telling the story is fake and
people are falling for it. And so what
I&#39;m going to do today is I&#39;m going to
show you what a couple of these channels
look like, what their content looks
like, and how you can avoid being
hoodwinkedked by these channels, which I
don&#39;t, not to sound condescending
towards people, a lot of people are
falling for this. There&#39;s thousands of
views, hundreds of comments on these
videos, and people believe that they&#39;re
real. And there&#39;s a couple of reasons
why I think that&#39;s just not an ideal
situation for people to be believing
that this content is real. And it is the
first shift that I&#39;ve seen in the
industry where it&#39;s like, okay, this
this isn&#39;t cool. Like before it&#39;s
friendly competition is the realities of
what&#39;s going to happen when a niche
expands. But this is kind of crossing
the line and I think it needs to be
called out and I think people need to be
made aware. What I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m
going to show you two examples of
completely fake AI generated NDE YouTube
channels. We&#39;re going to look at some of
their videos and I&#39;m going to point out
the ways that you can tell it is fake
and the reasons why it&#39;s problematic.
This is the first fake NDE channel that
I&#39;m going to share with you. It&#39;s called
Hidden Bible Secrets. You can see that
it has 10.4K subscribers right now. It
is quickly growing because not long ago
it had 500 subscribers. Now, if we look
through the content here, we can see
that it&#39;s all coming from more of a
Christian lens, fear-based Christian
style content, which is the first red
flag. Now, no offense to Christians.
There are Christians who have had NDEs
who I&#39;ve had on my channel, but the vast
majority of NDEEs are not
Christianbased, if you know what I mean.
Like Jesus may show up and give a
message or a Christian may die and have
a hellish experience and then be rescued
by Jesus, but the vast majority of NDEs
are coming from a non-religious
perspective. People from various
religions have NDEs. I&#39;ve had a Buddhist
on my channel. There&#39;s a well-known
NDER, Renee Pazarro, who is from the
Bahigh faith. Um, you&#39;ll talk to
Mormons, Jews, Hindus,
uh, pretty much any religion you can
think of. People have had the NDE, but
usually the NDE kind of shifts their
perspective and has them coming back
with a more open-minded viewpoint.
That&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t
people out there who have had very
Christian-based NDEs. And you can find
those on channels such as Randy K&#39;s. Uh
I still have my suspicions about
channels like those. Like why do you
have NDE channels that are only
interviewing and promoting NDEs that
come from a Christian worldview when
it&#39;s a very small percentage of the
range of NDEs that are out there. Having
said that, if you find a channel that is
all Christian-based NDEs, I mean, I died
and Jesus showed me why staying up late
weakens your spirit. I died and Jesus
reveals what happens spiritually when
couples live together. I died and Jesus
told me seven ways Christians waste
their salvation. I died and Jesus showed
me why millions are deceived by yoga and
meditation. I mean, this channel could
have been created by a Christian pastor.
You don&#39;t see this kind of stuff in real
NDE. I mean, this is anecdotal evidence,
but I&#39;ve read and listened to hundreds,
if not thousands. I&#39;ve interviewed so
many people at this point, and I&#39;ve
never heard like specific sins like this
being called out, like cohabiting before
marriage or staying up late. Um, if
anything is called out in the life
review, if any specific sins, so to
speak, or called out, it&#39;s always a lack
of love. It&#39;s always, uh, you could have
showed more love in this moment. Look
how this action of yours made this
person feel. So, that&#39;s the first red
flag. So, let&#39;s take a closer look.
Let&#39;s click on one of these. Try to find
one that has a few more views here.
Let&#39;s see. How about this one? I died
and Jesus revealed the four foods
Christians must avoid. I just want to
take a break for a quick moment to thank
you from the bottom of my heart for
watching and supporting this channel. I
could not put out this content without
your support. Just watching and
commenting and sharing the videos is
huge, but you guys ask me consistently
if there&#39;s anything else that you can do
to show your support financially. And
there is a way that you can support the
channel and also get huge benefit for
yourself. I have a community membership
called the sanctuary which you can join
for as little as $10 a month. I created
the sanctuary because people in the
spiritual community tend to be very
lonely. Oftentimes people have
deconstructed their faith. They&#39;ve had
an NDE or spiritual experience that
they&#39;re afraid to share with people. And
so many of us are looking for that safe
space where we can connect with others
like us, feel safe to share, and as an
added bonus, grow together. And that&#39;s
exactly what the sanctuary is designed
to be, a safe, supportive space. We have
a thriving community. We have courses,
many courses, challenges, meditation
soundtracks, and I&#39;m now starting to
create energy work infused meditation
soundtracks for you to join with me in
doing energy work and giving healing to
the planet, which is by far my favorite
type of content I have ever created in
my entire time as a content creator. So,
join the sanctuary today to get access
to all of my meditations, my new energy
work infused meditations, and all the
other wonderful resources and people
that you will meet in the sanctuary.
Link is in the description box. Thank
you for your support. Now, back to the
show. So, let&#39;s take a closer look.
Let&#39;s click on one of these. Try to find
one that has a few more views here.
Let&#39;s see. How about this one? I died
and Jesus revealed the four foods
Christians must avoid.
My name is Daniel and I grew up in a
Christian home where the Bible was read
every morning before school.
Okay, first obvious thing to point out
is, can you see how robotic this AI
voice sounds? And if you watch the man&#39;s
facial expressions, it&#39;s clear that
they&#39;re not natural. Also notice how
there was a small clip of his face and
it jumped right to B-roll. For those who
aren&#39;t familiar, B-roll is when a stock
video is put over top of the person
speaking. That in and of itself isn&#39;t a
dead giveaway, but let&#39;s look and see
what happens in the rest of the video.
My father was a quiet man of prayer, and
my mother carried a faith so steady that
it became the anchor of our family. I
was taught the stories of Noah, Moses,
and Jesus from the time I could barely
speak. But as I grew older and life
became complicated with
responsibilities, careers, and
ambitions, my devotion became more of a
Sunday tradition than a daily walk.
Okay, here&#39;s a couple key things to
notice. If it sounds like the person in
the video is reading off of a script, it
is most likely AI generated content.
Real people when they talk, there are
pauses, there are ums and a&#39;s, although
a lot of that is edited out by either a
really good editor or AI editing
technology like Descript, the program
that I use. Um, all pauses, ums, and a
can be edited out. However, the person
will still have emotion in their voice
and it won&#39;t sound like they&#39;re reading
off a script. The language isn&#39;t going
to be as fancy when it&#39;s a real person
speaking and there will be emotion in
the voice. So, two telltale signs of AI
content is like a flat reading and when
it sounds too formal. Another thing is
I&#39;m going to run my mouse along the
screen at the bottom of here. Do you see
anywhere that the man&#39;s face pops up
again? It&#39;s all B-roll. We see one short
clip of him at the beginning and then he
never shows his face again. The reason
why this is problematic is two things on
YouTube. Personal connection with
showing of eye contact and facial
expressions and emotions is incredibly
important. It&#39;s one of the main tools
that YouTubers use to get views and
interest in their videos. So, why are
they not showing the person&#39;s face? It&#39;s
YouTube 101 to give eye contact and show
facial emotion. The second important
point here is that B-roll takes a lot of
work. It takes hours to put B-roll on
videos. So, while a good editor will
make use of B-roll to keep the video
interesting, they&#39;re not going to cover
the entire video in B-roll. They&#39;re
going to flash back and forth to the
person talking. They&#39;re going to make
use of graphics and text and other
things as well. Here&#39;s a good example of
a channel that does use B-roll that is a
legitimate channel so that you can see
the difference. Okay, the Other Side NDE
52,000 subscribers and welldeserved.
This is a legitimate channel that has
put in the work, done the interviews,
created beautiful videos. And let&#39;s take
a look at one of their videos. How about
this uh most recent one here? I was
dragged to hell until this happened.
This enormous fear and terror came
across me.
So, right away, you can see the use of
B-roll. A lot of podcasters use B-roll
immediately when the video starts to
make it interesting to keep people
watching. Oh, please. And then the next
thing I knew I saw this little teeny
tiny light like a pinpoint of a light
and I started moving towards the light.
My name is Christine Harrington and I
want to preface now we can see the face
of the person speaking. Let&#39;s give it a
minute and see what we can gather here
first that I am a Catholic. I was born a
Catholic. And the reason why I want to
preface with that is because it ties in
with my near-death experience story. So,
we&#39;ve flashed to B-roll again. Let&#39;s see
how long this lasts before her face
shows again.
That I was born a Catholic. I moved away
from the church in the late &#39; 70s after
my divorce. And to say that I lived
pretty promiscuous life is somewhat
true. And I&#39;ll just say I wasn&#39;t living
life according to the Catholic Church.
So I found myself pregnant. And this was
in my early 30s and the father of the
child said get rid of it. And at the
time my parents were not supportive at
all. So, I went through my first
abortion. Then, after I left him, a few
years later, I found myself living with
a man and I was pregnant again and I had
a second abortion. I know. Here we are.
We&#39;re a minute and 34 seconds in and
we&#39;re seeing her face again. This is how
a legitimate channel will typically go
about using B-roll. Now, if we scroll
through here, we&#39;ve got uh more B-roll.
jumping back to her face at four minutes
and the video jumps back between B-roll
and her face. The reason why it&#39;s a dead
giveaway when you only see one small
portion of the person&#39;s face at the
beginning and then it never shows again
is because they have to AI generate that
person talking. And that&#39;s tricky to do
because AI is still learning how to get
the right facial expressions, the right
voice tone, all of these things. And so
they&#39;re going to use the AI fake person
for as little time as possible on the
screen. Will it stay that way for very
long with as fast as AI is improving? I
don&#39;t know. But that&#39;s where we&#39;re at
right now. Now, let&#39;s finish out. Maybe
let&#39;s jump a little farther along in
this video to see what these four foods
Christians must avoid. Like what is the
point they&#39;re trying to make with this
video? And then I&#39;m going to show you
some other things to look for when
determining if a channel is fake.
Jesus placed his hand on my shoulder.
His voice grew both gentle and fierce.
Tell them this. Return to what is whole,
in food and in faith. Eat what I created
in its fullness. Grains unrefined,
fruits unaltered, foods untouched by
greed. And spiritually consume my word,
not the traditions of men. In the last
days, the bread of idolatry will be the
snare of many. They will sit at tables
filled with abundance yet remain empty
inside because they fed on what was
lifeless. He then quoted the scripture
that struck like lightning in my soul.
Amos 8:11. The days are coming, declares
the sovereign Lord, when I will send a
famine through the land, not a famine of
food or a thirst for water, but a famine
of hearing the words of the Lord. I
realized this was the double-edged
message. Physical bread was being
corrupted and spiritual bread was being
counterfeited.
So, we can see that this is a really
Christian end times type video. Kind of
a fearbased message being given here,
which is pretty untypical for NDE
Both were starving God&#39;s people. The
loaf before me turned to ash and
scattered in the wind.
I&#39;ve never heard a real NDE account talk
about God&#39;s people. This is a dangerous
exclusive ideology that is promoted by
some religions, but NDE accounts see all
people as divine beings having a human
experience.
And the four foods were now revealed.
Blood contaminated meats, artificially
sweetened and chemically altered foods,
unclean meats, refined and idolatrous
Okay, so there might be some good
dietary advice here. What is idolatrous
bread? What is idolatrous bread? This is
really again fearcloaked religious
ideology that&#39;s being promoted.
Vision ceased, his eyes locked onto mine
with a weight that seemed to pierce my
soul. Daniel, you have seen. You must
tell them. These warnings are not
optional. They are lifelines. Those who
obey will walk in strength, clarity, and
holiness. Those who scoff will weaken,
and many will fall away when the testing
Again, more religious language. People
are going to fall away when the testing
comes. This is taken straight from
modernday end times Bible prophecy
thinking. This is not a type of thinking
I&#39;ve seen in near-death experiences
ever. Do NDEs talk about so-called end
times events? Yes. In the context of
this is what the collective choices of
humanity are leading towards. We could
be heading for some tumultuous times
ahead if humanity doesn&#39;t figure out how
to be loving and live in peace and
harmony in the world that the collective
consequences of our choices could be
something we don&#39;t want to experience.
But there&#39;s never this idea of the
select few who are following the right
path or some people are going to fall
away. There&#39;s none of this religious
language, this religious fear mongering
in it. Right? So, I think we get the
idea. I think this is probably enough of
this particular video. Now, I&#39;m going to
show you a few more things to look for
when vetting a channel. So, if you
scroll down beneath the video and look
at the description, there&#39;s a couple of
things to look for. The first is look
for more information on the guest. What
is the guest&#39;s name? And here you&#39;ll see
a lot of them do shared names, but here
we don&#39;t even have a name. I died and in
that moment I met Jesus. He revealed to
me four specific foods that Christians
must avoid in the last day. Uh won&#39;t
read the whole thing here, but there&#39;s
no name mentioned, so you can&#39;t even
look up the guest. Okay, let&#39;s look at
let&#39;s pick another video that maybe does
have a name so I can walk you through
this process. I died and Jesus revealed
the shocking truth about cremation. No,
pastor preaches. Do we have a name here?
There&#39;s There&#39;s no name. So, actually, I
might have to go to the other channel
that I was going to show you to point
out the problems with the description
box. Um, I mean, this one&#39;s really
obvious. If there is no information
about the guest, it&#39;s probably not a
real guest. But let&#39;s switch over to the
other channel that I was going to show
you. Here we are on the Second Life
YouTube channel. We have a lot more
fear-mongering from a Christian
perspective here. Teen dies in church
shooting and returns with a shocking
warning from Jesus. Navy pilot dies and
returns with a shocking warning about
China. So, we&#39;re getting politics
involved here. I died and Jesus revealed
the horrifying truth about American
churches. One of the uh interviews with
the most views here was actually about
Trump. Here it is. Secret Service agent
dies and Jesus reveals Trump&#39;s real
mission for America. Let&#39;s click on this
My name&#39;s Ethan Hayes. I&#39;m 48 years old.
on April 11th, 2024.
So, you can kind of see like you can
tell kind of tell just by looking at the
face that it&#39;s fake. It&#39;s not quite
right. You know what I mean? Like, it&#39;s
getting closer to how a human face would
behave, but it feels robotic in a way.
While working a security detail in DC,
my heart stopped for 22 minutes. I&#39;ve
spent my entire adult life in the Secret
So, we saw a short clip of his face,
which has very quickly been replaced by
B-roll. It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s who you
are. You see the world through a lens of
threats, angles, exit.
Okay, before we progress, I want to
point out the flatness of his voice. It
sounds like he is reading off a script.
It&#39;s crowds, faces. My mind was trained
to calculate risk in a fraction of a
second. I protected some of the most
powerful people on the planet. Spent my
entire adult life in the Secret Service.
It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s who you are.
It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s who you are. It&#39;s
such a flat monotone voice. Nobody talks
about their job in the Secret Service in
a flat monotone voice like that.
You see the world through a lens of
threats, angles, exits, crowds, faces.
My mind was trained to calculate risk in
a fra of a second. I protected some of
the most powerful people on the planet.
I was good at it. I was calm under
pressure. I was detached. You have to
be. My life was my job. My wife Lisa and
our daughter Katie. I&#39;d come home, kiss
them both, and try to switch off the
part of my brain that was always
scanning, always watching,
that was always scanning, always
watching. It sounds like he&#39;s reading
off a script. This is something that
somebody might say, but it&#39;s not going
to sound so formal. Let&#39;s look down
along the bottom and see if his face
ever shows back up. Nope. It&#39;s all
B-roll, all pictures of AI generated
pictures of Jesus for basically the
entire video. If you go on to watch this
video, what you&#39;ll find is that it is a
very political message about Trump being
God&#39;s chosen instrument. You know, I
mean, I&#39;ve never heard of an NDE being
used to promote political figures. The
only time I&#39;ve heard political figures
come up in NDE is when people are shown
visions of the future and how things may
play out. I did hear a legitimate NDE
speak once about how he was shown that
Donald Trump would be elected to office
before it ever happened. And this I
heard this interview long before Trump
ever ran for president. But that&#39;s the
most I&#39;ve ever heard in terms of
politics being brought up. Now, let&#39;s
look at the description box on this
video and I&#39;ll point out the things that
you can look for to see if it is a real
person being interviewed. The first
thing again is look for a name. Now,
this channel does give names. Ethan
Hayes is supposedly the person here. So,
copy and paste the name, go to YouTube,
and type in the person&#39;s name, NDE
interview. Let&#39;s see if anybody has
interviewed him. If he&#39;s coming up at
all, and a quick search reveals there is
no Ethan Hayes who has been interviewed
on YouTube for an NDE. We can put his
name into Google Ethan Hayes NDE. Of
course, this video here is uh is coming
up first. Doctor dies and proves heaven
is real. Medical evidence. Well, I mean,
this has got to be someone else because
this one is claiming to be a doctor. Dr.
Ethan Hayes, a respected cardiologist.
So, I I bet you anything this is another
AI channel that&#39;s reusing a name. And in
this video, he&#39;s a cardiologist. Yep, I
think we just found another uh AI
channel here. Miracle Messages. So Ethan
Hayes is not a real person who has been
interviewed by anybody. That in and of
itself does not mean that it&#39;s not
legitimate. Perhaps it&#39;s somebody that&#39;s
sharing their story for the first time.
But then is there any contact info? A
lot of times interviewers will put the
contact for their guest in the
description. Not all channels do that.
But there is one more telltale way to
know if a channel is real from the
description box. There are real channels
that narrate NDE stories for people
where the person never shows their face.
There is no contact info for them
because they want to remain anonymous.
But those legitimate NDE channels will
have a way in the description box for
people to submit their stories because
that&#39;s what they base their channel off
of and they need people&#39;s real life
stories to continue creating content.
There is no information about Ethan
Hayes here, but there is also no way to
contact the channel to be interviewed to
submit a story for narration, nothing.
And that is a dead giveaway. Okay, let&#39;s
look at this new channel we found for a
minute here. Nurse dies and Jesus shows
her which celebrities will die in 2025.
Okay, I mean, I&#39;m Lisa Marie Peterson.
This video, guys, it has you you would
think from the title. I mean, it&#39;s kind
of a red flag title. Why would Jesus be
concerned with showing people which
celebrities are going to die? That
information is completely irrelevant to
anybody&#39;s life purpose. But this video
has 206,000
views on it. And let&#39;s look at the
comments. I love you, Jesus. I felt his
love and light as I viewed this video.
Thank you. Jesus is more real than
anything we can imagine. I mean I mean,
how many comments are there? 495
comments. Most people are taking it as
truth. Jesus is real. He spoke to me in
this video. I believe in Jesus Christ.
Although this incredible story is hard
to believe in a way. So, someone&#39;s
picking up on something here. The
message is very important. Let&#39;s take a
quick look and see what this video is
about. I&#39;m 48 years old and this
February I died.
See this like speckling happening in the
video? I&#39;ve seen this several times in
this AI content
on a hospital floor for 22 minutes. I&#39;ve
been an oncology nurse for over 20 years
at a
Okay, so we see that this channel is
using some of the same exact B-roll that
the other channels were. I&#39;ve seen this
exact picture of Jesus before.
Busy hospital in Charlotte, North
Carolina. My life was normal,
predictable even. It was my husband
Mark, our teenage son Josh, and me.
Again with the flat video, my life was
normal, predictable, even like that&#39;s
how people write, not how they talk.
It&#39;s probably an AI generated script
made to sound like good writing, but
it&#39;s not natural to how people talk.
Let&#39;s jump ahead and see if we could see
what the point or the main message of
this video is. Is ticking for every
single person. Tell them to stop chasing
the wind. Tell them to stop worshiping
idols of flesh and blood who will one
day turn to bone. I understood it
wasn&#39;t. I have never in any NDE ever
heard Jesus tell people to stop
worshiping idols of flesh and blood who
will one day turn to bone. This is again
very religious language probably
constructed from biblical ideas about
the celebrities at all. It was about us.
It was about where we put our hope. A
where we put our hope again is a very
very Christian terminology but not
typically heard in legitimate NDE
Peace settled over me. a piece I had
never known. I was home. This was where
I belonged. The thought of going back to
the loud, painful, broken world was
unbearable. Please, I begged him. The
words catching in my throat. Please let
me stay. I don&#39;t want to go back. I&#39;m so
tired. Please, Lord, let me stay here
with you. He smiled, but it was a sad
smile. He knew my heart. My precious
child, your love for your family is a
beautiful thing. Mark and Josh still
need you. Your work is not finished. He
moved closer. There are other patients
you must care for. Not just their
bodies, but their souls. You have seen
the truth. Now you must be a beacon of
it in a dark place. So, there&#39;s
definitely some positive aspects to the
message being portrayed in this video.
It definitely doesn&#39;t sound like a
legitimate NDE to me. Um, let&#39;s look at
the description box. There is no name.
It just says a 48-year-old nurse from
North Carolina. No way to contact the
channel. No way to contact the guest. No
way to submit a story. Most definitely
an AI generated channel. Here&#39;s one more
thing I want to show you before I stop
sharing my screen. And this is how a
legitimately done narrated NDE channel
looks. We have this channel called
Heaven Aways with 218K subscribers. They
have been around for a while and they do
narrate people&#39;s stories so you won&#39;t
see the person speaking come up on the
screen. Here&#39;s an example of a video
NDE in a long time. This one is really
long clocking in at around 50 minutes.
So enjoy. As an infant and a toddler, I
was raised by my atheist.
Now you can see that this is an probably
an AI generated voice that sounds flat
and expressionless and robotic. And I
mean, who knows? Maybe they have
switched over. I I mean, I don&#39;t know.
There&#39;s no real way to tell, but this
channel, I believe, used to use real
human voices to read their content, if I
remember correctly. And maybe they&#39;ve
switched to AI voices now. Um, I&#39;d hope
to think that this content they&#39;re
putting out are real stories. But here&#39;s
what you can look for in the description
box. You&#39;ll see something like this. If
you would like for me to narrate your
personal NDE, feel free to email me and
then they&#39;ll give you the email address.
This is one thing that you can look for
is just to see is there a way to contact
the channel? Is there a way to submit
your story? Because if they&#39;re sharing
real stories from real people, then they
need a way for people to contact them to
keep their channel going. Okay, now I&#39;m
going to stop sharing my screen. And
there&#39;s a couple things that I want to
point out that I believe are problematic
about this type of content. The first
one is simply the fact that nowhere in
this video or the description is the AI
content disclosed. I&#39;m going to read you
a quote here about YouTube&#39;s disclosure
policies for AI generated content. You
must disclose AI generated content if it
is altered or synthetic and could
mislead viewers, including deep fakes,
making a real person appear to say or do
something they did not, altered real
world events, changing footage of a real
event or place, or synthetic realistic
scenes, which is what these AI generated
uh channels are creating. creating a
realistic looking scene that did not
actually happen as well as a realistic
looking person that does not exist.
These channels are out of compliance
with YouTube policy and if enough people
were to report them, they could get shut
down, which is something to think about.
That&#39;s up to you if you choose to report
these channels. I do want to say that
I&#39;ve watched a number of the videos.
Some of them are really like religious
and fearmongering. Some of them do have
positive messages. And Jesus&#39;s phrase,
if they&#39;re not against us, they are for
us, comes to mind. If somebody is
sharing a positive message that is going
to inspire people to be more loving and
more forgiving, I&#39;m all for that.
However, they need to disclose that
they&#39;re using AI generated content. It
is unethical to share these stories as
real NDE stories when they&#39;re not. And
so YouTube requires the AI content to be
disclosed in the description box.
There&#39;s actually a little check mark
that you have to check in the back end
of YouTube when you get ready to post
your video if you&#39;re using AI generated
content under any of the three headings
that we just established. These people
don&#39;t appear to be checking that box.
They also honestly should from an
ethical standpoint be putting it in the
video itself at the beginning letting
people know this is an AI generated
story and script and person right
there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with
using a fictional story to inspire
people. Fictional is a powerful medium
to use to get a message across and to
affect change but when you&#39;re dealing
with something like a near-death
experience it needs to be disclosed. My
two biggest issues with this type of
content are as follows. The first one is
people who are drawn to NDE content.
Typically, they have a fear of death.
They have lost a loved one. Some people
are just curious. But a lot of people
who come to my channel have lost loved
ones or they deal with a crippling fear
of death and they&#39;re looking for
knowledge about what happens in the
afterlife, what&#39;s happening to their
loved one, what they can expect when
they pass on. And I think it&#39;s very
unethical and irresponsible to be
sharing fake stories in this environment
of very real people who are hurting, who
think that they&#39;re watching a real
story. If you want to use a fictional
NDE account to spread a positive
message, that&#39;s fine. But be upfront
about the fact that it&#39;s fictional. I&#39;ve
been reading fictional books this week
as an enjoyable hobby, and there&#39;s
powerful messages and ways that I&#39;ve
grown as a person through reading this
fictional story. But you need to let
people know that it&#39;s fictional because
people are changing their belief systems
based on these NDE accounts. They&#39;re
getting ideas of what&#39;s happening to
their loved one on the other side. Some
of these NDE accounts are going to
mislead people into thinking that their
loved ones could be suffering in hell
when they&#39;re not. And that leads into
the other point, the other issue that I
have with these AI generated channels.
Now, now maybe there&#39;s some that are not
Christian, but all the ones that I&#39;ve
seen are from a fundamentalist Christian
perspective. And it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s
this backlash of the fundamentalist
Christian community trying to get a
foothold in the NDE space. I have no
problem with legitimate channels again
like Randy K who chooses to just
interview Christian NDEs because that&#39;s
his worldview. I personally wouldn&#39;t do
that. I don&#39;t think it is a truthful
representation of what&#39;s actually
happening on the other side, but that&#39;s
his choice. Everybody knows he&#39;s a
Christian channel. He&#39;s going to
interview Christian NDEs, but most of us
in the mainstream NDE community
understand that there are a small
handful of fundamentalist Christian
NDEs. Um, some of them, in my opinion,
are made up. Um, after watching and
listening to hundreds of these accounts
and talking to so many people, sometimes
I get the vibe that certain stories are
being made up to push an agenda. But we
know there&#39;s a handful of fundamentalist
Christian NDEs out there, they are
definitely in the vast minority. If we
have these AI channels that are creating
mass quantities of fundamentalist
Christian NDE accounts and putting them
out there and like you saw there&#39;s
hundreds of thousands of views on some
of these videos, people are taking them
seriously, it&#39;s really detracting from
the powerful simplicity of the NDE
message that it&#39;s all about love. It&#39;s
not about religion. And it&#39;s really sad
to see because the NDE community as a
whole has fought to get the message out
there to break away from fundamentalist
religion and get the message out there
that NDE stories as a whole do not
support fundamentalist religion. the
real live NDE experiencers who have done
the hard work of putting themselves out
there, sharing their story, facing
ridicule, losing family and friends over
sharing their story is disrespectful to
them for people to be creating fake
content that is undisclosed that is
pushing a fundamentalist religious
agenda. Having said that, I do not think
that the answer is to use our voice to
stand staunchly against something and in
doing so to create more division. I
definitely don&#39;t think that that is the
answer. Again, we live in a world of
duality. So the more that we feed into
what we stand against, the more power it
will grow. I think that what we need to
do in the NDE community is to just stand
strong in our love, our peace, stand in
the truth of the stories that we&#39;re
sharing and keep our focus there rather
than diverting energy towards
criticizing and stressing about what
other people are doing and things that
we can&#39;t control. And I also think that
this is a lesson that humanity has to
learn the hard way with the path that
we&#39;ve gone down of advanced technology
and AI. Anytime we share the truth or
the light or the goodness, the shadow
side of that will rear its head. And
that&#39;s what&#39;s happening now. I think
that putting out the information is
crucial, but let&#39;s not put our focus on
the negativity and pulling down other
people. Just be aware of what&#39;s
happening. Report the channel if you
feel called to do so. And keep your
consciousness and your energy centered
in truth, in love, in peace. What I&#39;m
calling for here is awareness,
discernment without getting emotionally
entrained in what&#39;s happening. If you
want to report these channels, I&#39;ll show
you how. So, you go to the main page of
the channel, you click more, click
report user, report user. Again, the
easiest way to do this is spam and
scams. Just they want you to pick which
videos are scams. Just click a bunch of
them. Click next. And then you can put
in some details here. This channel is
creating AI content and not marking it
as AI content. Submit. And if enough of
us do that, uh maybe some of these
channels will get shut down. But again,
the ultimate goal isn&#39;t to be against
these channels and to push back against
them and fight against them and get them
shut down. It&#39;s just to be aware. It&#39;s
to be aware. It&#39;s to not fall for it.
It&#39;s to intentionally support the
channels who have put in the work um and
the gets who are legitimate like the
real people who want to share their
stories. There are countless real NDE
channels out there um that deserve to
get a lot more views than these fake AI
channels are and and don&#39;t because it
takes a lot more work, more effort and
time to actually do the real work rather
than posting fake content. So, I mean, I
can give you some names of people that I
have so much admiration and respect for
that you would be better served
watching. Okay, here&#39;s a few channels
that I watch. Spiritual Warrior Journey
3,000 subscribers. Magic is Real by
Shannon Torrance. She has been doing
this for years and she deserves a lot
more subscribers. She&#39;s so passionate
about what she does. Guy Lawrence does
fantastic work. Wisdom from North. I
absolutely love Yanuka. I consider her a
friend. We&#39;ve spoken on multiple
occasions. She has been working on her
channel. I believe for 10 years or more.
I mean, she has put in the work and she
puts out some fantastic content. And of
course, Jeff and Mara from the Jeff Mara
podcast. Jeff was my first friend and
colleague in the NDE space. He does
NDEs, but he&#39;s also more in the
paranormal range and is so passionate
about his work. Has worked so hard. I
mean, back when I was doing my first
interview with him, which was probably
back in 2021, he was putting out an
interview per day, him and his wife. And
there&#39;s so many smaller ones. I mean,
there&#39;s a lot of smaller NDE channels
that only have like maybe a few thousand
subscribers that are putting in the work
right now and deserve to grow faster
than these fake AI content channels that
are just growing at the speed of light
because they can put out content so
fast. and it it&#39;s not even real content.
But anyway, thanks for coming to my TED
talk today. This was kind of fun. Let me
know in the comments if you like this
kind of content. I can definitely do
more reaction videos. Kind of like
switch things up a little bit. Be loved,
be happy, be at peace, and go live your
most extravagantly loving life. Thank
you so much for watching. If you would
like to support the channel, we have a
few fun ways that you can do that. I do
have a merch store linked in the
description. We&#39;ve put some of the
phrases on t-shirts that you guys
requested. I have affiliate links to my
favorite blue blockers, my favorite red
light panel, and a couple of other
companies that I work with. You can join
my membership, the sanctuary. You can
sign up for an energy healing. I also
offer a four session energy healing
package. You&#39;ll find all these links in
the description. Thank you so much for
watching. Thank you so much for your
support. Now go live your most
extravagantly loving life.
