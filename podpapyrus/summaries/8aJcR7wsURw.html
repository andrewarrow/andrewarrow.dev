In 2025, the conversation is all about
the promise and peril of artificial
intelligence. We debate its ethics. We
marvel at its power, and we quietly
worry about where it&#39;s all heading. But
what if I told you the most chillingly
accurate warning about a future war with
machines didn&#39;t come from a scientist, a
filmmaker, or even a tech billionaire?
What if I told you it came from a rock
band 30 years ago? because you guys
requested it. Today, we&#39;re going to talk
about the story of four musicians from
Los Angeles that stared into the chaos
of their own time and saw the future.
This is a story of Fear Facto&#39;s album De
Manufacturer. Before we get started, a
quick word from today&#39;s video sponsor.
Today&#39;s video is brought to you by
Private Internet Access. Ever feel like
browsing the internet is like shouting
your secrets in a crowded room? That&#39;s
because without protection, your
personal data is out in the open for
anyone. hackers, the government,
internet service providers to see. But
there&#39;s a simple way to shield your
digital life. Private internet access.
So, what is a VPN? A VPN is a virtual
private network. It&#39;s an app that hides
your IP address and encrypts your
internet connection. Think of it as
sending your messages through a secure
private tunnel, so only you and your
intended recipient can see them. With
private internet access, your data is
protected by worldclass encryption.
Whether you&#39;re at home, in a coffee
shop, or using public Wi-Fi at the
airport, hackers on the same network
won&#39;t be able to steal your passwords,
keystrokes, or photos. For someone like
me, I spend a lot of time at the coffee
shops writing my script and editing my
videos. And I&#39;m always using public
Wi-Fi. Since I started using private
internet access, I&#39;ve never worried
about my security or privacy again.
Private internet access keeps my
connection hidden, even on risky
networks. But that&#39;s not the only reason
to use a VPN. Do you want more
entertainment? Do you want to access
region lock content? Well, private
internet access is for you. Then stream
your favorite shows on Netflix, Amazon
Prime, Disney Plus, and more. No matter
where you are, I&#39;ve had a number of my
subscribers asking me to do a story on
the group Big Star. Now, Hulu has a
documentary on Big Star, but because I
live in Canada, I&#39;m region locked from
accessing it. But with private internet
access, I can now watch the documentary
and use it for research on my own video.
Plus, you can get access to sporting
events that typically have regional
blackouts. It&#39;s one of the few VPNs that
supports peer-to-peer file sharing. And
here&#39;s what really sets Private Internet
Access apart. It&#39;s the world&#39;s most
transparent VPN provider with over 30
million downloads. They never record or
store user data. Their no logs policy
has been proven in court, and it&#39;s been
verified by a third party audit. That&#39;s
real privacy that you can trust. Don&#39;t
just take my word for it. Private
Internet Access is rated excellent on
Trustpilot by over 8,500 users. Protect
your entire household or workspace, no
matter how many gadgets you have. Right
now, you can get Private Internet Access
for just $2.3 a month. That&#39;s 83% off

industrial bands that emerged in the 80s
began their careers making electronic or
alternative rock music before blending
their sound with metal. Fear Factory was
among the earliest extreme metal groups
to experiment with electronic elements
and sampling. In LA in 1989, a young
guitarist named Dino Kazarus and a
drummer named Raymond Herraro wanted a
new sound. They aimed for a fusion of
death metal&#39;s brutal high-speed
aggression and the cold mechanical pulse
of industrial music inspired by bands
like God Flesh and Ministry.
They recruited vocalist Burton Cell,
whose unique ability would become the
band&#39;s secret weapon. Kazarus recalled
meeting Belle for the first time,
telling John Weerhorn, &#34;I first heard
Burton singing in the shower in the late
80s. We both lived in an eight-bedroom
house in Hollywood that this guy rented
out to starving musicians. Bert&#39;s in
there singing some YouTube songs and I
thought, &#34;Hey, it sounds pretty good.&#34;
Later, we met and started talking, and I
found out he was into some heavy, heavy
industrial. I was into grind core, death
metal, and speed metal. So, he turned me
on to stuff I didn&#39;t know, and we
decided to start a band together. Belle
was living in the house at the time
because he was playing in another band,
an industrial noise outfit named
Hateface. The band ended up splitting.
So at that point, Gazarus told Belle to
come jam with him and their drummer.
Fear Factory started out in 1989 under
the name Ulceration. Kazarus was also
friends with Ross Robinson who was
starting out as a producer and also
wanted to start his own label. He even
invited the musicians to record at a
studio after hearing their demos. They
recorded 16 songs in the span of about a
week, but the contract Ross offered the
group would have given him ownership
over everything. So, the group&#39;s lawyer
advised them not to sign the deal. Ross
kept the Masters while the band retained
the rights to those songs, but they
couldn&#39;t use Ross&#39; versions. They ended
up sending a copy of those recordings to
Roadrunner Records, which led to their
signing. We were at this convention and
that&#39;s how I I seen Max and I played him
the demo and he wouldn&#39;t give it to me
but he had a hotel room and we were in
his hotel room when he was listening to
it and I had to wrestle him to get it
back. I literally jumped on him on his
bed, grabbed the Walkman and took it
from his hands and got it out of there
and put it in my pocket. He&#39;s like, &#34;I
want that. Give it. Give it.&#34; And I&#39;m
like, &#34;I can&#39;t. I&#39;ll make you a copy.
I&#39;ll come back and I&#39;ll make you, you
know, I&#39;ll make you a copy.&#34; But he&#39;s
like that day he told Monty, &#34;Oh, you
got to hear Fear Factory. The the rears
are killer. The vocals are amazing. You
got to listen.&#34; So Monty&#39;s like, &#34;Oh,
yeah, really?&#34; Okay. So Monty up and
that&#39;s how we got signed. Belle&#39;s vocal
style was quite unique. He didn&#39;t just
scream. He could shift from a guttural
demonic growl to a soaring melodic
almost angelic clean vocal. In an era of
one-dimensional metal singers, this was
quite different. People genuinely didn&#39;t
believe it was just one singer. Gazarus
told John Weerhorn, &#34;I&#39;ve heard a lot of
people say Bert ripped off Killsw switch
engaged singer Howard Jones&#39;s style.&#34;
I&#39;m like, &#34;Uh, well, that was Bert&#39;s
thing. He was doing that before Howard.&#34;
After settling on the name Fear Factory,
they unleashed their debut album in
1992, Soul of a New Machine. The album
brought a new and original approach to
extreme metal, blending elements from
death metal, grind core, and industrial
genres. It was raw, chaotic, and utterly
metal historians credit Fear Factories
being one of the first to extensively
mix melodic and growled vocals in the
same songs.
But while the album established their
core DNA, it was still, as Belle himself
described it, the band grinding their
teeth, trying to find their roots while
simultaneously growing them. They were
kids learning as they went. The machine
was being born, but it wasn&#39;t fully
formed yet. The real turning point came
a year later. Funny enough, the band
didn&#39;t have a proper bass player for
their first recording. According to
Gazarus, Andrew Shives came in after
their first record was done, but he did
tour with the band. He and Raymond
didn&#39;t get along, so after their first
record came out, they had to find
another bass player. Gazarus recalled,
&#34;A week or two later, Christian came in.
Our rehearsal room was in South Central
LA, a heavy gang area. Sometimes we&#39;d
open the door and hear pop pop and we
knew someone was getting shot at. So
we&#39;d close the door and wait till it was
over. During the LA riots, the owner of
the place put a sign that read
blackowned business on the door so the
building wouldn&#39;t be burned down. The
band returned in 1993 with a remix EP
Fear is the Mind Killer. It was a
crucial experiment. The band handed
their tracks over to Reese Fulber of the
legendary industrial act Frontline
Assembly who deconstructed and rebuilt
them, injecting a heavy dose of techno
as well as electronic texture. The band,
who were always fans of Ministry and
KMFDM, wanted to integrate more
industrial elements into their sounds.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This collaboration with Fulberg didn&#39;t
just get them played in industrial
clubs, it opened a sonic doorway for
them. It showed them the path forward.
All the pieces were now on the board.
The cinematic scope, the industrial
chill, the rhythmic precision, and the
dual vocal attack. All they needed now
was a story to tell. And in the early
&#39;90s, the world around them in Los
Angeles was providing one. While sci-fi
films like The Terminator and Bladeunner
were obvious inspirations, the true fuel
for their follow-up release
demanufacture
would come from the streets of Los
Angeles. Between 1990 and 1995, the city
felt like it was collapsing. There were
fires, floods, and a massive earthquake.
Most famously, the 1992 riots following
the Rodney King verdict turned the city
into what felt like a war zone. Gazarus
recalled seeing the National Guard
patrolling the streets at night. Bell,
meanwhile, added, &#34;We were in a hostile
environment. LA was just a hot bed of
riots. There was so much racial tension.
Everyone was a target. No one trusted
the police. It was surreal. There were
guys on top of buildings with
semi-automatic rifles protecting their
goods. We were living in demanufactured
times, fighting against the man and
struggling for survival. And these guys
did struggle for survival due to the
1994 earthquake in LA. Kazarus and Bell
were virtually homeless after their
apartment building was damaged. They
ended up slumbing it on friends couches.
And when they actually reached out to
FEMA for help, they got nowhere. This
experience played a part in influencing
what came next musically. Bel reflected
on their goal with their music at the
time, telling Karang, &#34;After Fear is the
Mind Killer, we wanted a combination of
that and Soul of a New Machine, not
totally electronic, but with some new
developments, and we also wanted to keep
the hardcore and metal vibe because we
toured with a lot of hardcore bands. I
also started expanding my vocals to add
a little bit of more to it. The band did
run into some more roadblocks, though.
The studios they chose to record
presented their own set of challenges.
Fear Factory started recording de
manufacturer at well-known Chicago track
studio picked largely because of
industrial heavyweights like Ministry
and Skinny Puppy having used it before.
Dino later remembered the place as being
in terrible shape having constant
computer crashes during drum tracking
and a chaotic atmosphere and even drug
dealing was happening on site which made
the band decide they had to get out of
there. They soon headed to Beersville
Studio up in New York&#39;s countryside. It
was a legendary place where giants like
Alice Cooper and the Rolling Stones cut
timeless records. Also on the premises
when Fear Factory was there was Faith No
More who they hung out with a lot and
Bon Joy was there as well. The band once
again hooked up with acclaimed British
metal producer Colin Richardson
returning after shaping the band&#39;s
debut. But the band hit another snag.
Richardson hated Kazarus&#39;s guitar tone
with the producer telling him to change
his gear. Kazarus was reluctant. This
led to an argument that lasted for weeks
before even one note was recorded for
the new album. With the budget being
used up by studio time and the clock
ticking, Kazarus wandered down to a
fruit stand that was just down the hill
from where they were recording and he
ran into Dr. No from Bad Brains. He told
him what was going on in the studio and
Dr. No offered his gear for Gazaaris
with him telling Louder Sound, &#34;The
moment I plugged in, boom, the tone was
perfect. Everyone was wiping the sweat
off their foreheads.&#34; And this is what
led to the band ultimately deciding that
Richardson was not the guy they wanted
to mix the record. Kazarus had felt that
the band had outgrown Richardson&#39;s
approach, which would have likely made
the album sound like any other metal
record. The initial mix buried the
keyboard, so they took control and
worked with Reese instead, and Greg
Reley, whose first mix nailed the sound
that they were looking for. Belle
remembered mixing at Enterprise Studio
in Burbank, surrounded by massive
screenplay films like Bladeunner and
Terminator or video games which fueled
their inspiration and creativity. Fear
Facto&#39;s influential demanufacturer hit
shelves on January 13th, 1995, featuring
a striking and boundary pushing cover
art that was done by renowned graphic
artist Dave McKeen. Known for his rich
multi-layered visual style that blends
collage, photography, painting, and
digital effects, McKeen crafted imagery
for demanufacturer that fused industrial
and biomechanical elements perfectly
reflecting the album&#39;s futuristic themes
of technology, machinery, and human
alienation. The right side is made up of
ribs and spinal cord, and a barcode is
found on the other side. This wasn&#39;t an
abstract concept. It was their lived
reality. The first line you hear on the
album is desensitized by the values of
life. That was what they saw every day.
This constant state of urban decay, of
societal systems breaking down, which
became the backdrop for the album&#39;s
narrative.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was the perfect real world dystopia
to channel into their art. They took the
chaos that they were living through and
asked a pretty simple question. What
happens when this chaos is organized,
controlled, and weaponized by
technology?
The sound didn&#39;t just update the rules
of industrial metal, it rewired them
completely. The album has a loose
concept thread telling the story of an
individual struggle against a
machine-controlled totalitarian
government. Each song feels like a
chapter in the struggle. The very title
demanufacture suggests an act of
defiance to break something down to its
essential parts to unmake the system.
Kazarus told the record newspaper, &#34;It&#39;s
the soundtrack of a person struggling to
exist as an individual, where
individuality is taboo. Songs like
Replica directly echo the themes of
Bladeunner, questioning what it means to
be human in a world of artificial
Self-bias resistor is widely interpreted
as a song about resisting conformity and
oppressive systems, especially those
trying to control or dehumanize people.
Zero Signal, meanwhile, spoke to the
disaffected with its lyrics about losing
faith in a world controlled by
technology.
Its inclusion on the Mortal Kombat movie
soundtrack broadened the band&#39;s audience
significantly, cementing its place in
&#39;90s culture. But the album&#39;s genius is
the man versus machine concept, which
was a metaphor. It was about the
individual against the system, whether
the system was the government, religion,
or technology itself. Burton told Kang
that the album also contained some
deeply personal songs, adding the
Therapy for Pain was about a dream he
had about an ex-girlfriend and being in
love and in pain at the same time.
What&#39;s truly remarkable is how the
album&#39;s themes have become more, not
less relevant over time. 30 years ago,
the idea of technology controlling our
lives or artificial intelligence making
decisions for us was science fiction.
Today, it&#39;s our daily reality. The album
warned of a world where humanity becomes
obsolete, a theme they would explore
even further on their next album, aptly
titled obsolete. The lyrical content of
demanufacture feels eerily relevant. It
talks about desensitization, government
lies, and the loss of individuality in a
mechanized world. These are the
conversations dominating our headlines
right now. The album&#39;s narrative about a
man fighting a machine control
government no longer feels like a
distant fantasy, but an allegory for our
own anxieties about algorithmic control,
surveillance, and the dehumanizing
nature of modern life. The fusion of
human and machine wasn&#39;t just in the
lyrics. It was in the music itself. They
used technology to critique technology.
They created a sound that was
paradoxically both organic and
synthetic, a chromeplated hybrid of
flesh and steel. They played with such
mechanical precision that it sounded
artificial. Yet, it was driven by raw
human passion. Raymond Herrari&#39;s
drumming was so precise and fast that it
sparked debates among listeners about
whether it was a real person or a drum
machine. Bel told Karang he was a
machine himself. He would play with
combat boots and leg weights just to
build up stamina and strength. People
didn&#39;t believe he was a real drummer.
Dino Kazarus&#39;s guitar riffs are brutal
and perfectly synchronized with the kick
drums, creating a percussive machine gun
assault. Over this Reese Fulber&#39;s
keyboards and samples add a layer of
cold cinematic atmosphere. And at the
center of the storm is Burton Sey Bell&#39;s
switching effortlessly between the voice
of the oppressor and the voice of the
resistance. As vocalist Burton Cy Bell
later reflected, &#34;What we did was raw
and real and instinctive. That raw
energy wasn&#39;t for the mainstream.
Demanufacture is still dangerous.&#34; Upon
its release, Demanufacture was met with
ecstatic reviews. It became a commercial
success, earning a gold record in
Australia and a silver record in the UK.
A major achievement for a band so
extreme. Meanwhile, in the US, the album
peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Top
Heatseekers chart. More importantly, its
influence was immediate and undeniable.
It&#39;s often cited as creating a template
that countless bands would follow,
shaping the sound of industrial metal,
new metal, and metal core for years to
come. Many regard it not only as Fear
Facto&#39;s best album, but one of the
greatest and most iconic metal albums of
all time. It stands as a landmark in
metal history. Even today, Dino Kazarus
says he goes back and listens to the
album&#39;s structures when he&#39;s writing new
music. A testament to its groundbreaking
composition. But its true legacy isn&#39;t
just the sound. It&#39;s its foresight. The
album was so ahead of its time that it
still sounds like the future. The themes
of technological alienation of the
struggle to maintain one&#39;s humanity
against an encroaching all powerful
system resonate more deeply now than
they ever did in 1995. Fear Factory
didn&#39;t just write a great metal record.
They authored a warning. They saw the
storm on the horizon and set it to
music. Fear Factory captured the moment
where humanity&#39;s relationship with
technology shifted from one of simple
tools to one of potential equals or
superiors. They chronicled the birth of
a new kind of fear. A fear not of
monsters or demons, but of our own
creations looking back at us. A fear
that one day we might be demanufactured
by the very world we&#39;ve built. What do
you guys think? Was demanufacture a
lucky guess or a true prophecy? Let me
know in the comments below and thanks
for watching and we&#39;ll see you again on
Rock True Story. sticker.
