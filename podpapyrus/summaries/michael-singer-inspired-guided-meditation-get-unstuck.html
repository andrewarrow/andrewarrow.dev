welcome to this guided
meditation this practice is designed to
help you release anything
stuck something you were bothered
by something that you didn&#39;t like that
happened something your mind cannot stop
trying to judge or fix or dislike
start by finding a quiet space and
closing your
eyes take a deep breath and notice your
body your
feet your
legs your
chest your shoulders
arms your
hands your
neck your
head take a breath and bring your
awareness to your chest as it rises and
Falls slowly take a deep breath in and
hold now slowly
release once more on your
own now bring the event that&#39;s stuck
into your
awareness did this happen at
work at home in a conversation between
someone something bothered you that
happened while you were going about your
day instead of asking yourself what
should I do about
this ask
yourself what part of me is disturbed by
this honor and respect the situation
openness bring this event into your
awareness once more like a screenshot or
a video of an
event replay it in your head and notice
any feelings in your body and notice
where they
arise now take a breath and
relax lean away from
judgments lean away from your mind&#39;s
noise lean away from the seat of
self give room to let any negative
feelings about this situation pass
you every moment of life is a spiritual
experience a chance to let a situation
take place and just be there with
it lean away from your mind and sit into
the silence
you do not have to work out every issue
just tell yourself I&#39;m going to relax
I&#39;m going to let this situation take
place and be there with
it let whatever is bothering you pass
through you if you feel your heart
beginning to close just say no I&#39;m not
going to
close lean away from your
mind into this silence your path forward
will be obvious
once more take a breath
in and
out now bring your awareness to the
center of your body feel the Miracle of
Life inside of you
all of time billions of years and
trillions of small individual moments
have brought you here to this moment
now sit with gratitude in this
take a conscious
breath now open your
eyes bring your awareness to the world
you take one more deep slow breath
now go in peace and do not let your
heart close
