<li>Life causes trouble physically, emotionally, and mentally - this teaches us everything about evolution</li>
<li>Consciousness is universal and the same in all beings - from amoebas to enlightened masters - but gets distracted by what it focuses on</li>
<li>Spiritual evolution occurs when consciousness becomes less distracted by objects of consciousness (thoughts, emotions, physical sensations)</li>
<li>You are already enlightened - the entire universe's worth of divine consciousness exists within you, but you're distracted by smaller things</li>
<li>The biggest spiritual concepts are distraction and identification - when distracted by something long enough, you identify with it</li>
<li>Humans have evolved bodies, minds, and emotions that allow consciousness to experience a broader universe than lower life forms</li>
<li>You store unhandled experiences as either "things I like" or "things I don't like," which then run your entire life based on past patterns</li>
<li>Your ego/self-concept is just thoughts you've held together based on past experiences - it's not who you really are</li>
<li>In the cosmic scale, your problems are insignificantly small - you're one of 8.3 billion people on a tiny planet in a vast universe</li>
<li>The key spiritual practice is learning to let go and not resist experiences - this prevents storing emotional baggage inside</li>
<li>Evolution means being able to handle things when they happen, then letting them be over instead of carrying them forward</li>

<li>Real spirituality is learning to not be bothered by meaningless things through relaxation and releasing resistance</li>

<li>Instead of living from past programming, you can interact with reality as it unfolds moment by moment with clarity and openness</li>
<li>True freedom comes from being able to say "I can handle anything" - not through resistance but by letting experiences pass through</li>
<li>When consciousness stops looking at the small self, it naturally sees the wholeness and reality of existence</li>

Gative J masters
life has a way
of causing trouble if you haven&#39;t
noticed. The trouble can be physically
with the body, can be emotionally,
things going on with the heart, and it
can be mentally, the mind, negativity,
complaints, worries, anxiety, regrets.
And it can be all three at the same
time. If you haven&#39;t noticed,
if you&#39;re clear enough,
that teaches you everything about
evolution.
Everything.
The lowest level of evolution is an
lowle amphibians, etc.
They have bodies. Especially an amoeba
has a body. It excretes, it eats,
divides, and that&#39;s its entire life.
I once had an experience I won&#39;t get
into in detail where I met with very
very brilliant
genetic scientists.
They invited me to see what they&#39;re into
and so on.
And they made a statement which my god
has it shocked me. It was during the
time when they weren&#39;t allowing stem
cell research
because of religious values. The
government wasn&#39;t. There was a time like
that. And I was talking to them and of
course they didn&#39;t like those policies
because they were doing research. And
one of them said to me, I don&#39;t
understand what the problem is. It&#39;s
just chemicals. That&#39;s all that&#39;s there.
And maybe it&#39;s just chemicals.
Yes, the chemicals make up the body. The
chemicals don&#39;t make it want to eat. The
chemicals don&#39;t make it get away from
fear. If you start poking at it, it
doesn&#39;t like that. There&#39;s somebody in
there. Not much, but there is an
intelligence in there and it carries out
the processes that life carries out. It
has birth, it has death, it has
procreation different than people do,
but it divides in mitosis, etc.
and it eats and it secretes. It does
these functions.
Why does it do these functions? Why
would a chemical care about dying? Why
would it try to live? So
the problem, if you will, with our
society, our science, not all of it, our
science. And they admit it. It&#39;s
physical science.
You&#39;re dealing with the physical plane.
Well, on the physical plane, what you
see is chemicals. They can break that
down and tell all the chemicals it&#39;s
made of and see the chemicals interact
with each other and so on. It doesn&#39;t
explain why they do it. Don&#39;t explain
why there&#39;s a motive to live. The lowest
animals have a survival instinct. They
try to live. So you have this beginning
understanding that what the dance of
creation is is form, matter, physical
form, but somebody&#39;s living in there. I
say somebody, you call it whatever you
want. There is awareness of being. If
you poke a pin at an amoeba, it moves
away from it. It does not let you poke
it. It attempts to get away from it. It
doesn&#39;t want to have that experience.
That&#39;s because there is consciousness in
there. And I&#39;m going to go all the way
with you guys. How much consciousness?
How about I tell you the entire
universe&#39;s worth of divine enlightened
consciousness is what is inside that
amoeba. The same consciousness inside of
you, same conscious inside of an
enlightened master, the same conscious
inside of Christ. There&#39;s only one
consciousness. And all consciousness is
exactly the same. Like water is the
same. It can be in the form of steam,
can be in the form of ice, can be in the
form of liquid. It&#39;s the same. It&#39;s H2O
molecules vibrating at different rates.
Is an amoeba as conscious as you are?
No, of course not. The consciousness is.
So what&#39;s happening?
These are the basic fundamentals of
spiritual understanding. The most
important thing. Forget all your
practices, all your philosophies, all
your teachings.
Consciousness
gets distracted by what it&#39;s conscious
of. You know that you get distracted by
your thoughts. You get distracted by
your emotions. You&#39;re distracted by your
body. Okay? That is the same
consciousness that&#39;s distracted by your
emotions. How about positive emotions?
Same negative emotions. The emotion is
different. But the consciousness that&#39;s
distracted by it, pulled down into it so
that it focuses on it is the same. Well,
in an amoeba, it doesn&#39;t have thoughts
and emotions and much of a body, one
cell. That&#39;s not much of a body. You
have 35 trillion of them. The media has
one. Amazing. But it&#39;s still conscious.
So, its consciousness is limited to
being distracted by this body, by
whatever&#39;s happening in that cell.
That&#39;s its world. It doesn&#39;t know
another world. It doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re
there. It doesn&#39;t know there&#39;s planets.
It doesn&#39;t know anything. It only knows
the immediate interaction with what is
stimulating and attracting and
distracting its consciousness. So even
though the consciousness here here&#39;s
Einstein&#39;s consciousness I mean mind
it&#39;s brilliant brilliant right all right
but he&#39;s staring at a pin and he never
takes his mind off the pin how smart is
he nothing cuz he&#39;s not using the rest
of what he&#39;s capable of being conscious
of an amoeba only has what is coming
back from the sensations of the body of
that cell single cell so it is
completely distracted and focusing on
the functions of that cell. Therefore,
its world is the size of a cell. Okay,
that is its universe. Is it the
universe? No, it&#39;s not the universe.
There&#39;s an entire universe everywhere,
galaxies, planet, just the same for the
me as anybody else. But if it&#39;s not
paying attention to it, if it&#39;s focused
on the limitations of that one cell,
then you must understand that is its
universe. I talked to you about amiebas
so much today because I want to go from
amoeba to you.
Okay, go the next step up in evolution.
I&#39;ll be Darwin. Go the next steps up in
evolution and be a fish. Is a fish
limited to a universe of one cell? No.
A fish has eyes. A fish has has the
ability to experience much more of the
universe. The fish lays eggs and the
fish has schools and they hang out
together. All kinds of things go on with
fish. That&#39;s way more than what goes on
with an amoeba. Why is the consciousness
in the end? You&#39;re not going to like
this. In the end, is the consciousness
of a fish, the consciousness any
different than the universal
consciousness? There&#39;s only one
consciousness. It&#39;s all the same. It&#39;s
not fish consciousness. It&#39;s
consciousness just like there&#39;s water.
Like I said, it&#39;s an essence. There&#39;s a
thing called consciousness. It&#39;s an
essence in the universe that is aware
that it&#39;s aware that it&#39;s aware. is the
only thing in the universe that&#39;s aware
of itself. A house doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s
there. A fish&#39;s body doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s
there. But consciousness drops down into
it. That&#39;s what happens. Life
consciousness comes down into it. And
because the fish&#39;s body is more
sophisticated than an amiebas, it&#39;s able
to experience a larger universe. That&#39;s
all that&#39;s happening. And they can
explain any way they want. There are
deep truths here that you will come to
know for yourself. Consciousness is
always conscious. It&#39;s just a question
of what it&#39;s conscious of. And we just
went from limited consciousness to an
amieba&#39;s little cell to a fish that has
much more complex structures. So the
body of a fish, this consciousness that
is interacting with the body of a fish
is limited to its world which is way
bigger than an amiebas. That is
spiritual evolution. People write me and
say, &#34;I thought God was perfect. What do
you mean the soul evolves?&#34; God is
perfect. It&#39;s perfect. The conscious is
perfect. It knows the whole universe at
once. It is the whole universe at once.
Everything, every galaxy, every star,
every planet, every single thing in the
it&#39;s conscious of. That&#39;s what Christ
meant when he said, &#34;Not a bird falls on
the tree that God doesn&#39;t know. Not a
hair moves on your head.&#34; That&#39;s not
some psychic guy hanging out there. He
is the hair. He is the bird. He is the
ground. The consciousness created
everything. So that consciousness is
aware of everything at once. Well then
why amieba fish human because the body
start with the body the body that is
capable of being aware of and is
distracted by if you drop a hammer on
your toe guess where your consciousness
goes. If it hurts enough you&#39;ve been in
pain that pain is your whole
consciousness. It&#39;s your whole world. It
could be enough pain that that&#39;s all you
know about in your universe. There&#39;s no
more husband, no more wife, no more
children, no more food, no more
vacationing. There&#39;s just pain. Is that
true? Did the universe limit itself down
to your toe? No. You limited your focus
of your consciousness down to your toe.
The toe isn&#39;t any bigger than it was,
but it attracted distracted your
consciousness to focus on it. Now, that
is it. Okay? So, that&#39;s the evolution.
the fact that the bodies that the
consciousness is focusing on are more
capable of experiencing a bigger world,
the amoeba world, the fish world, and
then I&#39;ll skip the whole steps up. The
human world, a human body is the
pinnacle. Is it perfect? No, there&#39;s no
perfection. But what consciousness can
experience through that body is
incomprehensible.
It can move and maybe it can&#39;t do much.
A plant, go a plant, it&#39;s kind of rooted
in it. It can experience some things.
Venus fly trap tries to eat things,
right? Plants suck up through the roots.
And there are people that have studied
plants and said that they can feel
emotions and they can communicate. They
have auras. That&#39;s a whole another
level. That&#39;s not a physical body that&#39;s
starting to get into an energy body.
Fine. It just keeps evolving.
Consciousness does not evolve.
Consciousness gets distracted. Start
with just the body by what it is focused
on. And in these different stage of
evolution, it&#39;s focused on whatever its
physical evolvement is. So the human
being can eat vegetables, it can eat
meat, it can live in the tundra
freezing, it can live in the rainforest.
It has tremendous adaptability and
flexibility. Therefore, the
consciousness that is focused on your
body, what is distracted by is a bigger
universe than the amiebas or the fishes.
I&#39;m just teaching you something people
will not teach you which is you&#39;re
already enlightened. You&#39;re the highest
man walk the face of the earth. You are
so great it&#39;s incomprehensible. You&#39;re
the whole universe. But not if you focus
on something as small as your body which
is what you focus on. I just start with
the body. Your world is limited to what
you&#39;ve experienced. It is not. The
consciousness is everything but it is
distracted by what you&#39;ve experienced.
Therefore, your whole sense of being
starts with your body and what the body
is able to experience and see and hear
and touch and taste all your senses. So,
the conscious has now focused on
something smaller than what it&#39;s capable
of. You are capable of the highest thing
that ever was, ever will be in there.
You, the consciousness, is God is what&#39;s
really meant by God. The complete
creator of every single thing that ever
existed for the history of time and
space. That is who you are. Guess what?
Every master taught you that. Every
enlightened being from every tradition
said what Christ said what my father and
I are one. Tatwamas see thou art that.
That&#39;s who you are. But that&#39;s not what
you experience. Why? Because you are
getting distracted by your body and all
of its inputs and all of its different
feelings and drives and all that kind of
stuff. And then what happens? Because
you&#39;re distracted by it. I taught you
the biggest spiritual words. They don&#39;t
sound spiritual are distraction and
identification. If you are distracted by
something long enough, you identify with
it. You identify with your car. You say
it&#39;s my car. The my is a possessive
pronoun. And if somebody touches your
car, it&#39;s different than somebody
touches somebody else&#39;s car. Of course,
it&#39;s not. They&#39;re both pieces of metal.
You didn&#39;t build them. You put some
paper down. Now we say it&#39;s yours.
That&#39;s hilarious. So what&#39;s happening is
you&#39;re focusing on it so much that
you&#39;re identifying with it. So the
consciousness is distracted by the body
with all its input and then what happens
is always it&#39;s danger. The deer run
away, the animals run away. They feel in
danger. They feel challenged. This
danger now because you become more broad
in your experience. You build a higher
vibration called thinking and emotions.
So that you now have the ability to
worry about danger instead of experience
You built another level of your being.
You pulled it together. You have a
physical body. Now you have a mental
body and an emotional body and you are
distracted. The same consciousness is
distracted by each one of those. In a
sense in the 60s there was a whole
movement and you know it&#39;s very
spiritual 60s all that stuff. There was
a whole movement that you should tune
back into your body. You&#39;re an animal.
You should be an animal. That was seen
as spiritual. Why is that spiritual?
Well, of course it&#39;s not. But in any
event, because you got out of your mind,
they teach to focus on your breathing.
Why is focusing on your breathing
spiritual? Because you&#39;re not focusing
on your thoughts. You&#39;re not focusing on
your emotions. Why is meditating on a
candle spiritual? Because you&#39;re not
meditating on your thoughts. You&#39;re
getting out of your consciousness is
escaping from the trap of being
completely focused on your physical
body, emotional body, and mental body.
And I&#39;ve skipped the lore animals. They
they went through their own evolutions.
I don&#39;t know how much thinking ape does,
but it&#39;s not as much as yours. Oh, look.
The monkey can drive a car. You could do
a lot more than that. So, you&#39;re more
you&#39;re it&#39;s so funny. I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to
touch deep. You&#39;re not more evolved.
Your body and your mind and your
emotional bodies as we call them bodies
are more evolved. Therefore, your
consciousness is able to experience a
broader universe. You can think about
galaxies. I don&#39;t think a monkey can. I
don&#39;t know but probably not. You have
the ability of abstract thought. These
are just a very evolved mental and
emotional bodies. Your consciousness now
is filling the bottle of what the bodies
are capable of doing. But it&#39;s it&#39;s not
expanding your consciousness. It&#39;s
limiting your consciousness because it&#39;s
already fully expanded. But it&#39;s
focusing on what you&#39;re looking at. So
this thing called consciousness and
object of consciousness. Your
consciousness has an object. What it&#39;s
staring at. You go to sleep. You have
dreams. What are they? An object of
consciousness. You do experience them,
don&#39;t you? You go to deep sleep. And you
wake up in the morning. You say, &#34;Oh my
god, I slept so deep. I didn&#39;t have any
dreams.&#34; How do you know you didn&#39;t have
dreams? Cuz you were there, weren&#39;t you?
The same consciousness that&#39;s here
experiencing the outside world through
your senses was experiencing the world
your mind is creating mental body in
your dreams and you wake up you had
those experience in Panji&#39;s yoga sutras
one of the highest yoga scriptures ever
written he says that even in deep deep
sleep it&#39;s not that you&#39;re not conscious
you&#39;re conscious of nothing so your
awareness has no object of consciousness
therefore there&#39;s is a state of
liberation, as a state of freedom. You
can also call that the semi
superconscious state. When you go that
deep to where you&#39;re not being
distracted by anything, it&#39;s very
peaceful, total rest because the
consciousness is not being distracted,
pulled down by any object of
consciousness. So we have consciousness
and object of consciousness. The
consciousness is not expanding.
The object of consciousness is
expanding. Therefore, the consciousness
is not contracting as much. How&#39;s that?
That&#39;s what&#39;s going on. So, spiritual
evolution is the ability for
consciousness to not get distracted by
the object of consciousness. And
therefore, you meditate and that&#39;s where
all the stuff comes from. What about
mantras? Saying a mantra over and over
again is very different than letting
your thoughts drive you crazy.
All the techniques are the same. They&#39;re
all about you&#39;re distracted by your
thoughts. You&#39;re distracted by your
body. You&#39;re distracted by your drives.
You&#39;re distracted by every single thing,
aren&#39;t you? every single minute of every
single day. Okay? Do practices that
train your distractions
to be less. Limit the distractions that
are pulling your conscious down to them.
How&#39;s that? That spiritual practices do.
Okay. So, I&#39;m not telling you not to do
practices because you have to, but you
only have to because you&#39;re getting
distracted by things that pull your
consciousness down into your thoughts or
down into your emotions or down into
your body as opposed to your ability to
let go of the object of consciousness.
And you&#39;ll feel yourself being drawn
back into the infinite.
Not all at once, but you your world
becomes broader inside because you&#39;re
not being distracted by the outside. And
ultimately, that&#39;s where the masters
went. When it stopped being distracted
outside and emotions and thoughts, the
self, the consciousness self is not
being pulled out of its state of pure
awareness. And that is what
enlightenment. That&#39;s where masters drop
back into the state of union with the
whole universe. I told you that&#39;s who
you are. But you&#39;re distracted away from
it. And I hope you understand because
this is the essence of all spirituality.
All right. So now we ended up with a
very evolved body, a very evolved mind.
Oh my god, it&#39;s so evolved. It could
talk about anything all the time and
never stop. Right or wrong? All right.
And very, very evolved emotions. And
don&#39;t you doubt it. Your heart emanates
emotions. Your mind emanates thoughts.
What do you mean very evolved emotions?
Have you ever felt fear? You ever felt
love? You ever felt anger? Ever felt
embarrassment? Ever felt self-conscious?
Ever felt productive and proud? These
are feelings. The entire spectrum of
feelings, aren&#39;t they? You&#39;re so
evolved. Excuse me. Your objects of
consciousness, and we can watch my words
here. Your objects of consciousness are
so evolved that allows your
consciousness to experience a broader
array. Ultimately, if your body is
capable and and what happened is your
mind became so brilliant, it took over
your body. Your body can&#39;t fly. Oh yeah,
it can. Not because your body, it didn&#39;t
do anything. Didn&#39;t sprout wings, but
your mind was able to create things that
let you fly, to let you go to the moon.
So just see, you have a very, very
evolved object of consciousness at your
disposal. you the in there the self at
your disposal. You can do all these
physical things, these emotional things
and these mental things and expand your
conscious phenomenally. Oh again, they
expand your objects of consciousness
phenomenally so that the consciousness
has a larger universe to live in. You
have a way larger universe than your
siblings, other humans a 100 years ago.
They had no idea that there was
computers. They had no idea there was
AI. I mean, look what your conscious and
you&#39;re totally comfortable with it. You
learn it in five minutes. You can do
stuff. Look at your universe. How much
has expanded
from an amoeba or from a fish or from
anything. You are brilliant. You&#39;re a
great being. The trouble is your
are capable. Your emotional body is
capable of total love. It&#39;s capable of
experiencing total total blissful love
pouring out at all times. But what if
something happens that the physical body
doesn&#39;t like? Masters have transcended
physical bodies. When Gandhi was shot,
most most you&#39;re too young to know what
happened to Gandhi. very great being and
he was giving a lecture in India and
some person that didn&#39;t like his
teachings pulled out a gun and shot him.
As he fell to the ground, he turned to
that man and pronounced from the death
of his being in forgiveness. How
conscious do you have to be to have
transcended your body to that level? So
we are capable of great things. All
right. Now, let&#39;s get down to that&#39;s the
potential.
If you can handle everything that
happens to you, you don&#39;t have to get
distracted by it. You deal with it when
it&#39;s happening, but then it&#39;s over. You
get sick. Okay, your body&#39;s sick. You
get distracted by it some, right? But
you don&#39;t come all the way down. Next
thing you know, you&#39;re not sick anymore.
It&#39;s over. But it&#39;s not over to you.
Why? Because you&#39;re afraid of getting
sick again. You blame this. You blame
that. You do stuff with your mind that
keeps you distracted when it doesn&#39;t
have to be anymore. Let&#39;s give a little
example. Do you ever think about your
past? Things that bothered you in the
past. Do you ever find that they come
back up that they disturb you now?
They&#39;ll never happen again. You&#39;re 5
years old. You&#39;re 8 years old. You&#39;re 10
years old. 20 years ago. Why are you
doing that? You&#39;re now being distracted
not by something that&#39;s happening, but
because you use your brilliant mind. It
It&#39;s brilliant. It has the ability to
haunt you for the rest of your life. You
had divorced 10 years ago. You don&#39;t
date anymore. I don&#39;t see anybody. I
don&#39;t like it. I hate men or women. You
can do that, can&#39;t you? Can you do that
with your mind? Is it distracting? Has
it has it governed your life and
determined what you&#39;re willing to do or
what you&#39;re willing to experience or not
experience? You did that. You held those
things inside your mind. So now they
distract you. That&#39;s why you&#39;re locked
in the cage of limited awareness. You
can get so lost in your mind that you
don&#39;t even experience the outside world.
That&#39;s what trauma is. The mind got so
scarred and so disturbed by something
that happened years ago that the vast
majority of your life is thinking about
that and how to avoid that and
complaining about it and so on. It is
possible that a child can get so
traumatized by seeing their parents in a
car accident, something like that, that
they never talk again for the rest of
their life. What is that about? There&#39;s
nothing it&#39;s over. But it&#39;s not over
inside of them because they couldn&#39;t
handle what happened. They couldn&#39;t
handle the level of emotional and mental
disturbance that got created due to that
event. So that now their consciousness
is limited to that to what they&#39;re
focused on and what they&#39;re focused on
is the trauma of the event. Okay. So
this is what&#39;s going on. Evolution means
that you are able to handle things. So
they are going on when they&#39;re going on
physically, emotionally, mentally and
then they&#39;re over. You didn&#39;t keep them.
You didn&#39;t store them inside. If you
want to bring it back, bring it back.
You have a memory. But not that you
stored all the emotions and all the
problems so that now it comes back by
itself, doesn&#39;t it? Next thing you know,
we&#39;re having nightmares. Next thing you
know, somebody says something, you get
all offended. What did you do? I asked
you a question. Does your past run much
of your life right now? You have no idea
how much you think you like some things,
don&#39;t like other things. It&#39;s all
because your past experiences. If you&#39;ve
never experienced anything, you neither
like it nor like it. So, you stored this
stuff in here. And so now the world is
hitting it and you&#39;re either running
toward it or away from it. You&#39;re not
running toward the world, away from the
world. You&#39;re running either toward this
stuff you stored inside because it felt
so good and you liked it or you&#39;re
running away from the stuff you stored
inside. The world is just going about
its business but it&#39;s hitting your
stuff. It&#39;s so much so that your entire
life is now lived from down there. What
you want, what you don&#39;t want, what you
like, what you don&#39;t like, who you like,
who you don&#39;t like. You get into a
relationship with somebody, you feel
love, you feel go she reminded of your
sister or this or that or she liked the
same that people sit there and say, &#34;Oh,
but she likes the same kind of books
that I like.&#34; And so that means nothing.
Believe me, it won&#39;t stay that way. Have
you noticed?
You&#39;re a very complex being in there.
Why? Because every experience you had
that you weren&#39;t able to handle, you
stored. Either you stored it as
something I like and I want to happen
again, or you store it something I
didn&#39;t like and I never want to happen
again. And so now if somebody shows up
and hits the bad one, you don&#39;t like
them. But if you hadn&#39;t had that
experience years ago, you would be
meeting the person like anybody else.
Your entire experience of the
consciousness is distracted by this
garbage you stored inside. So it&#39;s
distracted by your body, what
experiences you&#39;re having. It&#39;s
distracted by your emotions, both having
and had, and it&#39;s distracted by your
thought patterns. So that&#39;s called being
lost. And by the way, that is a fall
from the garden. What does it mean? You
are God consciousness. You are the
entire universe. Uhoh.
How come I don&#39;t experience that? How I
experience fear and anxiety and I&#39;m
scared this thing will happen again and
I don&#39;t want to see my ex-husband. Why
is that my universe? Because you&#39;re
distracted by the stuff you stored
inside your mind and your emotions. And
I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s the only reason
that you&#39;re not an enlightened master.
Because you are. But what good does it
be to be an enlightened master if the
master is sitting there staring at a
picture and doesn&#39;t ever take his
conscious off of it. Okay? And that&#39;s
what you&#39;re doing. So that is the state
of a human being. Lost now distracted
by what the conscious is looking at. And
now let&#39;s talk about how small you I
said the am
you all agree all little tiny little
thing pluting around doing nothing.
Right? Okay.
You live somewhere in the planet Earth.
How many people are on the planet Earth?
Uh 8.3 billion. No, not million.
Billion. So you&#39;re really special.
You&#39;re one of 8.3 billion of the things
hanging on the planet Earth. That&#39;s
pretty small like an is not so far away,
is it? Oh, by the way, how long you
going to stay here? How long are you
going to stay here being nothing? One of
8.3 billion. Well, you&#39;re really
special. One of 8.3 billion things on
the planet Earth, right? What? 50, 60,
70, 80? I&#39;ll give you 90, 100 years. How
long has Earth been here? 4.5 billion.
So now, what are you part of? Nothing.
It&#39;s so meaningless. But you don&#39;t think
it&#39;s meaningless, do you? Because you&#39;re
distracted by your thoughts about you,
by your emotions about you, which are
all built upon the experiences you have
had. And I say this to you and I know
you don&#39;t like it which are nothing. You
have not experienced anything compared
to what there is to experience. Every
moment of your life you&#39;re having
experience. How many are missing? What&#39;s
the ratio of how many you&#39;re having at
that moment versus how many are going on
everywhere that you&#39;re not experiencing?
There&#39;s no number small enough, is
there? That&#39;s what you have going inside
your mind and your emotions. You have
limited yourself to this tiny world. Why
is that different than amoeba? Right?
And by the way, that&#39;s just the planet
There are 1.3 million Earths inside the
sun. I had you down to nothing a moment
ago. Now, of that, nothing. 1.3 million
Earths inside the sun. And the sun is
one of 300 billion stars in one galaxy.
And there are two trillion galaxies. You
want to be important? Talk to me.
in the realm of things. What&#39;s going on?
You got lost
being really small. You&#39;re busy being
really small, aren&#39;t you? How many of
you have a world that cares what the
weather is? If it&#39;s 65 or 75, if it&#39;s
humid, kind affects you, doesn&#39;t it? You
care about it, don&#39;t you? Look what
you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re a great being. And
look what you&#39;ve done to yourself.
You&#39;ve limited this universal expanded
consciousness. How small are you staring
at? What? Answer me. I want to know. Are
you willing to once in your life look at
reality? It&#39;s pretty nothing what you&#39;re
looking at, isn&#39;t it? But it&#39;s
everything to you. Forget weather. Hey
Sally, how you doing? And Sally doesn&#39;t
turn around. How you doing?
You&#39;re freaked out all day. Next time
you see S, I want to talk to her. You&#39;ve
limited your consciousness, which is
very great. And again, I&#39;ll make this
serious. I don&#39;t care what you&#39;ve ever
done. Has nothing to do with it. Do take
karma, throw it out the window. Take all
that stuff, throw it away. You are an
enlightened great being. That is one.
That&#39;s just one with God. You are that
that consciousness is God consciousness.
Okay? However, if you did something that
hurt somebody three years ago and you
feel bad about it and you can&#39;t see the
person anymore and you don&#39;t know how to
interact with them or talk to them,
there&#39;s your karma. You held on to
something. Therefore, your consciousness
is limited to that. Therefore, that&#39;s
who you are. That&#39;s where you live. And
your whole world will be about that.
They say at the moment of enlightenment,
all karmic seeds are burned. Of course,
they are because you&#39;re holding on to
them. Understand that? Why do
I&#39;m I&#39;m going to be really honest. Tell
you the truth. When I was really, really
little, I probably peed in my bed.
Should I be embarrassed? When I was 2
years old, one year old. Of course not.
Why? It&#39;s a terrible thing to do. Why
don&#39;t I karmically bow by that, right?
Where&#39;s the karma? You grew out of it.
You don&#39;t need to learn anymore. You
learned how to hold yourself together.
You learned how to do stuff. When you&#39;re
in grade school, you did some stuff that
wasn&#39;t nice, right? And you grew up. You
get to grow up. When you&#39;re little, you
threw tantrums. You want I want and you
kind you learned it doesn&#39;t work so
good. You evolved. So, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s
fine. The trouble is you&#39;re busy
focusing on what you held in there. The
past is over. People don&#39;t like it if I
say forget karma, right? If not that if
you suppressed it so you don&#39;t have to
deal with it. I&#39;m not talking about
that. That&#39;s just a form of mental
layers. I&#39;m saying if literally you were
playing a piano piece when you&#39;re in
fifth grade and you made a mistake at
the recital and you got really
embarrassed and you kept it your entire
life. No more piano. No more no I can&#39;t
play instruments. No, I never was good
at that. All right. That&#39;s your karma.
Not the fact that you made the mistake
at the recital. That&#39;s why you have
recital to learn. You&#39;re allowed to
learn, right? So, you sit there and
play. Now, you play much better. Don&#39;t
you dare hold on to that. You should
feel proud. Say, &#34;Thank you. Thank you
for helping me learn.&#34; But you can&#39;t
because you&#39;re not willing to let go of
these things. That&#39;s what you hold on
to. If you are able to let it go, it is
not affecting your life. You have the
right to grow. If you were perfect, you
wouldn&#39;t be here.
Earth is a place of souls sent to
evolve, but you won&#39;t be willing to
evolve because you&#39;re embarrassed that
you made a mistake that you said
something wrong or whatever it is or you
got a zit on your face at the high
school prom. And so you you ruin
yourself because you hold these things
in your mind, you hold these things in
your heart, and you have this whole
concept what your body&#39;s supposed to
look like. And it&#39;s not supposed to age.
Come on, let&#39;s be serious. Is anybody
listening? Is your body going to age or
is it going to keep looking like it is
when you&#39;re handsome and beautiful at
20? Let&#39;s come back at 85 and you don&#39;t
like it. All right, you built this thing
called a self-concept. Let&#39;s just get
down to the bottom, didn&#39;t you?
Psychology tells you you did. You built
an ego. What is that? Something you did
with your mind. These are thoughts you
held together in your mind based on your
past experiences. I&#39;m the person who
likes this, the person doesn&#39;t like
that. and the present a terrible thing
happened to No, you&#39;re in there. You&#39;re
not your past experiences.
You held on to them. Then you built a
whole model of who you are and what you
like and what you want and what you
don&#39;t want. That&#39;s called the ego. I
love the psychology calls it your
self-concept. What is a concept?
Something you made up. Self-concept is
not who you are. It&#39;s what your mind
thinks you want to be. And you define
yourself. And then you get all weird if
people agree with you, don&#39;t agree with
you. It&#39;s very interesting, but it&#39;s
really not because all of it distracts
your consciousness. You&#39;re distracted by
your body. You&#39;re distracted by your
emotions. You&#39;re distracted by your
thoughts. And that&#39;s the normal state
when you step on the path. Spirituality
is that you step back. You don&#39;t
suppress. You don&#39;t deny.
You step back a step. Simon says, &#34;Take
a step back and notice what&#39;s going on
inside your mind and what&#39;s going on
inside your heart.&#34; You do notice, don&#39;t
you? But it&#39;s so powerful. The pull is
so powerful that it causes you to act
according to that. If you had a bad
divorce and then somebody said, &#34;Oh, I
saw Allen the other day.&#34; You get weird.
Where? I don&#39;t want to go there. All of
a sudden, these past experiences that
you couldn&#39;t handle are running your
life. If you do that, you don&#39;t cease to
be distracted by the stuff that already
happened. And next thing you know, your
whole life, where do you want to live?
Well, I don&#39;t want to live in in Georgia
because that&#39;s where Allan was from. You
do this all the time. I want to have the
experience I had before. I liked it
again. I don&#39;t have the experience I had
before. I didn&#39;t like it. There you just
defined your life based on your past
experiences. Your past experiences was
to teach you how to not get distracted
by things. here. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re
watching the Olympics. Some people are
very great at one area and you&#39;re on the
balance beam and you slip. You ever seen
them? They spend four years of their
life practicing this stuff day and
night. They don&#39;t budge. They just get
right back on that beam as if nothing h
what that takes real discipline. No, you
didn&#39;t allow the experience to determine
the next month, even the next moment of
your life.
That is called being able to not get
distracted by something that&#39;s happening
on a tiny planet. That&#39;s what I do. I
learned a long time ago. Anything that
happens that starts to disturb him, I
take him by the I don&#39;t yell at him. I
used to. I take him by the hand and we
take a little step on top of the planet.
But the planet&#39;s like my chair and he
sits on top of the planet and he looks
around absolute black dark empty space
which goes on everywhere for a long
time. and you notice the sun and you
notice that that&#39;s one of 300 billion
stars. What exactly is bothering you?
Who said what that insulted you? You
have the right to do this with your
mind. You start using your mind to
liberate you instead of bind you. It&#39;s
called neutralizing the thoughts.
Eventually,
you get to a point where you&#39;re married
or you&#39;re dating and it&#39;s wonderful. you
think you have a wonderful relationship
with this person and they had a really
bad day at work and when they came home
they weren&#39;t very nice. They weren&#39;t
they&#39;re a normal loving little sweet
person, right? Can you handle that? Can
you handle that event? It&#39;s a
meaningless meaningless event in the
course of every other thing that&#39;s going
on in the whole universe. How small is
that event? But you can&#39;t handle it.
You&#39;re distracted by it to where that&#39;s
all you think about for the next hour or
two hours and then eventually the next
day say why did you treat me like that?
Why would you say something like that? I
would never talk to you like that. What
are you doing? You couldn&#39;t handle the
experience. Could you? But they teach
you it&#39;s normal. That&#39;s what it means to
be human. Well, you&#39;re not human. You&#39;re
God descended. You&#39;re a very great
being. And I would beg you that when
event like that happens, will you please
put in perspective
in relation to everything else that went
on at that moment? How important is that
event? Because you&#39;re distracted by your
body, your thoughts, your emotions. That
is the most important event in the whole
universe, isn&#39;t it? But it&#39;s not really,
is it? Are you willing to work on
yourself to be able to let go of what
you&#39;re distracted by? That is spiritual
growth. That&#39;s the bottom line. Can you
cease to be distracted by these
meaningless things? And your ego is
meaningless. It&#39;s meaningless, but it&#39;s
not meaningless to you. Because if it
gets what it wants, you like it a lot.
If it gets what it doesn&#39;t want, you
don&#39;t like it a lot. So all of a sudden,
your ego with these concepts of how
things are supposed to be run your whole
life to the point where if I talk to you
like this, most people can&#39;t even
understand how you could ever be that.
They think that to be that detached from
your ego, you have to suppress it. But I
don&#39;t like when people talk to me like
that. My mother, you talk to me like
that. I I don&#39;t have to listen. Okay,
fine. You want to live like that? Live
like that. Well, what do I do? Make
believe I don&#39;t like it. Maybe I do like
it. No.
You learn to let go. You learn to you
start by neutralizing. I&#39;m telling you
that thing I taught you about how small
that moment was. Come on. How small was
that moment? That one person out of 8.3
billion on planet Earth said one word
that hit your past stuff. And if you
hadn&#39;t had that past stuff, it wouldn&#39;t
have bothered you. Look how little this
is. I don&#39;t want you to live like this.
What it means to liberate yourself is to
not be bothered by these meaningless
things. But what would I do then? You
would come down onto this planet every
moment of every day of your life. Things
would not bother you. You don&#39;t suppress
them. You don&#39;t grab them. They come and
they go. You&#39;re able to handle it. Well,
what if I had a problem when I was young
and and now somebody brought it back up
and I felt this funny emotion? Fine. You
felt a funny emotion. So what? You have
to do anything about it. It&#39;s fine. Here
it comes. It goes. It passes by. You
stop storing inside of you. Every time
you do that, you grew spiritually. Why?
Because you were able to handle the
object of conscious that took place. So
you don&#39;t have to come down and hang out
with it. And next thing you know, you&#39;re
not bothered by things. Say, I had a bad
day. It&#39;s okay. How would you like to be
in a relationship with someone like
that? You had a bad day. They&#39;re fine. I
had a bad day. It&#39;s okay. That&#39;s what
you call a spiritually evolved being
that can handle reality. That&#39;s all
that&#39;s happening is reality. The trouble
is reality is hitting your stuff and you
stored that stuff in there. So you start
practicing this thing I call letting go.
That is the bottom line of real
spirituality. What do you mean? Life
happened. I didn&#39;t make it happen. I did
not. I just didn&#39;t go about my business.
Life happened. It hit my stuff. What do
I do? Make believe I don&#39;t have stuff.
That&#39;s ridiculous. That&#39;s spiritual ego.
Don&#39;t even think about it. Push it away
so I have to feel it. No, it&#39;ll stay in
there if you push it away. Well, what do
I do? It doesn&#39;t feel good. Of course,
it doesn&#39;t. It hits something you stored
in there. Take food that made you sick
three years ago and every day tastes a
little bit. You remember how sick you
got? You&#39;re going to be sick every day.
You stored stuff that bothered you years
ago. It will bother you again when it
gets hit. Why? Because it was so
terrible. No, because you stored it. You
don&#39;t have to store it. Okay, fine. It
happened. Fine, it happened. Okay,
that&#39;s called it comes up and you let
go. How do you let go? My experience is
you relax. That&#39;s the essence of
spirituality. In order to resist
something, you have to tense and use
energy to push it away. I&#39;m resisting
what you said. I don&#39;t like what you
said. I can&#39;t handle what you said. I
will not accept what you said or did.
I&#39;m in here resisting it. Then it stays.
You didn&#39;t let it pass. Letting go,
acceptance, surrender.
These are inner states in which you
learn it&#39;s not worth keeping this in
here. There are people that something
happens and it ruined their entire
relationship. There are people that are
married and somebody thinks they got
cheated on. They didn&#39;t, by the way, but
they saw something made their mind think
cuz they saw a movie once and it was
like that. That all that stuff gets in
there, does it not? And now you think
your mind&#39;s thinking about it all the
time. Next thing you know, a year later,
you&#39;re divorced. You did that. Well, how
do I know whether they you don&#39;t? No, I
I would never be able to handle if they
ever did anything. Well, maybe you need
to learn handle things because you don&#39;t
know whether they did or didn&#39;t. And you
worry about it. You ruined your life and
you ruined your relationship. What if I
sit there and say, &#34;I love this person.
They love me and I&#39;m open. And if
something happens, I&#39;ll deal with it
when it happens. I won&#39;t worry about it,
think about it, hire somebody to go
check it all out and do everything.&#34; And
do you hear what I&#39;m telling you? You
have to learn to let go. You let go of
the part of you that&#39;s can&#39;t handle
reality and you just keep letting go.
How? Relax. Now, what does that mean? To
resist, you&#39;re going to find out you
tense. Something inside goes like this.
Pushes it away. If you do that, it stays
inside of you. Why? Because you didn&#39;t
let it go. You didn&#39;t get rid of it. You
suppressed it. You kept that energy
inside of you. It will bother you the
next day. If you call out to Sally to
say hello and she doesn&#39;t turn around
and say hello and it offends you and you
get bothered by it, next time you see
Sally, that&#39;s coming back up. If you say
something, Sally, why didn&#39;t you say to
me the other day? Well, I thought we
were or no, I won&#39;t say anything. That&#39;s
called suppression. What about I can
handle it? That&#39;s your highest mantra. I
can handle that this one person on the
planet Earth in one moment didn&#39;t say
You should be insulted that you live at
that level cuz you&#39;re a great being and
you&#39;re bothering yourself by being
distracted by meaningless stuff. You
don&#39;t want to live like that. I don&#39;t
want you to live like that. Well, how do
I not? You learn to let it pass. How?
Keep your hands to yourself inside. But
it hurts. Yeah, it&#39;s got to pass
through. And you just keep letting go.
Letting go. All right. And then you&#39;ll
find out that it didn&#39;t bother you next
time. You learn. It takes time. But you
learn to not resist everything and fight
everything and worry about everything
and get uptight about everything. You
learn to honor and respect. I don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going on. How would I know what&#39;s
going on? It&#39;s like you&#39;re basing
everything you&#39;re thinking based on your
past experiences. Just look look what
you like. What you don&#39;t like. I told
you what if you had a different past
experience. What if instead of something
happened in your past like this, it
happened like that? You&#39;d think totally
different. You&#39;d have a totally
different opinion of what&#39;s going on.
Therefore, you don&#39;t know anything.
Well, how do you live like that? I ask
you, how do you not live like that? You
get to a point where you realize, I&#39;m
I&#39;m bothering myself about everything.
I&#39;m freaking out over everything. I have
all these problems. Okay? Instead, you
just sit here and say, &#34;Okay, how could
I know anything? I&#39;m just in this little
spot. Experience what&#39;s on this spot at
any moment.&#34; And then have a bunch of
moments. God, I can&#39;t say it enough. Do
you get it? You don&#39;t know anything.
Look at me. I don&#39;t care how many books
you read. How many didn&#39;t you read? And
by the way, when you read the book,
based on the experience you had a week
ago, you will interpret that book
differently. You don&#39;t know anything in
relation to what there is to know, which
is everything. And so you learn to let
go and be open and be willing to
experience realities unfolds in front of
you. You just get to have opinions and
preferences, but don&#39;t hold on so much.
How many times have you wanted something
and found when you got it, it was
meaningless? How many times were you
afraid of something when happy it&#39;s not
so bad? You don&#39;t know anything. It&#39;s
okay. It&#39;s reality. Is it not reality?
Statistically, some of you are good
statisticians. Okay? You have one
experience in this one moment compared
to 800 billion zillion that you&#39;re not
having. Statistically, how important is
it because statistically insignificant
and that&#39;s happening every moment of
your life. You&#39;re having one experience
out of all the experiences that could be
happening. I&#39;m not telling you to ignore
anything. Just look at reality. But your
ego can&#39;t live like that. We&#39;re not
willing to live like that. So it makes
up what I know and this is I had this
experience and I know this for sure and
you don&#39;t know squat had a different
experience. You&#39;re behaving totally
different total different opinions likes
dislikes. So you get to the point where
you let go of that part of you. You let
go of this thing you built inside of you
that&#39;s destroying your life based on
your past experiences. You become what&#39;s
called open. And now experiences happen.
If they hit something, it&#39;s a good
thing. It means there was something in
there to get hit. You don&#39;t want it in
there. You want to be open, be able to
handle things. Remember, evolution is
being able to handle things so you&#39;re
not distracted by them. So, you practice
letting go. You just keep letting go.
Keep relaxing and releasing, relaxing,
releasing so that you&#39;re not storing
stuff. Does that mean you don&#39;t interact
with life? Of course, you interact with
life. But interact with life by the the
reality unfolding in front of you. You
look at it. And by the way, it&#39;ll be
totally different if you don&#39;t go into a
moment with opinions and preference and
hopes and dreams and constitute views
and fears. You&#39;re actually able to
experience the moment and you will know
what to do. It&#39;s intuitive. It&#39;s
inspiration. How do you interact now?
Based on your preferences, your hopes
and your dreams and concepts of views
and opinions and fears. They&#39;re nothing.
They have a different experience. You&#39;ll
be different. That&#39;s why the world&#39;s a
mess. It is because everybody is lost in
this little package. And then they&#39;re
trying to make the whole world be the
way they want it to be. That&#39;s what wars
are. That&#39;s what all the messes. That&#39;s
all the imbalances. That&#39;s why imagine
all the people living life at peace.
ain&#39;t what happened now when that
stuff&#39;s going on there. So, you be
something special. You be a spiritual
being. Are you willing to be open? Are
you willing to let go and then interact?
Because you have clarity and
centeredness. What happens if you do
that? And what I want you to get, how
would you like to wake up in the morning
instead of worrying what&#39;s going to
happen today to wake up and say, &#34;Wow, I
get to have another day on the planet
Earth. I don&#39;t care what happens because
I can handle anything that happens.
Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t go to work.&#34; Sure,
you go to work. It&#39;s fun. I mean, I have
a relation. They&#39;re fine. Have a
relationship, but I&#39;m not afraid
that something will go wrong with the
relationship or that something go wrong
at work. Something I I&#39;m just open.
You&#39;re just there, ready to experience
reality. You can only get there when you
finally can say to yourself, I can
handle anything. Not by resisting, not
by damping it down, but by letting it
all can pass through me. Right? You&#39;re
going to die. Some people, they&#39;re 23
years old, they say, &#34;You&#39;re going to
They freak out. I don&#39;t want to die.
You&#39;re going to die. Why&#39;d you say that?
And now, let&#39;s say you&#39;re in a situation
and you have some terrible illness. And
the doctor says, &#34;Well, you had 6 months
left and there&#39;s nothing we can do about
it.&#34; Wow. Okay. I can handle it. I want
you to be able to handle everything and
anything. Imagine that. What happens
when you do that? You&#39;re not being
distracted by this world or by your mind
or by your past emotions. When you stop
being distracted, the consciousness
isn&#39;t pulled down. You will reach a
state where you feel it pulling up by
itself. It&#39;s all the ascend right now.
You don&#39;t realize it, but you will soon.
I hope help talk helps you. Your
consciousness is always being pulled
down. Look what&#39;s going on. Be careful.
It&#39;s being pulled down to the thoughts,
pulled down to the emotions, pulled down
to the world. Always looking down. When
you can handle things, it doesn&#39;t do
that because you don&#39;t have to do that
anymore. The consciousness now ascends
by itself. Now consider spiritual
practices because you ceased to do
what&#39;s making it not go up and the next
thing you know it starts floating up. It
starts going up. You feel it. You feel
it pushing up, pulling up inside and you
keep letting go and it will go up by
itself like a hot air balloon. Take off
its tethers, untether it, and it will go
up. untether your consciousness from
being distracted by your body, emotions
and mind and it will go up naturally. So
that&#39;s the bottom line of spirituality
to practices help. Of course they help.
Anything you do that&#39;s higher than what
you would be doing otherwise. I&#39;m all
for it. Okay. So yeah, it&#39;s not all one
sizefits all. But if your intent is to
let go of yourself, to not be distracted
by the ego, that&#39;s a big one, by the
body and by the emotions, that&#39;s your
intent. Then do the best you can and let
it let it evolve. Excuse me. Let it
cease to be devolved.
All right? I hope you understand some of
it. They&#39;re a very great being. There&#39;s
a line in the Shrema Gita we sing every
morning for 50 years. says the man who
is seeing God sees God everywhere.
That&#39;s because they&#39;re not busy looking
at themselves.
When your conscious cease to look at
you, it sees reality. It sees the
wholeness check of
