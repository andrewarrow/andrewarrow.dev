right, welcome back to another episode
of Paw Patrol with your host, Dr. Jeff
Dykus. Tonight, I&#39;m joined by Dr. Alan
Sherman. Thanks for joining me tonight.
Oh, thank you so much for inviting me.
It&#39;s a pleasure to be with you tonight.
Absolutely. So, for anyone who doesn&#39;t
know who you are, I assume most people
do know, but there may be some who don&#39;t
know, why don&#39;t you go ahead and
introduce yourself and uh give us a
quick little background of of your
career and then we&#39;ll kind of dive
deeper into some of those things.
Sure. I uh uh have been in practice uh
had been in practice from uh 1981 to
2005 in Delory Beach, Florida. And that
was my uh my first love. But um I was
always a kind of a geeky guy like um you
know a lot of our our colleagues are
were were science majors and
love technology and I practiced in the
town uh Delray Beach right next to Boca
Raton where the IBM PC was developed and
then manufactured for many years. Mhm.
So from 81 on, I had engineers coming in
telling me what a exciting uh thing this
was and how it was going to change
everything.
And I and some of my doctor friends
became sort of computer hobbyists. Uh we
would buy the first computers that would
come out when the the memory would come
out when the new operating system was
come would come out. We would be the
first to get them and we would soup up
the computers and make them as fast and
as effective as we could and we bought a
scanner and we did photography on the
computers and
and then they were computer bulletin
boards which were the precursors of the
internet. So, fast forward from 81 uh to
95 when Mark Andreasen, a brilliant
University of Chicago engineer, put out
the Mosaic web browser and uh the
internet became available to everyone in
1995. And I was one of the first to
download the Mosaic browser and uh
started to learn how to set up a website
and set up the podiatry online website
and it was done right here at my desk in
my house. It&#39;s the same desk. It&#39;s the
same house.
That&#39;s crazy.
And uh it was very rudimentary. I
learned the HTML programming on my own
and was able to put up a website and
most importantly a form that the
podiatrist could use when they found
that site to sign up for the newsletter.
And podiatry online was a was a
newsletter that went out at first to
five people and then 50 then 500 then
Um between 1995 and 2000 it grew to um
membership of about 8,000 podiatrists.
Wow. And uh what was it? It was a
discussion forum. It was a publication.
I I shared what I learned about
practicing. I put up the forms I
developed in my practice, the patient
information brochures, and put up
information that I thought would be
helpful um to for them to learn how to
run their practices and treat their
patients better. And so gradually they
started sending in questions and I tried
my best to answer the question quickly
because sometimes they were clinical
questions. I was going to say what kind
of questions are they asking you?
questions regarding the care of patients
and the running of practices and so I
would give them the answer and then new
questions would come in and ultimately
they weren&#39;t entirely satisfied with my
answers and they would write in they
would say oh well in this situation I
use this antibiotic or I build this code
and gradually I was able to step back
from doing all the writing and just
edited this conversation that went on
And we got to the point where every day
I would get five or 10 letters to the
editor uh which I would then format into
this emailing and it was it had gone out
once a month and once a week. Eventually
it was once a day by um by the year 2000
and it was taking up a lot of my time. I
was still practicing. Yeah. And my
family was wondering why they were
always seeing the back of my head and um
and what dad was doing um at the
computer here.
You were solving all the podiatry
problems in the world all at once.
I I was having so much fun, Jeff, just
uh hosting this discussion and it was it
was intellectually stimulating and
interesting to me. Mhm.
And about that time, a a good friend of
mine, Michael Shore, was interested in
what I was doing, and he said, &#34;Well,
you can make a business out of this.&#34;
And I was saying, &#34;Well, that would be
nice. Um, what do you think we should
do?&#34; So, um, he started um, trying to
sell banner ads. And in you know the
year 99 and 2000 banner ads were mostly
being done by high-tech companies um and
not so much medical supply
pharmaceutical and device companies but
he tried and he sold some contracts and
I sold a contract to um uh Jansen part
of Jay and but it was still you know it
wasn&#39;t anything life-changing
and then one day I got a phone call from
a woman named Linda Otori. And Linda was
the CEO, newly hired CEO of More
Medical. And uh you you know your
audience knows More Medical. They were a
large supplier to podiatrists at the
And Linda had been hired
coincidentally from IBM, which was in
Boca Raton. and she was hired by more
medical to create an e
sales channel to start marketing on the
internet which was still pretty new in
in 2000. And so she had brought in
Enterprise Software and she developed a
website for them. And she had heard from
a good friend of mine, a podiatrist
named Henry Stark who practices near
uh, that Alan Sherman had this internet
community and he had a whole lot of
email addresses and Linda was interested
in using those to market to those those
people. and and the first thing out of
her mouth is, &#34;Well, I heard about you
from Henry Stark. We would like to buy
And I didn&#39;t know the first thing about
selling a company. Um, I was running a
podiatry practice. It was a pretty
simple business at that time. It&#39;s
gotten a little more complex since then.
So, I talked to Michael. I said, &#34;I&#39;d
get back to you.&#34; I talked to Michael
about this. Michael got all excited. And
Michael brought in his cousin Vic
Weinstein who was a fascinating guy who
had sold a company already. So Vic was
one of the founders of the emer board of
emergency medicine. He was an emergency
physician and he had developed the model
of outsourcing the running of emergency
rooms and he was flying all over the
country signing up hospitals to
outsource the running of their emergency
departments. He eventually went on to do
radiology and pathology. Vic agreed to
help us with the sale of podiatry online
and uh he brought in a uh a very
talented attorney and we started
negotiating with more medical and I can
tell you that whenever we we were in a
meeting with more medical, Vic um and
the attorney were the smartest guys in
the room and we did this dance with them
for 3 months and they eventually bought
Mhm. And part of the buying of us was
having us continue to run the service.
And uh we did that for a couple of
years, but ultimately they continued to
employ us for a couple of years until
2002 when their plan all along was to
get acquired. So More Medical received
an offer to buy them by McKessan, the
hospital supply company, and McKessan
eventually bought More Medical and um
they made Linda&#39;s stock worth a fortune.
She did really well. The first thing
they did was they fired her and they
took over uh the running of the company
and they outsourced the running of
Podiatry online to a company that was
doing something similar in the field of
emergency medicine actually
coincidentally and in 9 months it was
So why did they want to buy you if you
were just having some a few banner ads
here and there? Did they want the reach
that you had or what was their reason
for buying you?
Turns out, Jeff, they had two reasons.
Um, a at two different levels. One, yes,
they wanted the mailing list. They
wanted we we had a mailing list of about
twothirds of the podiatrists in the
country. But more than that, Linda
wanted to be acquired by by someone. And
so she would have us fly up to New
Brick, Connecticut twice a year and
present to them on how to do marketing
to podiatrists. And we had something
called an earnout, which was a clause in
the contract to buy us that if we
improved the sales to podiatrists, we
got an incredible earnout. It turns out
that wasn&#39;t so easy and the sales to
podiatrist just went up a little bit
during that time. But the marketing
plans that we gave to them were part of
their um CIM, their confidential
information memorandum to get acquired.
And that was part of why McKessan bought
them because they saw that this was this
this had this potential. And um so uh so
in 2002 they were acquired. Um we were
fired and Michael and I were back to our
practices and we had had this exciting
experience. We had made a bunch of money
and we started looking for something
else to do and that something else
became present e-learning systems. We
started you know we we we started
present initially as a solution for the
residency directors to have formal
educational programs that they can offer
because in order to be qualified for CMS
funding of the residency programs they
had to be doing an hour of formal
teaching each week and you know back
then a lot of the programs were not in
teaching hospitals they were in
community hospitals special surgery
hospitals and the docs needed help doing
that. And initially
our solution for them was to put do a
PowerPoint exchange to upload everyone&#39;s
PowerPoint and allow them to download
them and use each other&#39;s PowerPoint to
do the teaching. But this was 2002 and
fast internet connections were starting
to become widely available. And I I
thought we could do better than that and
actually create the programming. So I
started researching what that would take
and we adopted this early technology for
recording lectures. In the first year we
developed the curriculum for the first
year residents and then the next year we
did the second and third. So we
eventually had one lecture a week for
each of the residents while they&#39;re in
their three-year programs.
and um it was a subscription model still
is and the hospitals bought the
subscriptions and that was our first
product is present for residency
education.
Yeah, I think that makes a whole lot of
sense. So, it&#39;s interesting to see the
dynamic of what you started with and
then kind of adapting as technology
changes, right? So, and early on there
was no there no chance you could do high
resolution video and video live video
conferencing, right? The internet speeds
were just if you could get an internet
text website to load, you were happy.
Oh, good. I my my dialup went through.
It didn&#39;t get a busy signal. I got the
internet website to load. And you can
get that information. What people are
used to from a technological standpoint
is going to change with time. If you
still have the same model today where it
was just textbased, that may not uh
appease every single person who&#39;s used
to having high-speed internet and video
and high definition this and high
definition that. Well, how have you seen
present kind of change from its initial,
like you said, with the residencies to
where you&#39;re at now with managing
multiple conferences and all the
information that&#39;s out there? How do you
kind of how have you seen that flow
change through the years?
Well, I mean, you&#39;re you&#39;re living it.
You&#39;re doing multi- um uh channel
publishing of these podcasts, which is
is is fantastic.
That had to all be done manually in in
2002 on. So, we started with a company
called Mediaite. They were sort of a
proprietary box that you would get that
we would bring to live settings in in
our offices in Boca Raton or or when we
started doing conferences and we would
record using media site and eventually
we realized that we were better off
doing that ourselves and recording pure
video. Video became, you know, a very
ubiquitous. It&#39;s all over the place and
you you know the story of YouTube uh the
the incredible volume of publishing that
that they&#39;re doing. So, you know, how
has it changed? You know, back then we
had a a a a simple delivery site. We had
to develop a learning management system
because, you know, when we were
delivering just to the residents, it was
it didn&#39;t have to be accredited
education, but starting in 2005, we
started publishing for CME. And back
then, we had partners. First the Ohio
school, the New York school were our
co-providers to be able to deliver, you
know, CPME accredited education.
Eventually, we applied for and obtained
our our own accreditation through CPME.
And the learning management system was
rudimentary at first, but it&#39;s become a
very sophisticated piece of software
that does a whole lot of stuff now. And
we&#39;ve had this experience over and over
again of needing technology. And then I
love shopping and the internet is the
best shopping mall there&#39;s ever been.
I I I again shopped for software in
order to use that to solve issues that
we&#39;ve had only to find that it didn&#39;t it
wasn&#39;t customizable enough and we
couldn&#39;t make it particular enough for
our needs. So we&#39;ve through the years
only only used our own software. I am
lucky enough to have met a fellow named
Don Garland who I hired in 2003 I
believe and he is still my IT director
and and the the architect of all of our
software. He&#39;s brilliant and he is a
self-arner. He didn&#39;t go to college. He
taught himself and he he now has a
family and is a grown-up dude. But he
was a young guy when he started working
for us. And he designed I mean I I&#39;m
sort of the director of the software
development but I don&#39;t do any
programming not since the HTML days.
So John it puts into practice everything
that I want on the website. And so today
it stores the um the the educational
materials. It stores the publishing that
we do. Mhm.
It um it is a vending machine for it.
So, it accepts payments. It issues CME.
Over the years, we developed the
capabilities to issue certificates,
PDFs, u but they&#39;re stored as data on
the website.
Uh we made the commitment years ago to
be the the way by which podiatrists keep
track of their CME. So when you are in
CME from present whether it&#39;s from the
ondemand lectures the live inerson
conferences or the virtual conferences
or the webinars we store all of those
CMEs and have the capabilities now you
go to your your your account and you can
print out a transcript so that you can
report to your whole year your specialty
Mhm. Two years ago, we added the
capability to keep track of CME that you
earn anywhere. Um, and you can enter
that on the site and that gets stored
along with what you&#39;ve earned with FZEN.
So, that&#39;s part of the learning
management system. Now,
that&#39;s really interesting. What role?
So, you kind of have your foot in
multiple arenas with the live
conferences and the online CME. I know
some states limit the amount of li
online CME that you can get as a portion
of your total CMEs, but how do you
what&#39;s your view on live CME versus
online CME? And which one do you prefer?
Which what are your thoughts on on each
of those because they&#39;re they&#39;re quite
different or they can be in terms of the
experience that people have in a live
like butt in seat versus clicking a
mouse in front of a computer. What are
your thoughts on those and how they
We started doing conferences in 2005.
It&#39;s 20 been 20 years now and um we we
realized that so much of the education
was taking even though we were early
with with online so much of the
education was taking place at
conferences. We wanted to be a part of
that. And so we were friends with the
people that were doing the Superb Bones
conference with Stan Kish and John
Steinberg, Richard Rutder and we talked
to them one time and they said, you
know, maybe you could help us do some of
the logistics of running these meetings.
They wanted to do the academic
programming. They were good at it. They
needed help with the marketing and the
management of the meetings. So we went
to work with them one year. Um it it
they found it helpful. The next year we
we bought the company from them and we
continued to work with them to run it.
We did the same thing with Bob Fryberg
who is running the Superb Bones I mean
the uh Desert Foot Conference for the
Um we offered help to them and then we
he allowed us to take that over. Then we
started the residency summit
conferences. So you know there&#39;s there
will always be inerson professional
conferences. There&#39;s a reason why people
go to conferences. You know, the
collegialness,
the interpersonal networking, certainly
conferences where papers are delivered
and research is presented. There&#39;ll
always be that. But what we got to the
point where we were doing seven
conferences a year and then there was a
little epidemic called CO and CO um shut
down so many industries but it
completely shut down the live events
industry. Las Vegas was silent. So it
was a McCormack place and the Javis
Center. It was incredible. So we had to
learn how to do something like a inerson
conference online. And so in you know in
early uh 2020 I was shopping for a live
streaming software and it was a it was
the wild west out there and you know not
to get into all the technical details.
We started with one company and had a
kind of a rough experience. We had
people waiting, you know, teachers
waiting to to get on stage virtually and
something happened and the conversations
we were having with them were were uh
were getting broadcast live instead of
the lectures and um it was difficult. Um
the third one we did with a platform
that um was much easier to use and we&#39;re
still using that platform today and
we&#39;ve done um over a hundred um uh it
may be 150 now um streaming conferences.
So the whole world changed and in in
we delivered uh over 100,000
CME credits to podiatrists because there
was nothing else and um and uh many of
them knew about us um already and that
became the way to get CME. Um and you
know fortunately now we&#39;ve been able to
get back to inerson conferences and um I
really miss them and so all of that
doing all of that is done from our
learning management system and so we&#39;ve
had to add on all these different
features in order to accommodate those
different types of education. I wonder
what percentage of people, you know,
during the pandemic, nobody could go to,
well, a certain portion of the
population didn&#39;t go to work and they
worked from home and then they got used
to that. It was a little too good and
they&#39;re like, I&#39;m not going back. I&#39;m
working from home. I wonder what
percentage of people realize, oh, I can
just do my CME from home. I don&#39;t have
to book a flight. I don&#39;t have to book a
hotel. I don&#39;t have to take time off of
work. I don&#39;t have to be away from my
family. I can just do these CMEs online.
I bet there was a portion of the
population who had never considered that
before until they needed to and then
they realized, well, this is easy. I&#39;m
just going to do this from now on
because I do think there&#39;s a distinction
there between live or I should say
online CMEs being easy and in-person
CMEs being fun. You get to see all your
friends, your buddies from residency,
people you haven&#39;t seen for years, and
you meet up after the conference, not
only at the physical lectures, but
dinners and events outside of it. So,
they are very different to me, and I
think they fill a different niche. But I
wonder how many people akin to the
people who started working from home and
then just said, &#34;I&#39;m not going back into
the office.&#34; They just started doing
them online. And did you see a residual
bump in the online after that
unfortunate reason to have a bump?
So you&#39;re ab you&#39;re absolutely right. Uh
that that co experience changed the
nature of education in medicine and many
of the people that learned to like that
as an alternative to inerson conferences
have stuck with it. on demand CME, the
pre-recorded lectures have become our
biggest way to deliver CME. And so, and
then there&#39;s the virtual streaming
conferences, the actual conferences that
you don&#39;t have to leave your home to
experience. And there we&#39;re finding that
different individuals seem to like
different media in this regard. So there
are people that get as much CME as they
can um with on demand. There is no limit
in most cases to getting your CME
through streaming conferences. CPME
considers streaming online equal to in
person in in every way.
But different people like different
forms. I mean this last couple years we
developed this DEA mate training that
everyone that has a DEA license has to
get and we we deliver that in two
different forms by a live streaming a
one-day event and on demand and they&#39;re
both getting a lot of traction but the
the on demand gets gets much more.
Yeah, I I actually did that. I did your
online DEA because that was a new
requirement from the DEA that you&#39;ve had
certain number of continuing education
credits in that specific training
regard. So that was the easiest way to
get it. So that makes sense.
And that&#39;s what people want. They want
convenience. And we have this joke that
a lot of the people that are attending
are um our our streaming or on demand
education are not wearing pants. Um
you&#39;re at home. You you do what you
want. If you want to go, you know, go
and get a sandwich, you&#39;re able to. It
uh ultimately it respects the learner
because when people go to a conference
though they are in lectures, you know,
six or eight hours a day, nobody&#39;s
paying attention for six or eight hours.
It&#39;s very demanding. They pay attention
to what they&#39;re interested in and always
have. and on on demand respects that it
lets them learn what they want to learn
and even streaming lets them do that to
to an extent. And um I think the docs
don&#39;t want to be coralled and they don&#39;t
want to be treated like children. They
um they&#39;re getting the education for two
reasons. because it&#39;s a regulatory
requirement of renewing your license.
It&#39;s something you have to do, but also
they want to keep up and they want to
continue to learn and and that&#39;s a
convenient way to do that.
Absolutely. You were joking about people
not wearing pants. At least they don&#39;t
have their cameras on when they&#39;re
absorbing this information. And I was on
a meeting one time and someone didn&#39;t
know they had their camera on and he was
laying in bed with no pants on in a
hotel room and it was
very uncomfortable cuz all of us could
see everyone else and he didn&#39;t know he
had his camera on. So at least during
these live streams and things they&#39;re
they&#39;re not uh it&#39;s not a two-way
So Jeeoff, all of this is culminated in
a project that I&#39;ve been working on for
the last two years. I&#39;d like to talk
about it a little bit if I&#39;m if that&#39;s
okay with you.
Absolutely. Tell us about the next
advancement in technology.
So, I&#39;m very excited about this. So, um
I&#39;ve in the last few years I came to
realize that we&#39;ve recorded and have a
tremendous amount of teaching. It it
totals over a thousand hours of teaching
by people that we&#39;ve selected that we
thought were the best people to teach
each particular topic area. But for the
purpose of accessibility,
it was in the worst possible form. It
was in video. So uh you know when we
publish a lecture we write a description
about it. We write a quiz and we have a
title for it and that&#39;s all that was
searchable. So, uh, when if someone had
a particular question and they went to
the website, they might be directed to a
lecture on, you know, rear foot
fractures or, um, or wound care, uh, but
they weren&#39;t getting good hits on our
searches for particular questions.
Sure. And um then AI was delivered, you
know, by Chat GPT and and Sam Alman and
um and I realized two years ago that um
this was um a a a great opportunity for
us. So um my programmer John and I had a
series of meetings and we decided that
we were going to create an AI based on
the teaching that we&#39;ve recorded. And um
it presented um a whole bunch of
interesting technological challenges but
the AI helped us solve the helped us
develop the AI and in the next couple of
months we&#39;re going to release access to
it. So what did we do? AI services to
listen to all the lectures and
transcribe them into text and put them
into a vector model and build a we built
a large learning model around it to use
all that information and you know so
this is teaching by Harold Leonhouse and
Guido Leaporta and Larry D. Dominico and
Jared Shapiro and Marie Williams. And so
we released our first model for testing
about 6 months ago. We brought it to one
of our meetings. We had our faculty sit
down and throw questions at it and we
programmed it so that it would give
answers sort of like up to-date one-page
summary answers that were highly
outlined. And you know, it&#39;s not
perfect. Uh AIs aren&#39;t perfect.
Sometimes they give strange answers. You
know, more than 90% of the time it&#39;s
giving answers that are useful and uh
we&#39;re um we&#39;re putting the finishing
touches on this. We&#39;re going to be
releasing this with a new version of our
lecture hall. The way the lectures are
delivered on the site, it&#39;s going to be
integrated into that. And not only are
our customers
um going to be able to use this, but
we&#39;re going to be using it to help
maintain the curriculum.
So I have this job every year of
maintaining a curriculum of about 550
lectures. And lectures are fresh
product. So every year we take between
20 and 30% of them out of circulation
when they time out and we put new ones
in. But uh making sure that we always
have a a complete curriculum has gotten
very hard to do manually. We we have an
annual meeting, a curriculum committee
meeting that where where we do this. But
now the AI is going to help us. We&#39;ll be
able to ask the question, how many
lectures do we have that deal with
calccanial fractures? And it&#39;ll give us
a list of them and we&#39;ll be able to
maintain that so much better.
Yeah, I think that&#39;s fascinating. And
you and I were kind of talking a little
bit earlier about the utility of AI and
the fact that AI is here to stay. And if
you don&#39;t find a way to adapt and
utilize AI to your benefit, I think
you&#39;re going to be left behind as
technology continues to advance. And it
seems to be exponentially advancing. You
know, we how went for how many thousands
of years with no technology, no
internet, TV, phones, high resolution
video, and now we have AI. It just seems
to be exponentially
expanding. And so, I think it makes a
whole lot of sense to be able to harness
that ability for you because it does
make a lot of tasks easier. I don&#39;t love
the idea that AI could replace certain
aspects of what we do. So I think it&#39;s
an interesting topic for you to talk
about. Do you ever envision a day where
AI takes the place as the educator
instead of the humans delivering the
Oh, I thought you were going in a
different direction with this. Um, you
know, I thought you were gonna ask me
whether AI can take over what
podiatrists are doing. Um, but um,
let&#39;s leave that for another day. We&#39;re
gonna make people angry with that one.
As far as education, it&#39;s the greatest
tool that&#39;s ever been developed for
educators.
So, um, Google has a product called, um,
notebook is a product that allows you to
upload documents. In this case, you
know, it could be academic articles. It
could be chapters of books. I&#39;ve used
it. I&#39;ve uploaded, you know, Jared&#39;s
articles to it and it then can summarize
that. It can put it into the form of a
you can say, &#34;Give me a 20 slide
PowerPoint file.&#34; And it makes the file.
It does something that is a whisbang
feature that I I thought I think is
amazing. It&#39;ll make a podcast. H.
So, I uploaded half a dozen of Jared&#39;s
articles and I I said, &#34;Make a podcast
out of this.&#34; And it made a halfhour
podcast where two people get on and
they&#39;re conversational. They say they
say, &#34;Welcome to today&#39;s podcast. We
have an interesting topic for you.&#34; And
then the other person comes on and they
say, &#34;This was one of my favorite ones
to do.&#34; They start discussing this back
and forth and it&#39;s entertaining and
conversational. And in the case of
Jared&#39;s articles, it made one mistake.
It made a conclusion from a premise and
recommended a treatment that it was
wrong. So it has to it has to be proof
read. For our purposes, it&#39;s probably
not the greatest, but for most people,
it&#39;s unbelievable.
It&#39;s really interesting. I mean, I&#39;ve
played around with things like that
before and there&#39;s a line there, I
think, from an art standpoint, whether
it be podcast or artwork or music, that
if it loses the human aspect.
I struggle with that. If you if a
painting is beautiful, but it was made
by AI,
but you didn&#39;t know it was made by AI,
is the painting still beautiful? It&#39;s
this weird we&#39;re living in this very
transitional zone right now.
It is. Um I get I think the real
question is is it art? Um it it&#39;s
there&#39;s no question that AI art is
beautiful. Um, uh, I have a friend that
sent knows I love architecture and sends
me these, uh, pictures of houses and not
knowing that they were all AI and
they&#39;re they&#39;re fant, you know, a house
on the side of a cliff. Um, that that
could never maybe it could be built, I
don&#39;t know. Yeah.
this is a very interesting discussion
that we can go on for hours with, but I
I think the the answer that I would give
to your question is that it is the
greatest tool ever developed for
teaching and it is going to do some
teaching by itself. There is no question
about it. Have you ever heard of Khan
Oh, yes. So Khan Academy, Salman Khan
was good friends with Sam Alman and Sam
Alman called him in about a month before
he he he delivered Chad TPT and gave
Salomon the opportunity to use the early
version of it to develop anything that
he wanted. But what he developed was a
tutor for the students. And that has
become so sophisticated that now
teachers assign this tutor to kids. And
here&#39;s an example of what it does. It
makes education entertaining. Well,
voluntarily when it&#39;s teaching of the uh
early American history, it develops a
dialogue with the student with George
Washington and they can talk to George
Washington and learn about why he made
particular decisions.
It&#39;s crazy.
It is is a tutor. It&#39;s it it&#39;s um it it
it&#39;s an educator that&#39;s working with the
students now just like a person would.
I think it&#39;s fascinating to think about.
So my wife teaches at the school here at
De Mo University and we&#39;ve had this
discussion before cuz I&#39;m intrigued by
AI and we were talking about whether or
not AI whether or not you could create
essentially an AI medical school. Could
you create an online school that was
delivered by AI? the lectures were given
by a they were designed and developed by
AI and whether or not that would I
assume if the people took the lectures
regardless of how they obtained the
information and they passed the required
tests then they have then completed
medical school. They are a doctor
regardless of how they obtain that
information. And she was a little bit
defensive because she works at the
school and she is the lecture and she is
the teacher and there are some not some
there are all the social dynamics that
AI cannot provide that are collegiality
between a student and professor and all
those things but I think it&#39;s
fascinating to think about of right now
we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know so it&#39;s
going to look funny in 10 years when all
the medical schools are you know
AIdriven and they don&#39;t even have
professors anymore maybe 50 years who
knows But um it&#39;s interesting to think
I I guess it you know it depends on what
you expect the source material to be
too. I don&#39;t know how much um you know
medical teaching is on the internet and
is now in in the AI. I mean let&#39;s after
we get off let&#39;s go to perplexity or
chat GPT and say give me a lecture on um
on uh you know diabetic related
infectious disease and see what it comes
up with. I I um you know what the the I
think the benefit of our AI is going to
be that we know what the source material
is. The source material has been the
teaching that&#39;s gone on with in in
present education for 20 years.
Yes. I think that&#39;s the most important
part of that
and I think that is going to be the the
greatest value of AIS. Look uh companies
all over the world now are trying to
develop AIS to have better access to
their own data. legal firms, research
entities, product manufacturers have all
this data that they&#39;ve been collecting
and they don&#39;t have great capability of
reaching into it and getting answers out
of it. The AI is going to do that for
private data sources. I think the the
podiatry schools, medical schools would
be missing a great opportunity if they
didn&#39;t do the same thing. They&#39;ve
recorded their lectures for years also.
They can do exactly what I what I&#39;m
doing. Um, they can do it with their
teaching as well.
Absolutely. I was thinking the exact
same thing that you were. What are the
most popular CME
topics? What are the things that people
are I assume you can track the data of
which ones get clicked on the most and
because at the end of the day all you
need are certain number of hours of CME.
Which topics you select to get that CME
is up to you. What topics are the most
in podiatry? It&#39;s infectious disease,
biomechanics and practice management
are the the three that um are viewed the
most often and we have evidence on that
from another direction as well. After
every education activity that we
deliver, there has to be a survey and
there has to be a question asked. What
topics would you like us to present next
to help you best run your your practice
and treat your patients? And those same
topics come up um in that same order.
That makes sense because people
selfishly,
I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a better word
for it, but we&#39;ll just use selfishly,
want to learn about the things that are
going to benefit them. If they don&#39;t see
calccanial fractures, I don&#39;t want to
see a lecture on calccanial fractures. I
want to see practice management, my
billing, my coding, my am I doing this
correctly? Could I be doing that better?
And selfishly, they want that
information. So, that makes a whole lot
of sense. They want the the topics that
they&#39;re going to utilize. Yeah, they and
and that&#39;s true. Yet, um I think
everyone wants to have a liberal
education and so they&#39;re willing to sit
through some lectures on things that
they don&#39;t see very much just so they&#39;re
informed about it.
But um but they need to be up todate
with the latest on the things that you
know that they&#39;re seeing every day in
and out.
Yeah. So you&#39;ve been around this field
long enough. You&#39;ve been to many
conferences. You&#39;ve watched all these
lectures. you run the platform that
hosts all these lectures. What do you
think makes the best lecture? Is it that
they have some humor, the that they&#39;re
charismatic, that they have the
experience behind them to give tips and
pearls, or what things do you value in a
lecture the most?
Warren Joseph
is uh is my answer. um he consistently
gets the most enthusiastic audiences and
um and and we pack the lecture hall when
he when he comes um because um he
personality. He&#39;s got a warm wonderful
personality. Everyone loves Warren. Um
he he he&#39;s funny and um he stacks the
education in um such a way that it&#39;s
easiest to learn. He&#39;s a great great
certainly not the only one, but he comes
to mind when I think of the the best
teacher that I know.
Yeah, absolutely. I think if you can
keep people engaged, whether that be
fantastic information from your
experience or whether you throw in the
humor, but if you can keep people
engaged, they&#39;re going to obviously view
that as a better experience than if they
somehow disconnect mentally halfway
through. Look, um, you know, people want
the information, but they they want to
be entertained and and also a good
teacher makes things easier to learn.
They, uh, they put things in an outline,
they order it, um, they repeat, they use
all the techniques in adult learning to
make it easier for you to learn. Some
guys are, you know, very smart and they,
you know, they get up there and they
talk about their experiences. They show
their cases. It&#39;s exciting, but they,
you know, they&#39;re not always great great
teachers. Harold Shown House, another
example of a teacher that everyone seems
to gravitate towards.
Guidelora, I mean, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll listen to
him lecture on on on anything. He&#39;s
brilliant.
Yeah, absolutely. So, basically, they
need to be all the above. Have some
humor, charismatic, they have to have
the education behind them, the
experience.
It&#39;s a learned skill, too. I think they
get better throughout their career. very
much. So, how have you seen podiatry
change over the years? What are some of
the biggest things that you&#39;ve noticed?
Because you&#39;ve been deep inside the
profession. Some people live on the
outskirts and they just go to work, see
other patients, come home, they don&#39;t
get on any online forums and any of that
stuff. What are some of the biggest
changes that you&#39;ve seen through
podiatry over the years?
Well, I mean, when I graduated uh CCPM
in 1981, only half of us uh were able to
get residencies. Um this the
standardizing our our our residencies to
a three-year model um was a great
advance for us.
Um I think we have reached the time in
our history where we need to consider
whether we&#39;re serving the public best
with that model. There have been there&#39;s
been a lot of discussion particularly in
PM news but every time we get together
whether we should be subjecting every
student to a predominantly surgery
oriented residency because ultimately
they&#39;re not all going to be
predominantly surgeons and you know the
more you know the more you learn the
better. I&#39;ve always believed that there
isn&#39;t a case of too much education, but
I would like the resources to be used
more effectively and I my feeling is
that after a year of residency, the
directors and the residents know whether
they&#39;re going to be the the person who&#39;s
going to be um you know doing open
reduction of ankle fractures and rear
you know rear foot reconstructions and
and so why if if if if 20 or 75% of them
are going to be those surgeons, but 75%
are going to be doing office-based
podiatry and some some surgery.
Why put them all through the second and
third year of of and and put them
through the demands of that? And
shouldn&#39;t those cases be going to the
the 25 or 30% that are ultimately going
to be, you know, doing those procedures?
So um that&#39;s that&#39;s my feeling that we
have we&#39;ve done great things for oursel
by the residency the quality of the
residency education has never been
better and the quality of the people
we&#39;re putting out has never been better
but I think we should take a a deep
breath and a pause now and and decide
whether it&#39;s makes sense for every
I tend to agree with you I&#39;ve had a few
guests bring up similar concerns as as
you there are some potential pitfalls of
that and what number do you lay out as
this many of you get to be a surgeon and
250 of you do but there&#39;s 251 of you who
want to be a surgeon so how do you
decide who gets to be a surgeon and then
from a marketing standpoint on the front
end I think one of the things that
people sometimes are drawn to is hey if
you go into MD or do school and you want
to be a surgeon you may or may not get a
surgical residency but if you come to
podiatry you&#39;re going to get to be a
surgeon And those are the devil&#39;s
advocate components on the flip side of
what you&#39;re saying. But I do tend to
agree with you that not everyone is cut
out to be a surgeon and not everyone
knows that they aren&#39;t cut out to be a
surgeon unfortunately and they have to
find out the hard way. But I tend to
agree with you. That&#39;s an interesting
thing because are we taking a step
backwards because we work so hard one
year, two year, three year standardized
residencies. Okay, everyone has the same
training across the country. Is it going
to be viewed as a step backwards to say,
&#34;Well, now we&#39;re going to go back and
say, okay, you get a one-year residency,
you get to learn some forefoot, but some
of you get to go on and do rear foot
ankle training.&#34;
Well, I think everyone should I think we
should stay standard on three years. I
just think we should have different
types of residencies.
And we have a problem right now that is
is is we&#39;re working at at solving it,
but we haven&#39;t solved it yet. And that
is the decreased applicant pool. Mhm.
And I&#39;m very concerned about that. And I
personally feel that we&#39;re discouraging
a lot of applicants to podiatry school
by um by demanding that every podiatrist
be a surgeon. I think there are a lot of
people that would like to be a
office-based podiatrist, maybe do, you
know, wound care, do sports medicine, do
dance medicine. um because we&#39;re
demanding that they go through a
three-year surgical residency. They&#39;re
discouraged from applying. You know,
it&#39;s not the only reason that the
applicant pool has decreased. The pro I
think the biggest reason is the growth
in the number of of MD and and
particularly DO schools as an
alternative that when you&#39;re faced with
you know a career choice and you can go
into podiatry where you&#39;re tracked into
being this particular kind of person or
you can go to DO or MD school where you
could be a great variety of different
kinds of people. I think the DO and MD
school seems more attractive to a lot of
Yeah, I think it&#39;s tough. think it&#39;s
hard to because my wife and I obviously
have these conversations about the
applicant pool and all those things and
if schools are going to continue to fill
their classes fine that&#39;s one thing but
if the applicant pool is significantly
higher then you&#39;re drawing a better
quality of metriculent through the
program versus just filling your
classes. So, yes, the schools, well,
some of them may still be filling their
classes, but we&#39;re worried about that
downstream issue of, okay, are we just
accepting people who really shouldn&#39;t
have gotten in because the applicant
pool is so low, and then that&#39;s going to
put out a lower quality physician in the
future and then is that going to ruin
the reputation that we&#39;ve worked so hard
to build upon? There&#39;s a lot there. I
don&#39;t know that we have time to dive
deep into that.
I&#39;m concerned about the viability of all
all these schools, you know. Yeah, these
this is a complicated issue. I I think
we we all need to be talking about this
and coming up with each of our own ideas
for how to solve this problem and then
come together and make a good decision
about it ultimately. But um when I read
these these discussions, I I&#39;m I&#39;m
concerned that we&#39;re discouraging too
many people from applying to because of
the one model that we&#39;re we&#39;re running
Sure. I&#39;ve had about four or five people
reach out to me and say that they became
interested in podiatry because they
found my podcast. So, I&#39;m doing my part
over here. So, I don&#39;t know what the
rest of you guys are doing, but I&#39;m
doing my part.
You&#39;re doing you&#39;re doing great and um
it&#39;s so good to have um this kind of
publishing going on and these kind of
dialogues made available to people and
uh I applaud you for that.
Well, thank you so much. I appreciate
it. So most of my audience is is quite
young, 20 to 35 or so. And so they may
not be at the uh time in their career
where they need CME yet. But for those
who aren&#39;t quite at that stage and are
going to be looking to get CME, tell the
people where they can go to find you at
your website. You got the uh you got
there early, didn&#39;t you?
I I did. Uh I I I that was a good
opportunity. So, just go to podiatry.com
and everything that you need as far as
CME uh and education in general is right
there for you.
Absolutely. It&#39;s got it all.
podiatry.com. Check it out. Thank you so
much for joining me tonight. I
appreciate your time.
Thanks very much, Jeeoff. This was a
Absolutely. Thank you everyone for
joining me on this episode of Paw Patrol
with your host, Dr. Jeff Dyus. We&#39;ll see
you next time.
