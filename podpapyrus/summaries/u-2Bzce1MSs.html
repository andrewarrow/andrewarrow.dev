Now that you have two children,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do what what has changed about you? Do
you think you&#39;re more more patient or do
you flip out more?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. I mean, I feel like
patience is something I could always
work on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, me too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s hard, especially, you
know, there&#39;s when it&#39;s the two of them
versus me. The number of times I&#39;ve been
like, &#34;Guys, there&#39;s two of you and one
of me. Like, I need a little patience.
You got to help me out here.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How um how difficult is it really having
kids? Like people will say, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s
the best thing that&#39;s ever happened.&#34;
And, you know, my friend Chris put it to
me in lameness. He&#39;s like, &#34;Listen, man.
No one&#39;s going to tell you this.&#34;
But sometimes,
sometimes your deepest, darkest thoughts
come out in your head, and you just got
to go,
man, and you somehow suck it up and do
it. Um, it it can&#39;t be easy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it&#39;s not easy, but I mean, there&#39;s a
magic to it. Like, yes. Is it
exhausting? Is it challenging? Is it so
much harder than I ever imagined it
would be? Absolutely.
But it&#39;s also magical.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Magical.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;re little U&#39;s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And little hazes,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but better. Like, and also their own
version of themselves, constantly
revealing themselves to us. Um, you
know, I mean, you have dogs. That&#39;s And
I know you love your dogs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. That&#39;s that&#39;s a Yeah. And by the
way, if anything ever happened to my
dogs, I would just be distraught.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So imagine children.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s another
thing. And it&#39;s also like,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, your past, like your
childhood, if you, you know, I always
felt like, you know, I don&#39;t want to
have kids because I I just I I be too
hard on myself. I just they have to be
perfect. They have I have to I don&#39;t
want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up. I don&#39;t want to be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. But I think the truth of the
matter is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you&#39;re going to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I&#39;m going to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And you know, all I can do is try
and set a good example for them. And
when I do, apologize and you know, try
and make it right.
