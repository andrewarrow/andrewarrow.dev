When I came out on stage here tonight, I
said, &#34;This Dallas audience wants to
listen to the Quiet Songs.&#34; Am I right?
I hope so. In both his solo career and
fronting Genesis, Phil Collins dominated
the 1980s. His many ballads crowded the
radio. His rounded face loomed from
record store shelves. and everywhere.
The Academy Awards, Band-Aid, Live Aid,
Miami Vice, Phil Collins was there.
However, it was a monkeykey&#39;s paw kind
of deal. He became omniresent, but at
the same time became the punchline to
every joke. He sold as many records as
you two or Bruce Springsteen, but the
initial jolt towards a solo career was
when his whole world fell apart. It was
the breakup that spawned that seminal
drum fill, the sound of the 80s, and the
odd persistent urban legend. This is New
British Cannon, and this is the story of
In the Air Tonight.
In 1975, Phil Collins got married to his
on-again, off-again childhood
sweetheart, Canadianborn Andrea
Bertterelli. Having first met and dated
in drama school in London as teenagers,
her family returned to Vancouver, which
ended the relationship. But when the
band he drumed for, Genesis, tooured
Canada for the first time in early 1974
to promote selling England by the pound,
Collins and Bertelli reconnected,
getting married the following January in
the twoe gap between legs of the Lamb
Lies Down on Broadway tour. A spectre of
things to come, there was no time for a
honeymoon. 1975 was a pivotal year for
Genesis. The seven years prior, the band
had become one of Britain&#39;s biggest
concert draws with their elongated art
rock. Audiences allured by their
musicality, intelligence, and their
charismatic frontman Peter Gabriel&#39;s
costumed storytelling. In the eyes of
the press, they were a bunch of toughs,
public school boys who hardly conformed
to the rock and roll standard. their
fans long overcoated fishing hated
student types who either made notes or
spaced out to their labyrinthine epics
like the 23 minute long supper&#39;s ready
to see the children of the west
it&#39;s full of surprise everyone lies like
a fox on a
But despite this association, in April
1974, they managed to earn themselves
their first UK top 40 single with the
beaterless whimsy of I Know What I Like
in Your Wardrobe. A rarity for such an
album focused genre.
I know
what I like.
Furthermore, The Lamb lies down on
Broadway from November 74, an
ungainainely double LP with lyrics and
concept penned almost entirely by
Gabriel. We continue their international
ascent. Their first album to crack the
US Billboard top 50.
But Gabriel tired of the rock and roll
lifestyle. He hated the constant cycle
of writing then touring with no room for
other projects. Complicating matters, he
and his wife were dealing with the
difficult birth of their daughter. The
stress negatively impacted his ability
to write lyrics, resulting in long
instrumental interludes on the Lamb Lie
second LP.
When he told the band of his intention
to leave during a stop in Cleveland, no
one was surprised. He stayed until the
tour wrapped up in June 1975 and left
Genesis without a frontman. After
several months of auditions for a
replacement, training them on new tracks
on the in progress A Trick of the Tale
album. They had found nothing but
disappointment. But as he had been
coaching the applicants through the new
songs and on the suggestion of his wife,
Collins hesitantly stepped up is a
complete lie to suggest that was happy
to jump in after Peter left. Sure, the
perception that Genesis was a one-man
show did frustrate me, but the last
thing I wanted to do was become the
singer. Being the singer was the least
respectable gig in the band as far as I
was concerned. But in the end, the guys
said that I sounded better than the
people I was teaching. Their audience
were not unfamiliar with Collins&#39;s
voice. He had provided harmonies on
Genesis Records since he joined in 1970
and even sang lead a couple of times.
had days of four instead of two
and then the lady would say that she had
It also helped that Collins soft tone
was reminiscent of Gabriel&#39;s. However,
Collins would face an uphill battle in
filling the place of their beloved
former singer. His main worry wasn&#39;t
taking Gabriel&#39;s place as a vocalist so
much as taking his place as a
storyteller. Gabriel told bizarre
stories to keep the audience entertained
while guitarist Mike Rutherford tuned
his 12 string and the surreal anecdotes
had become an important part of the
band&#39;s image. Plus, with former King
Crimson sixman Bill Berford and later
Frank Zapper veteran Chester Thompson
filling in on drums, he felt a bit
exposed on stage when no longer hidden
behind his drum kit. Their first album
with Collins fronting, February 1976&#39;s A
Trick of the Tale, hit number three on
the charts, equaling selling England and
remaining on the UK album chart for 7
Collins was on tour to promote the album
while his pregnant wife stayed at home.
He returned home long enough to witness
the birth of their son, Simon, in
September, but had to leave a few days
later to record a trick of the tales
follow-up, Wind and Withering, in the
Netherlands. His constant absence was
already beginning to impact his new
marriage. But the Genesis industrial
complex must always be moving forward,
stopping for no one. In hindsight, I
could have said, &#34;Genesis, I&#39;m off to
look after my wife.&#34; But we&#39;re all
expected to give everything to the band,
even if there are later recurring
attempts to reverse engineer such
situations. Well, if only you told us,
we could have moved the start date. But
while I&#39;ve been emboldened as a
performer by becoming the frontman,
behind closed doors, I&#39;m too timid to
speak up. Colin&#39;s marriage wasn&#39;t the
only relationship dissolving. Guitarist
Steve Hackett was frustrated with his
bandmates&#39;s lack of interest in his
songwriting efforts. So left during the
mixing sessions for their 1977 live
album, Seconds Out, rather than replace
him, the remaining band members decided
to continue as a free piece, at least on
record. Phil Collins on drums and
vocals, Tony Banks on keyboards, and
Mike Rutherford on guitars and bass. The
resulting album, March 1978&#39;s And Then
There Were Free, saw them move further
away from the extended Prague Rock of
previous releases, instead edging closer
to the Beatles and kink style singles
group they&#39;d always aspired to be. The
atypical love song, Follow You, Follow
Me, was even a UK top 10 single.
Gaining Genesis a bunch of new fans, but
alienating older ones because I had
become the singer a couple albums
earlier. I was given the blame.
Suddenly, there was this guy that not
only can sing and play drums, but he&#39;s
been to drama school. Fans thought he&#39;s
probably Mr. showbiz and he&#39;s pushed
Pete out and it wasn&#39;t like that at all
but it makes a better story. The truth
is we grew up we matured.
In 1978, Genesis went all in to try and
break the US. In the UK, they&#39;d had
hits, their albums were selling well,
but the UK is a much smaller market. At
the time, a British band needed to
commit to touring consistently in the
hopes that their songs might get picked
up by local radio stations in the US.
So, for the resulting 8-month 1978 world
tour, Genesis played 48 dates over three
non-consecutive months in the US and
Canada. After which, Follow You, Follow
Me had reached number 23 on the US
Billboard chart, and Then There Were
Three had gone gold in both the US and
Canada. and Phil Collins&#39;s marriage had
fallen apart. 40 years of he said, she
says have blurred the details of what
exactly happened. Before leaving on
tour, Bertelli has said she had
expressed to her husband that she felt
like she wasn&#39;t going to be able to cope
with him being away for so long in their
sorry home with two young children and
her friends and family in Vancouver.
Collins remembers it more as a threat.
If you go, I won&#39;t be here when you get
back. Famously, Collins points to
Bertelli&#39;s affair with the guy he&#39;d
employed to paint the house as their
marriage&#39;s end point. Bertelli contends
that in her mind the marriage was over
way before that, that his neglect,
temper, and his own alleged infidelities
had driven her away. And indeed, one
cannot fathom just how much your wife
has grown to resent you when you&#39;re on
different continents for months at a
time. When the tour ended, Bertelli took
the kids back to Vancouver for
Christmas. Collins followed his wife in
an attempt to save his marriage, intent
on living in Canada if that was what it
would take to win her back. As such, he
told his bandmates that functionally he
was out of Genesis, being that the
10-hour commute to band practice would
not be tenable, but fearing they might
lose another frontman, Banks Rutherford,
and band manager Tony Smith instead
allowed him some compassionate leave to
sort his life out. I was on the edge and
wondering about leaving Phil, so I hoped
space would help me decide.
Unfortunately, time is the one thing he
wouldn&#39;t give me. He&#39;d call constantly
and when I would answer, instantly start
raging, calling me names, telling me to
come home. He turned up unexpectedly a
couple of times. He didn&#39;t realize he
was driving me further away. The last
time we were together, he booked us into
a lovely hotel in Vancouver and tried to
persuade me to come home, but it was too
late. In the end, Colin spent 4 months
in Canada before realizing his efforts
were for it was over. As he returned to
England, he couldn&#39;t just go back to
work to numb the hurt. Genesis had taken
a year off for the first time ever.
Banks and Rutherford were in Sweden
taking this hiatus to work on solar
records at ABBA&#39;s Polar Studios.
Instead, he was left to either stare at
the walls of his newly refurbished empty
sorry home or spend his time at the
local pub. Therefore, as a way of
channeling his emotions, he started
writing songs about his situation. He
demoed these by converting his house&#39;s
master bedroom into a home studio with
an eight track tape machine, Profit 5
synthesizer, piano, and Roland&#39;s CR78
drum machine. Songs like the roof is
leaking, I missed again, and the more
pointed if leaving me is easy would be
molded by his downbeat, meditative mood.
I miss you.
While composing these songs, most of the
time Collins would find a vocal melody
first and then notes would become words,
become sentences. Their intent and
meaning mostly subconscious, but almost
always about his wife.
and your words.
Collins didn&#39;t just make his own music
during this time. During the recording
of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Brian
Enino had contributed his trademark
electronic treatments to a couple of
tracks. The halls

as well as becoming a frequent
collaborator within the British art rock
inner circle. So in 1979 he supplied
beats for Robert Frip, former bandmate
Peter Gabriel and folk jazz rocker John
There are always silences.
In the latter, he found a co-conspirator
in romantic anguish. Martin, too, was
going through a particularly bitter
divorce. As such, much of his
emotionally raw 1980 album, Grace and
Danger, was recorded in Collins&#39;s
bedroom. in between the two men making
angry drunken phone calls to their exes.
With John, it was very well was far more
intense because we were both involved in
the breakup of our particular marriages
with the consequent frictions ultimately
providing both our albums with the main
lyrical thrust. First, I noticed that
John was in something of a bad shape and
I offered moral support by inviting him
to stay here in the house where we
recorded the basic tracks for Grace.
Actually, we ended up offering each
other incredible moral support. When I
was being shaken up, he&#39;d helped me out
of my particular slump and vice versa.
When Genesis reconvened in the second
half of 1979, Collins for the first time
had a bevy of songs to submit. Playing
the Fredbear home demos to his
bandmates, a couple were snatched up for
their next album, 1980s Juke.
Misunderstanding would end up its third
single and number one in Canada and was

a reflection on all he had lost over the
last year.
After completing the album, Collins was
given the job to drive down to London
and play Juke to the head of their US
label Atlantic, the legendary record
producer Armet Etican. After listening
to the album with some drinks, he asked
Collins how he was, how the looming
divorce was going, what he&#39;d been doing
to stay sane. Collins could answer all
these questions with the demo cassette
he kept in his car tape deck, so played
him these rudimentary heartbroken songs.
Ertan was particularly impressed by an
ominous slow burner built on simple
synth chords and an amling drum machine
beat, a track that his bandmates had
dismissed. However, when the man who
discovered Artha Franklin and Otus
Reading thinks you have a hit on your
hands, you take notice.
What is instantly striking about In the
Air Tonight is its drum machine beat, a
ceaseless hollow mechanized shuffle.
After their visit to Japan at the end of
1978, the members of Genesis were each
gifted a CR78 drum machine from
electronics company Roland. Collins
initially dismissed the offer. As a
drummer, why would he ever need one? It
was only after he started writing that
he understood its utility as both a
metronome and so he wouldn&#39;t have to go
to the effort of mking up live drums in
his bedroom. But the robot filling in is
essential to the pitch black mood of In
the Air Tonight.
The whole thing was set up by this
really the mood of this drum machine.
For me, when you hear that,
you couldn&#39;t possibly replace that with
real drums. You know, people say, &#34;Why
do you use drum machine?&#34; You know, when
you&#39;re a drummer. And it&#39;s just that
sometimes drum machines give you things
that it&#39;s the atmosphere. It&#39;s
relentless. Doesn&#39;t move. A drummer
would get bored playing anything like
this. You put don&#39;t but don&#39;t. And it
would ruin the the the sort of
the relentlessness of it.
The song is an exercise in dynamics.
Much of Genesis&#39;s early work had various
ambitious elements fighting to be hurt.
In the air tonight is the opposite. It&#39;s
mostly negative space.
This is of course why when the real
flesh and blood drums thunder in, it&#39;s
so impactful. They burst through the
Colin&#39;s original demo doesn&#39;t have the
drum break, nor the increase in
intensity after the line.
It wasn&#39;t until we started recording the
songs with Hugh Padum for Face Value in
late 1980 that the real drums were added
and that especially battering tone was
seized upon. I could
Collins had previously worked with
Padium when he drumed on Peter Gabriel&#39;s
third self-titled album known as Melt
where on the track Intruder, Gabriel
tked Collins to create a drum beat
without symbols.
At the same time, Townhouse Studio 2,
where they were recording, had a brand
new SSL desk with cuttingedge filtering
and compression technology. When Collins
was tuning up, Padum had pressed the
reverse talkback button, and Phil&#39;s
practice hits took on an impressive
weight, creating what would become his
trademark drum sound.
The whole essence of the sound is the
compression of it, which makes it sound
really fat. And then the second that
there is a low in the sound, the gate
just shuts it off. The fact that the
drums were in a very live room. When you
compress a sound in a live room, it
brings up all the background noise and
the echo in the room. When you compress
a drum sound in a live room like that,
it makes it just sound much bigger. And
it makes the room sound bigger as well.
Therefore, when you go from something
sounding big to nothing, you get this
feeling of massive contrast. That is the
whole essence of why the sound was so
interesting because it is going from all
to nothing in milliseconds.
This gated reverb process was repeated
for in the air tonight.
Furthermore, the badum
doom dum was a late addition and a
suggestion from Etigan. His belief was
that without that seismic fill, no one
would know how to dance to the last part
of the song. Without the lead in, no one
would know where the first beat of the
bar is. It also acts as a release of
tension both in the song, but also
metaphorically.
you and me.
After going to Vancouver and trying to
reason with her over the phone, his
songs were his last attempt to
communicate his hurt to his soon-to-be
ex-wife, though pass through his usual
subconscious spontaneity.
Though in the air tonight might seem to
have a storyline. The drowning, the
remembrances, the lies.

Top of the Pops during the 70s, Phil
Collins would appear on the nation&#39;s
favorite music show and elevate the song
significantly.
Wearing the same kind of white Converse
that he was married in, and with a
conspicuous can of paint on his
makeshift keyboard stand, he seemed to
be sending psychic knives directly to
his now ex-wife. Not that Collins saw it
that way.
The Top of the Pops performance has
become one of those myths. I wasn&#39;t a
singer yet or didn&#39;t feel like one. And
I didn&#39;t want to just stand there. So,
we decided I&#39;d sit and play keyboards.
But what are we going to put the
keyboards on? A keyboard stand looks
ponyy. So, we decided on a workmate.
Then there was the drum machine. Where
are we going to put that? put it on a
tea chest. Tea chest. Workmate. During
rehearsal, more and more things got
added, and one was a paint pot. The
ex-wife saw it and thought it was
because she went out with a decorator.
She saw it and felt guilty, but
honestly, it was the farthest thing from
my mind.
In the air tonight, eventually managed
to get to number two in the UK. Denied
the top spot by John Lennon&#39;s woman. The
nation still in mourning.
Face Value was released in February
1981. While Collins had stuck with
Atlantic for the US release of his solo
work, he signed to Virgin Records in the
UK rather than Genesis Home Charisma.
This was to escape the associations with
progressive rock of his band&#39;s label
onto something quite the opposite. the
label that had sired the Sex Pistols,
never mind the bollocks, onto an
unsuspecting world. The fact that Face
Value went platinum within its first
three months also arguably helped save
the label, who was struggling after some
poor investments in the late &#39;7s. Phil
Collins ended up selling a lot of
records in the 1980s. As much as the
album&#39;s other singles, I Missed Again
and If Leaving Me is Easy, didn&#39;t do as
well as In the Air Tonight, merely top
20 hits.
this again. I think I missed again.
But I hide my feelings.
over the decade, Face Value spent 270
weeks in the UK charts, i.e. half of the
80s. Considering how instantly
successful Colin&#39;s solo career was, his
bandmates in Genesis were fearful that
they might again have to find another
frontman. Our most difficult moment
could have been when Face Value was such
a massive success. We were all writing
Abiab at the time. Face Value goes in at
29 and Mike and I think pretty good. The
next week it&#39;s number two and you think,
&#34;Oh shit.&#34; No matter how strong your
friendship, there is rivalry, too. You
feel he&#39;s transcended the band and you
wonder what effect it&#39;s going to have.
But I think we could take it because we
were 30ish by then. Anyway, we carried
on joking about how short he is, and
that diffused it completely. In between
Abacab and a self-titled album from
Genesis, Phil Collins released Hello, I
Must Be Going. If Face Value was the
breakup album, Hello was the divorce
album. Opener I don&#39;t care anymore,
distilling the sentiment of the drawn
out lawyerfilled process of dividing
marital assets into five minutes of
pounding rage.
But despite moving on with another
relationship, getting married again in
1984, this would not be the last time
Phil Collins released a song inspired by
Andrea Bertterelli. Against All Odds
came about as he sketched out the songs
from Face Value, originally titled How
Can You Just Sit There,
but he felt it was a B-side at best
compared to the other highquality
ballads on his debut.
Then in 1983, Taylor Hackford, director
of An Officer and a Gentleman, came
knocking, asking for a new Phil Collins
ballad for his modern remake of 40s
noir, Out of the Past. As Collins was,
as usual, on tour, he buffed up this old
demo with the chorus now featuring the
film&#39;s title. Won&#39;t you come back to me
against all odds and that&#39;s a chance
I&#39;ve got to take.
It was written at the height of my

song. Against all odds spins down how it
feels to be brokenhearted.
And it&#39;s a big vocal, impactful, raw,
real. I don&#39;t remember having the pain
and misery coursing through me as I
stood in the vocal booth, but I must
have drawn it from somewhere. That&#39;s
what the song needed, so I went for it.
Take a good look at me.
Despite originally being written in
1979, Against All Odds was nominated for
best original song at the 1985 Oscars,
losing out to Stevie Wonders I Just
Called to Say I Love You from The Woman
in Red.
I love you. Additionally, the

according to Collins, in part about
Though by the time it was a hit, he had
been remarried for two years.
Alongside his Genesis and solo career,
Collins still had time to collaborate
both as a drummer and producer. In the
early 80s, he worked with Robert Plant,
Eric Clapton, Adam Ant again with John

had employed the services of the Phoenix

but it&#39;s mine.
And so when co-lead singer of EWF,
Philip Bailey, needed a producer for his
1984 album Chinese Wool, Collins was his
man. Their gated reverb snare rocketed
soul rock duet Easy Lover was an
additional Collins mega hit.
And when Boomtown rats Bob Gelof and
Ultraox&#39;s Midure wanted a famous drummer
to play on their 1984 Christmas themed
charity single, Collins was the only
name that came to mind.
By this point, Phil Collins was
inescapable. Not including Genesis, he
sold 120 million albums worldwide during
the decade. His 1985 album, No Jacket
Required, going 12 times platinum in the
US. Sure, there were many, many Airways

He was also the only musician to play
both the London and Philadelphia halves
of Live Aid, traveling by Concord, so
neither time zone went without hearing
him sing in the air tonight. And that
was as well as playing with Sting, Eric
Clapton, and the disastrous Led Zeppelin
reunion. Of course, Jesus knew him. He&#39;d
have to be living under a rock not to.

Phil Collins was never cool. Unlike
other multi-million selling pop stars in
the 1980s, he never really courted the
teenage market. He was a divorced dad in
his 30s, and simply he was not Prince
nor Madonna. Critics were less than
kind, attacking his music, him
constantly talking about his divorce and
the way he looked. Despite having been
in the music business for over a decade
by this point, he bruised easily, took
these comments personally, and regularly
wrote into publications to defend
himself after bad reviews or being used
as an unfair punchline. Journalist Julie
Burchill once described him as the
ugliest man since George Orwell. I had
to go out and find a picture of him. He
wasn&#39;t particularly ugly, actually. On
the next single, there was a line
&#34;Don&#39;t take my pictures.&#34;
And this time, she wrote, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t
put his picture on the wall. It would
scare the cat.&#34; It&#39;s a laugh now, but at
the time I was so pissed off that it had
nothing to do with the music. I&#39;m
learning to turn my back on that kind of
thing. But even so, if it&#39;s there, I
still have to read it. A particular
angle that many critics went in on was
comparisons to Peter Gabriel&#39;s parallel
solo career. Collins had written a bunch
of credible yet sppy blue-eyed soul
ballads while cool artful Gabriel had
collaborated with Kate Bush was pushing
Prague pop to strange new places and
created a high-selling masterwork in
1986&#39;s so the imagined rivalry was
further stoked in the summer of 86 when
Peter Gabriel&#39;s sledgehammer dethroned
invisible touch from the top of the
Billboard Hot 100.
Plus, it can&#39;t help but sting that a
delusional yepy psychopath prefers your
work with Genesis. Been a big Genesis
fan ever since the release of their 1980
album, Duke.
Before that, I really didn&#39;t understand
any of their work. It&#39;s too artsy. And
as much as he was the bane of retail
workers during the Thatcher era, the
British backlash against Collins didn&#39;t
truly hit until the &#39;9s. Partly due to a
couple of sketchy tabloid stories that
have been morphed by public opinion into
fact, that he&#39;s a tax evading Tory, and
that he ended his second marriage via
facts. The former made NHS workers stop
buying his records in disgust, and the
latter undercut his appeal as a
sensitive ballader. According to
Collins, both were misunderstandings
taken out of context with few wanting to
listen to both sides of the story.
Another rumor repeated as fact during
the 90s was the truth behind In the Air
Tonight. Supposedly, Collins witnessed a
man drowning his wife, but didn&#39;t call
the police.
Instead, he sent this man front row
tickets to his concert. And as he began
singing in there tonight for the first
time ever, he put a spotlight on the man
exposing his crime.
And this confusing, clearly false story
or a variation of which was told and
retold so often on early internet music
discussion boards that Eminem referenced
it in Stan
about that guy who could have saved that
other guy from drowning but didn&#39;t. Then
Bill saw it all. at it. Zoe found him.
But part of the reassessment of Phil
Collins and his work is down to how
beloved he is by US R&amp;amp;B and hip-hop
acts. Because of his signature drum
sound and emotive voice, Collins is
regularly sampled. See, I&#39;m seeing
nothing but my dreams coming true. While
I&#39;m staring at the world through my rear

world was going into doubt.
That&#39;s crazy.
We got better things to do with our

Still, Collins was surprised but
heartened by this appreciation. Let&#39;s
face it, we all think black R&amp;amp;B artists
know what they&#39;re talking about. The
first time I was aware of it was when I
watched a documentary on IC Tea. This
smug UK journalist looking at his record
collection said, &#34;What&#39;s with all the
Phil Collins stuff?&#34; He said, &#34;Don&#39;t

Over the last 25 years, Phil Collins has
retired several times. his body battered
and him left partially deaf from a
lifetime of doing what he loves, hitting
drums really hard. But before then, he
won an Oscar for You&#39;ll Be in My Heart
from Disney&#39;s Tarzan,
pissed off the creators of South Park,
and soundtrack the best chocolate advert
He is a contradiction. A former art rock
darling who worked with Eno, Frip, and
Gabriel and released a seriously
avanguard debut single. Yet, he sold
millions of records became a figure of
ridicule. And that same oddball single
is universally beloved. An evergreen
track to air drum to in your car. Null
Gallagher once said, &#34;Just because you
sell lots of records, it doesn&#39;t mean to
say you&#39;re any good.&#34; Look at Phil
Collins. But while Oasis 2 have sold a
lot of records, I think it&#39;s in the air
tonight that will live forever.
