Okay, calm down.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wanted to just really quickly talk
about the journalists who were have been
murdered. Katie, I mean, especially Anna
Al Sharief. 28 years old. 28 years old,
you know? I mean, to think of how young
that is and how horrific it is that
Israel smeared this young man as a Hamas
operative. And even if he was, nothing
justifies extrajudicial murder.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s what courts are for. Okay, so all
of this is sick. Even if you&#39;re running
on the premise that someone equals Hamas
equals justified murder, that is sick.
But let&#39;s just look at Annal Sharif.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What a long con, right? Because this man
graduated from Gaza City&#39;s Alaka
University with a mass communication
degree. He specialized in radio and
television in college. Then he
volunteered for a media network. And
then he won best young journalist in
Gaza in 2018 for his amazing diligent
reporting on the ground. This was a man
who dedicated his entire adult life to
investigative journalism and reporting
even before he got the job with Alazer.
So you know and it&#39;s the same with
Ismile Oul. I mean, he obtained a
bachelor&#39;s degree in journalism at the
Islamic University of Gaza. And then he
studied media and journalism. He was 27.
27 years old. I mean, just wrap your
mind around that. Ham Shabbat was 23.
23 years old. I mean, it&#39;s just sick.
It&#39;s sick that you could have press
outlets repeating,
regurgitating IDF press releases about
these young heroic men being Hamas
operatives.
How dare you? How dare you? Where is the
outrage? Where is the outcry? You know,
these Western journalists will never
even fathom what heroism is, what
selflessness is, because journalists in
Gaza are the bravest human beings alive.
They know that their work is a death
sentence because Israel openly hunts
them and threatens to kill them. But
they do it out of duty to their people.
Not only out of duty to their people,
but out of defiance to the world that
ignores their suffering, gaslights them,
denies their reality, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they do it regardless. And that&#39;s
something that I don&#39;t think anyone can
really wrap their mind around. It&#39;s
unfathomable. It&#39;s incomprehensible. And
so if people like Clarissa Ward who
leave that Tik Tok and just think, &#34;Yep,
I did my part, checked a box,&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you will never understand.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Years into it, years into it,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; years into it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Um, you know, uh, it is also the
the rank hypocrisy of, um, like imagine
someone from a Muslim country calling,
um, BBC journalists mouthpieces for
state terror and then accusing them of
being bankrolled by terrorists, then
beginning to murder these journalists.
Like, do you think that the the media,
Western media would be okay with that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, it&#39;s the whole framework of the
the people who work for my enemy are
deemed enemy combatants. I mean, the
fact that, you know, people like me and
Chris Hedges and Lee Camp, we were all
considered people who could have their
entire body of work removed from the
internet because we were unsaavory
characters working for Russian media. I
mean, it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so funny. That&#39;s exactly what they&#39;d say
like the Russians are the communist, you
know, they&#39;re literally disappearing
people from the internets.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Disappearing people from the
internet. And I hate to even compare
that to what&#39;s going on in Palestine.
Obviously, there&#39;s no comparison at all,
but it&#39;s just the idea that Al Jazer
employs people and those people are
journalists and they are our colleagues,
but because it&#39;s Al Jazer. I mean, let&#39;s
not for let&#39;s not forget what even the
CIA and State Department did after 911.
They paid tens of millions, potentially
more than that, to decipher the the
Cryions and lower thirds of Alazer
because they were so concerned that it
was terrorist messaging. I mean, this is
how cartoonish it&#39;s become. Look at
France 24, BBC, Voice of America. Those
are all arguably, you know, all the
journalists working for those outlets,
not only are they statef funded and you
know, they could be called agents of the
state according to the same logic. But
those states are actually genocide. I
mean, these are the states committing
genocide, colonialism, imperialism, war,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? So, I mean, just by the same
logic, it is just absolutely insane and
horrific that anyone can co-sign to
this, you know? I mean, like two years
into this and the silence, the
egregious, deafening silence from all of
the journalists in the world about the
systematic slaughter of Palestinians who
work in media.
I can&#39;t wrap my mind around it, Katie.
The only thing I can rationalize is that
they don&#39;t think Palestinians are human,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They are bigots and racists and they are
so comfortable with their status that
they don&#39;t want to lose their job. You
know, times are tough, Katie. So, that
that letter sent out by the BBC with 200
200 BBC employees, I was very pleasantly
surprised. I just thought finally almost
two years into this, we finally have a
mass letter by BBC journalists signing
about how horrific it is that their
network is co-signing all this horrific
genocide propaganda. Well, consider my
shock when I opened the letter and it
was 200 anonymous anonymouses. I was
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#34;Yeah, wow. Really brave.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow. Really brave, guys. Really brave.
And look at the New York Times. The day
after five five reporters were bombed in
a journalist tent outside Alshiba
hospital. What did the what did the New
York Times say? They published an
article that said, &#34;What is Al Jazzer?
What is this this network that Israel
keeps targeting as a terrorist
mouthpiece? Let&#39;s find out.&#34; Well, the
network denies it, but let&#39;s really dig
in here. I mean, this is complicity.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, of course. manufacturing consent
for the systematic slaughter of your
colleagues,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Yeah. And Reuters putting in
Hamas, you know, uh, killed a
journalist, uh, Israel said was Hamas
operative. Like, you put that in the
headline. Like, don&#39;t you aren&#39;t
shouldn&#39;t you be better at being like
state synographers? Like, don&#39;t there&#39;s
an art to it. You want to be a little
subtle. You don&#39;t want to be that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Reuters and AP are supposed to be
like press wires. It&#39;s like, &#34;Okay, we
get it, but you&#39;re not just supposed to
literally reprint the IDF press release,
Reuters.&#34; Like, use some goddamn
discernment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Um, there&#39;s actually one a clip I
wanted to show um that features, I
think, a framing that we never see
before. I was actually really shocked
that CNN let this uh clip remain on air.
So, it&#39;s it&#39;s foreign Press Association
President Ian Williams being asked about
um the killing of Anasal Sharif and
whether he&#39;s Hamas. Um, and let&#39;s let&#39;s
take a listen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Association says it&#39;s outraged by the
targeted killings of journalists in
Gaza. Let&#39;s bring in Ian Williams, the
president of the association. Ian,
welcome to the program. As we&#39;ve noted,
we&#39;ve seen repeated calls uh for Western
journalists to be allowed into Gaza as
the war approaches its 2-year mark. Um
just talk about to tell our viewers why
that is so important to have Western
journalists there uh to observe what is
going on on the ground throughout the
war and what the reaction has been and
the justification when you reach out to
the Israeli government demanding as
Well, the one of the points is we should
trust Palestinian journalists as well,
but there&#39;s, you know, profound sort of
racism and the Israeli government has
basically said if you&#39;re Palestinian,
you&#39;re not to be trusted. Whereas I
think the foreign press, the press in
general are now beginning to learn that
whatever the Israeli government says has
to be taken with a 100 weight of salt
because there&#39;s, you know, it what they
say bears no relation to reality. And
they use key words like, you know, the
Hamas Ministry of Defense. Hamas
controls the place. And I mean the
Ministry of Health, uh, Hamas controls
the place. journalists. Uh, frankly, I
don&#39;t care whether Asharif was in Hamas
or not. We don&#39;t kill journalists for
being Republicans or Democrats or in
Britain Labor Party. Uh, Hamas is a
political organization as well as a
terrorist organization perhaps, but it&#39;s
not permissible to go killing people.
And this was the distinct uh change now
is the IDF actually boasted that this
was a targeted killing. And the reason
they&#39;re doing that is they&#39;re not
letting foreign journalists in. So
Palestinian journalists are the only
ones who are there, the only ones who
can tell what&#39;s happening there. And
what they&#39;re saying completely
contradicts what&#39;s coming from Israeli
spokesman in Israel and across the
world. Uh you know, it&#39;s quite clear.
They&#39;ve documented the ongoing massacres
and it&#39;s the Israelis don&#39;t like it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean by not caring whether
Anasal Sheriff was part of Hamas?
Because the Israelis uh have produced
what they say is evidence and have
long-standing
uh uh statements where they say he was
not only part of Hamas, but he was
leading a Hamas cell. In your view, that
doesn&#39;t make him fair game for Israeli
Well, first of all, I don&#39;t believe it.
He&#39;s been working 24 hours on
journalism. He doesn&#39;t have going He
doesn&#39;t have time to work in a cell on
the side. Second point is I basically
don&#39;t believe anything the Israeli
government says about this. They&#39;ve lied
and lied and lied. They buried a whole
medical team. I mean, by the way, before
I&#39;m going to keep playing this, but um
this woman, her name is um Banna
Goladraga, and she uh has pushed the uh
Hamas rape hoax a lot.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um you know, people could say that she
has blood on her hands.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, what what longstanding documents?
She said they produce longstanding
documents.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah. Can she I would
love to see that lady. This long st What
does that even mean? Longstanding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Longstanding documents. herbara talking
points are like fried in her brain. She
can&#39;t even like reach for the good has
borrowed talking points. So disgusting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;ve lied and lied and lied. They
buried a whole medical team after
denying it. They went and destroyed the
evidence. They bombed hospitals claiming
the Hamas facilities underneath which
weren&#39;t there. And the only way to con
conclusively disprove them was to let
foreign journalists in. and they won&#39;t
do that. So now they&#39;re basically saying
if foreign journalists are allowed in
now, I would I would make sure they
compose their wills before they go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These are two separate the IDF has no
compunction.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The these are two separate issues you
raise. I think the majority of
journalists around the world and I would
imagine a lot of our viewers would
support uh allowing Western journal
journalists into Gaza to see
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow, that is so big of you. What a what
a a principled person that you think
that they should allow Western
journalists in that is so brave. Wow.
You must have gone to journalism school
to to understand the power of journalism
so well because what an amazing thing to
say for themselves and report for
themselves what is happening in this
war. But when you say you don&#39;t believe
a word Israel is saying, you know,
there&#39;s been a lot of uh accusation
thrown at Israel for not producing
evidence to uh to confirm some of the
claims they&#39;ve made. If they then
produce evidence and you say, &#34;I don&#39;t
believe it.&#34; Where does that leave
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, also, what evidence are you
talking about? Like, it is absolutely
the right thing to do to assume Israel
lies by default. like you should never
believe it until not only should they
produce evidence but like it needs to be
cross-cheed because I don&#39;t believe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s again an inverse of reality. It&#39;s
like you should the dubiousness is on
Hamas instead of Israel. The notorious
pathologically lying nuclear armed state
committing genocide. Yeah, great
journalism.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t believe it. Where does that
leave things? Also, poor Israel. They&#39;ve
been accused of not having evidence.
Come on. How can you you&#39;re going to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; accuse of not having evidence about the
slaughtering 200 plus journalists and
their families. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. They&#39;re really in a bind. It&#39;s
really hard for them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, it leaves things. We work on the
balance of proof. Our job is to
challenge authority. The authority here
is denying access to independent
witnesses. Nobody else is allowed to go
into Gaza. International organizations
aren&#39;t allowed into Gaza. Journalists
aren&#39;t allowed into Gaza. Reuters, AP,
CNN, BBC are not allowed into Gaza. Now,
what does that give a sort of more than
a little hint that things are going on
there that the Israeli government
doesn&#39;t want you to know about or
doesn&#39;t want you to witness? What other
conclusion are you going to give? You
know, there&#39;s a presumption in favor of
Israel in a lot of this which is totally
unjustified after recent experience, I
think. Um, and
they they&#39;ve targeted journalists before
in the West Bank as well. By the way,
we&#39;re looking at Gaza, but uh,
journalists have been assaulted and
killed in in the West Bank as well for
witnessing what the settlers are doing,
let alone what the IDF is doing. So, I I
think we&#39;re really, you know, it&#39;s not
it it doesn&#39;t do Israel any great favors
for basically making everything they say
totally questionable.
All right, Ian Williams will have to
leave it there. Thank you so much for
the time. Uh, president of the Foreign
Press Association.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I bet she like cried after that or threw
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow, that was really heavy. That was
really heavy because it&#39;s just in the
face of nothing. The grasping at straws.
I mean, I just wish that he could have
just said, &#34;What was the evidence?&#34; Him
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; posing with Sinoir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. because there&#39;s a long list of
Israelis that have hung out with
Netanyahu and worked for Netanyahu and
interviewed Netanyahu and all the lunik
I mean it is so horrific. So all of
those journalists are completely fair
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to be extrajudicially assassinated along
with their families and hey you know if
you kill 500 people in the apartment
building but hey you were trying to get
that journalist who interviewed
Netanyahu one time. I mean where does
this end? I don&#39;t think that uh Biana
would be cool with that. Something tells
it&#39;s so disgusting.
