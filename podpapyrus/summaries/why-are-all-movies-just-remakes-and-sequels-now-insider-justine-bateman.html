My perception of you is that you must be
a Hollywood insider. You must know a lot
of people in Hollywood. I don&#39;t know if
that&#39;s accurate given that your acting
career is in the past, but my real
question is like what window can you
give into what it is like like what the
culture of Hollywood is is like in these
mob mentality respects.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, sure. Um, yeah, acting is in the
past, but I&#39;m I&#39;m, you know, been in the
business since I was 16 years old. Um
it&#39;s actually you&#39;re actually wind up in
a much better position when once you&#39;re
a screenwriter, director, producer
because you are um you are gathering
people into your film versus being
somebody who&#39;s you know auditioning to
be included. Um so yeah, I&#39;ve been in
the business since
1982. And yeah, I know a lot of people.
And one of the fun things about being in
the business this long is um the people
that were assistants when I was younger
um are, you know, running this and
running that. Um, that&#39;s a fun thing to
see, you know, or somebody who was like
a lower level uh agent or an agent&#39;s
assistant or a runner in the mail room
is now one of the partners. Um, so yeah,
I know a lot of people in the business,
you know, of course, and um, and I and I
love I love the entertainment business
and I love all the people that are
called to it. Um it&#39;s a very special
collection of people with you know from
from the executives to the crew um with
very specific with a very specific skill
set you know varying skill sets but um
very unique skill sets um
so yeah well I&#39;ll say here&#39;s what&#39;s
happened I&#39;ll give you the shorter
version of what&#39;s happened in the
business specific to what you just asked
Um, and I have an essay coming out in
tablet. Uh, they&#39;re doing a physical
magazine. Um, that&#39;s uh kind of talks
about that.
But the entertainment business was
established, I&#39;ll just say, you know,
specific to the film business was
established by people who were really
risktakers. like they&#39;re not only
willing to like essentially,
you know, recruit enough people to it&#39;s
like a small city to get a film done,
but and to create some sort of fanciful
story or reenact some real story or
something that wasn&#39;t there before. Just
create something out of nothing. But
you&#39;re also willing to um in most
situations, it&#39;s rare to not have this,
but you&#39;re willing to earn a living
where you&#39;re not sure how you&#39;re getting
the next check. So, it&#39;s a constant
you&#39;re you are a risk taker financially,
you&#39;re a risk taker emotionally,
creatively, everything. You have to be
that stopped. It&#39;s funny. I I went to
school late in life. So, uh I went I was
at UCLA from um 2012 to 2016. So, I was
like the I was the the bash right before
you were there. Um I at UCLA I said um
yeah, and I&#39;m really glad I wasn&#39;t there
during that shutdown time. I would have
been I would have been really sad about
that. Anyway, we can get into education
later, but um in entertainment
something what happened I believe about,
you know, well, there&#39;s other things and
not to make this too long of an answer,
but um and I&#39;ve written essays about
this, how the the tech companies, you
know, once they decided to use our work
for their as content for their websites,
they they changed a lot of things. um
the way work is treated, the way work is
spoken about. They don&#39;t call them films
and series. They call them they just
call it content because it&#39;s just stuff
for their shelves really. Um they uh
change the financial ecosystem in in a
lot of ways that are extremely
detrimental to um the filmmakers and the
crew and everybody involved. Um, but one
of the things that happened to the film
is for a couple reasons. They lost their
north star. They lost their northstar of
outstanding work.
Meaning that was always the goal before
and there was room for all kinds of
work. There were be films and so TV
series, but like the goal was this
excellence. you wanted to be associated
with something really good and not just
something that like lasted beyond this
era. Um, and it was shameful to do
something for money and sometimes you
had to, but it was you didn&#39;t feel good
about it. And what happened like 10
years ago is you had this streaming
um situation. you had a lot of studio
executives
chasing kind of chasing after them, not
wanting to be made to look like chumps
financially. Um, so they started
following that business model that
really screwed things up. Um, and they
also started following that north star
in as in as far as how they relate to
the work.
the studios started looking at the films
and TV series just as content and
started making there&#39;s exceptions to
this of course there have been some good
work over the last 10 years but the
focus became volume content
and I can tell you I watched four films
in the last three days
one of them was good the other three big
stars lots of money I know
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mhm. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; absolutely terrible phoned in
performances by actors who are good
actors. M
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bad script,
bad direction, phoned in direction,
passible uh production values, and like
if you&#39;re really called to this and
you&#39;re gifted at this and this is this
is where you&#39;re supposed to be and what
you&#39;re supposed to do, it would rip you
up inside to turn in something like that
where it just seemed like it&#39;s not like
you swung for the fences and you didn&#39;t
really make it, but you tried.
No, this was like didn&#39;t it looked like
you were paid to not care. H
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so
and sorry the component that relates to
what we were talking about that
oppression the shutdown
they started through all of that
behaving a lot more like a corporation
than anything to do with making films
and series in that they were very much
reacting to the loudest 1,000 people on
social media who are committed to being
angry about anything.
Put a plate of pudding in front of them,
they&#39;re going to get mad about it.
Anything. And I think that is a lot of
like um intimacy through injury is what
I call it. Like you want connection with
people. And it&#39;s a lot faster to get
that connection through conflict than it
is through,
you know, developing a friendship or
something like that.
So they started
reacting to that and they went into this
fear mode.
Um, and you saw a lot of reboots, a lot
of remakes, a lot of sequels, a lot of,
you know, uh, creative fear and
financial fear and like and that was it.
So the even the stuff that&#39;s that is
that has been good over the last you
know decade has had very difficult for
the most part difficult time getting an
audience not had the not had the support
or the promotion that&#39;s necessary. Um
yeah and it&#39;s like it&#39;s like you&#39;re in
this giant Costco of
stuff and you have to like paw through
it to find the actual films and the
actual series. Um because yeah like
there&#39;s no one at the helm anymore.
There&#39;s no you know you also god I could
go on and on about it. You got rid of
the the critics really. Uh there aren&#39;t
really many critics anymore. There are
people that&#39;ll do like summaries of some
project that was released. Sometimes
you&#39;ll find some good critics like
accidental critics by I&#39;ve read some you
know sort of film bloggers that really
watched the film really know the history
of film making and could see where the
influences were and what the metaphors
were and things like that but uh gosh I
don&#39;t really see that mainstream much at
all. Yeah, I mean I um
I grew up like going to the movie
theaters like multiple times a month
with my family. It was like a family
thing. And uh I you know as as one gets
older I always ask myself do I think
that there was a golden era just because
it&#39;s when I happen to be a kid and a
teenager and I&#39;m looking through at the
past through rosecolored glasses or is
it actually the case that there was a
golden era and that era has passed? I
think about this with music too and you
know I go back and listen to music from
the 60s and 70s and it kind of feels
like a golden era um even though I
didn&#39;t grow up with that music. So that
makes me feel that maybe I&#39;m being
actually I am being kind of objective
when I say that like the &#39;9s and 2000s
was a a golden era for just really good
films. There was like a lot of good
films being made high quality. Some of
them were mass appeal, some of them were
niche appeal, but there was just really
good storytelling um that was happening.
And I agree with you. It&#39;s not that that
doesn&#39;t happen today, but it does seem
like it happens at onethird the rate it
did uh a few decades ago.
