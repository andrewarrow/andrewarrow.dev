You&#39;ll all remember that we told you the
deputy attorney general, Todd Blanch,
sat for two days of interviews with
Galain Maxwell in a proper session. The
deputy attorney general and the DOJ has
now released the full transcripts, or at
least what they say are the full
transcripts of their conversation. And
you will be absolutely shocked to know
that Galain Maxwell doesn&#39;t implicate
Donald Trump, doesn&#39;t implicate anybody
powerful at all. Prince Andrew did
nothing wrong. Bill Gates did nothing
wrong. Jeffrey Epste was a simple money
manager. By the way, to the extent that
anyone did anything wrong, it was
Jeffrey Epstein. And it was, of course,
after Gain Maxwell was ever in the
picture. Maxwell herself did nothing
wrong. Nobody did anything wrong. And by
the way, she would like her pardon
immediately. She did say a few
interesting things. Uh to the extent
that we give credence at all, let&#39;s keep
in mind every claim that she makes needs
to be deeply scrutinized and I will get
into them. Let&#39;s go to the first part,
shall we? Let&#39;s put it up here on the
screen. This is the first most important
section uh where Maxwell claims uh that
she does not believe that Epstein quote
died by suicide. She says quote I do not
believe he died by suicide. And uh Todd
Blanch goes do you believe that? Do you
have any speculation or view who killed
him? She says no I don&#39;t. He continues I
asked that because if you don&#39;t believe
that and there&#39;s any truth for the
allegation of blackmail, etc. Did he
have any reason for people to hate him?
Why would somebody kill him in prison?
And she says, and this is something I
keep emphasizing. People are like, how
could they get somebody to kill him?
Listen to her answer. In prison where I
am, they will kill you or they will pay,
somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you
for $25 worth of commissary. That&#39;s
about the going rate for a hit with a
lock today. That is an important thing
to underscore because he was in, you
know, MCC. People keep asking, they&#39;re
like, who killed him? It&#39;s like, it&#39;s
obviously another prisoner. These guys
kill each other over literally 25 cent
gambling debts to maintain respect. So
the idea that it would be difficult for
somebody to kill him or especially to
strangle him to death is like so that is
the most plausible scenario. It&#39;s far
more plausible than that he killed
himself. Anyway, the one piece of sense
that Golain was saying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but even in that guess who she doesn&#39;t
implicate of course the Trump
administration not just that I mean
anybody anyone powerful right and
obviously it was the first Trump
administration when Jeffrey Epstein died
however that unfolded and so she&#39;s very
careful to you know I don&#39;t think he
killed himself but it was just some you
know prison beef is probably what
happened nobody powerful was involved
don&#39;t worry you can trust me
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this whole thing is like a joke let&#39;s go
to the next part here this is her
angling for her pardon Uh, shall we?
Quote, I never saw the president in any
type of massage setting. I never
witnessed the president in any
inappropriate setting in any way. The
president was never inappropriate with
anybody in all the times I was with him.
He was a gentleman in all respects. And
she even says uh that by the way, I just
want to say uh that I find it so
impressive that he was able to get
himself elected president of the United
States. Of course, I&#39;m sure those are
just uh you know, very normal feelings,
right? Um, okay. Now, let me just again
lay out how much of her testimony or
whatever her her in her profer session
is just a provable lie. And this is the
easiest one for me to point out. Let&#39;s
put it up here on the screen. She told
Todd Blanch directly that she built all
of Epstein&#39;s houses. And the idea that
there are cameras in them is
preposterous. So, here is the exact
transcript. From what you know, you do
not believe a camera exists or a video
camera exists or a camera that takes
pictures inside any of his residences?
Galain Maxwell. Correct. Here is a
picture from Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s bedroom
with a mounted surveillance camera above
his bed. There are many other photos of
surveillance cameras all over the 77th
Street mansion. There are FBI
acknowledgments that during the raids of
his uh houses that they found cameras
apparently everywhere. Like this is the
part where Todd Blanch doesn&#39;t even push
back in any way. He&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, so
you&#39;re telling me there&#39;s no cameras?&#34;
Okay. And she&#39;s she goes on this whole
long spiel. She&#39;s like, &#34;I built those
houses from ground to, you know, from
floor to ceiling. I know every inch of
them and the wiring. There&#39;s no cameras
anywhere.&#34; And he&#39;s not sitting there
being like, &#34;Well, what about this photo
of a camera?&#34; Like it&#39;s like what? You
know, I&#39;m just an idiot. I&#39;m literally
an idiot on YouTube who&#39;s read as much
as I can about the Epstein case. And
immediately I&#39;m like, what are you
talking about here? Here&#39;s 10 photos of
cameras in there. So, did those cameras
show up after you built the houses? If
they did, who put them in there? What
was the name of the house manager? Who
were the employees who would have known
how to do something like that? What was
the subcontracting firm because you
claimed to run all of his finances and
know every inch of the desk? So many of
the things that she said were total
lies. Even worse, the way she tries to
minimize everything that happened. It&#39;s
sickening. Like I read all 400 pages of
this lady&#39;s testimony at every end.
She&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, that was Jeffrey. Um,
it was after I departed.&#34; Or, &#34;I never
saw anything wrong.&#34; Like every, &#34;Oh,
Prince Andrew, I met him through Diana&#39;s
friend, and I don&#39;t wish to speak ill of
her, but Andrew, he&#39;s so British. He
would never do anything like that.&#34; And
it&#39;s like for Andrew, for Bill Gates,
for Leon Black, for Les Wexner, it&#39;s
like the most explanation that
does not even pass a remote smell test.
Blanch lets her get away with it. And
the worst part is this will probably use
is already being used by the Epstein
defenders is look, see, she drove a
knife in the heart of uh all of the
Epstein conspirac. Why would we listen
to this lady? This lady was charged with
perjury in 2020 for lying in a
deposition. Now, to be fair, the
prosecution ended up dropping the
perjury uh for her sentencing because
she&#39;d already been convicted. The
broader charge was going to send her for
prison for 20 years. Like, open and
shut, decent enough proof that she has
lied under oath for a deposition.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not only that, like let&#39;s just be really
clear about the context here. This is a
woman who wants
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; she&#39;s trying to get out and she&#39;s trying
to project, not just to Trump, but to
anyone powerful that you&#39;re not going to
have a problem with me. I&#39;m going to
keep my mouth shut. your secrets are
safe with me. I&#39;m going to be no issue.
I&#39;m not going to implicate anyone. I&#39;m
going to downplay this thing. We can all
just move on. I mean, that&#39;s the point
of this. And so, even if she wasn&#39;t like
a proven liar, which obviously she is,
you have to think about what are her
motivations. Obviously, she&#39;s not going
to come forward, oh yeah, I saw Trump
doing X and Y and Z. Oh yeah, he&#39;s
totally Epstein was totally, you know,
an intel agent. Oh, yeah. There were,
you know, cameras everywhere. Because
the minute you acknowledge there are
cameras everywhere too that again
confirms there&#39;s a lot of information
out there that we have never been given
access to. So that&#39;s why the camera
piece is important and it is one of the
most easily disprovable pieces. I mean,
didn&#39;t we get that information not only
from a lot of witnesses who saw such
things? But there was also when
Epstein&#39;s mansion on the Upper East Side
was, you know, raided by law
enforcement, they also didn&#39;t, weren&#39;t
they part of, you know, talking about
the cameras that were there like this,
they say it directly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is there&#39;s, you know, this is
proven fact. This is not speculation.
This is not conspiracy theory, etc. So,
it speaks to her credibility and the
motivations that she has in this whole
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely. Let&#39;s go to the next part,
please. Because, you know, just to
continue to give you guys a flavor of
what we&#39;re all dealing with. This is
Maxwell. I never saw a single masseuse
ever look unhappy or not come back or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, that&#39;s what we were dealing with.
So, she&#39;s like, so based on my
observation, I don&#39;t This is classic. I
don&#39;t think that if you were being
raped, as he&#39;s now like this prolific, I
just I can&#39;t even imagine why you would
return. All right. So, it&#39;s like, you
know, when battered women, this is the
justification that people make about
battered women. They&#39;re like, &#34;Well, if
they wanted to leave so bad, they would
just leave.&#34; I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, yeah. It&#39;s
that simple.&#34; Okay. Talk to any cop
who&#39;s ever had to go to a domestic
violence call and some lady has her face
broken and she&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, we didn&#39;t do
anything wrong. Maybe there&#39;s a bigger
context and some power dynamic and money
exchange and blackmail or whatever which
is keeping people there.&#34; Just my
opinion. My opinion. Well, and the the
testimony is that um I mean dozens of
girls down in Florida, in particular in
Palm Beach that she would intentionally
go to rough areas of town where you had,
you know, girls from troubled homes who
were in very difficult situations. They
were desperate, you know. I mean, she
prayed on people who had already been
abused um who were desperate for
Virginia Gay being a perfect example of
that, you know, um as a as a teenager,
as a young teen at Mara Lago. and she
recognized this vulnerability and those
would be the girls that she would go
after and pray along.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And and you know, of course to her, she
never did anything. She she didn&#39;t even
look at an underage person while she was
at ever worked for I&#39;m serious. That&#39;s
that&#39;s the way that she talks in all of
her testimony.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember Trump even acknowledged that
Virginia Gay was like stolen from him by
Galain and and Jeffrey Epstein.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. All right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When she was what, 16?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I believe so. Uh let&#39;s go to the
next one. Uh this is another one. She he
asks, you know, do you have any reason
to think that your that Epstein was part
of Mossad or the CIA or any intelligence
agency? She says, quote, I think it&#39;s
because if it were true, then
Epstein would have bragged about it to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or tried to play it off and tried to be
cool about it. And so, because he was
never cool about it and didn&#39;t brag
about it to her that she thinks that
it&#39;s all wrong. Now let&#39;s keep that in
context this part specifically for the
next which remains the central question
of the entire Epstein mythology which is
how did this guy make all of his money
here is Maxwell&#39;s explanation on the
type of services that he provided for
less Wexner and Leon Black quote let&#39;s
say you had a billion dollars to invest
so would you would you know in people&#39;s
normal investment portfolios you would
have you know some T-bonds and this and
that but Epstein&#39;s strategies would be
much more sophisticated
So again, we are to believe that the
college dropout nonacredited investor
Jeffrey Epstein had quote sophisticated
strategies that were only accessible to
him and not to the richest and most
powerful people in the world. There are
richest, most powerful people in the
world who use investment advisors of all
kinds. Goldman Sachs and they don&#39;t need
to deal with Epstein. Why do they need
to deal with the Jpstein company? All
right, Goldman and all those other
people can get you into venture capital
as an LP or any of that and they can
return on your portfolio for between 15
and 20% per year or you could just
invest it in the S&amp;amp;P 500 and still get a
decent enough deal. This does not pass
the smell test at all. Leon Black, one
of the most legendary investment
adviserss of all time, had just had to
use Epstein and not didn&#39;t have to use
his own money. That&#39;s why I paid him
$170 million. Again, Todd Blanch, no
explanation. He doesn&#39;t challenge her.
He&#39;s like, &#34;Well, exactly what were the
sophistic strategies?&#34; She goes, &#34;He was
just a whiz at math.&#34; What? No. You
know, no. This stuff is ridiculous.
Well, if that if that were true, all of
the people at the Harvard math
department who he was constantly
cultivating or MIT or any of them, they
would all be billionaires and be filthy
rich. If that&#39;s not the case, is it? So,
it&#39;s just that is the part where the
explanation on everything is anodine.
Everything is just, oh, uh, he made his
money by being smart. He, nobody was
abused except by him. I&#39;ve learned about
that after his death. Of course, I
didn&#39;t know about any of it at the time.
Uh, everything we ever did was above
board. Every connection that he ever had
to quote intelligence or whatever is
quote because he would have
bragged to me about it. And I just
can&#39;t, you know, with the entire thing.
It really Todd Blanch just did a
horrible job. Like, he really just did
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, he did. He did a great job for what
his purposes were.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. But I mean for for transparent
purposes what he effectively did is
engineer it would be like a softball
interview is the example of it&#39;s like
when Republicans are in trouble or
Democrats are you know Republicans in
trouble and go on Fox and Democrats are
in trouble and go on MSNBC. What can
they be assured of? That when they&#39;re in
their interview that they will be asked
in the most anodine way without any
followup about what&#39;s happening so that
they can quote get on the record and get
ahead of it, but they can&#39;t actually
they don&#39;t actually have to answer any
of the specific questions and that&#39;s
effectively what has happened here. So,
it&#39;s just the whole thing is
preposterous and I just want people to
remember that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. A couple other things interesting
nuggets from there. She was asked about
her dad&#39;s ties to intel. And she
basically was like, &#34;Well, once you&#39;re,
you know, an intelligence agent, I don&#39;t
think you&#39;re ever really not an
intelligence agent.&#34; Was basically her
um her response there, which I thought
was kind of interesting. And then she
got asked about Epstein&#39;s relationship
with former Israeli Prime Minister Ahub
Barack. He&#39;s the one who met with
Epstein dozens of times. there&#39;s that
infamous picture of him like covering
with his face covered going into EP
Epstein&#39;s upper east side mansion and so
Blanch asked about that relationship and
if she knew what the nature of that
relationship was and she&#39;s just like no
I didn&#39;t know anything um have you know
very little memory of meeting him don&#39;t
know if he&#39;s with Epstein or I don&#39;t
remember I just know that I did see him
and I&#39;m trying struggling to remember
the context around it but if I if I&#39;m
sure it happened but it must have been
very brief because I don&#39;t have any
serious memory of it any like deep
memory of that So there you go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, that&#39;s uh what we&#39;re all dealing
with. Uh let&#39;s just put B7, please up on
the screen just to give people an idea.
All the Epstein files given to Congress
are apparently already public.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, got it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Roan is sounding off in this piece, by
the way. I mean, he&#39;s really been um
leading the charge. Uh apparently only
3% according to him of the documents
given to the oversight committee are
new. He says the rest are already in the
public domain. Less than 1% of the files
have been released. DOJ is stonewalling
the survivors deserve justice. The
public deserves transparency.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Got it. And uh finally, just in
terms of the protection, B7, please. Uh
we can show everybody here. Uh what do
we have? Uh the inmate at Galain
Maxwell&#39;s new prison was apparently
transferred to a grim lockup after
slamming Galain in an interview. So h
name was Julie Powell. She was serving
just one year for theft. She was
actually removed after blasting Maxwell,
quote, as disgusting with a British
paper earlier this month. Uh according
to her lawyer, the prison warden called
her into her office and said that she
was being moved immediately because
quote uh because that she had given an
unauthorized interview and she literally
quote only decided to speak up because
one of her family members was actually a
victim of sex trafficking and she didn&#39;t
want to be in the same prison as
somebody who was had that charge. We
will all keep in mind that you&#39;re not
even supposed to be in the prison camp
with Gla Maxwell&#39;s charge. By the way, I
will be there next month uh back in my
hometown. So maybe I need to go on by to
go by. That would be interesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, I wonder how close you can
get because these daily uh male guys all
have photos of Elizabeth Holmes like
working out and apparently
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they have those super long lens campers,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but there&#39;s no fences apparent like with
the camps like it&#39;s very lax apparently.
They just have to be back for count.
Like there&#39;s not a lot of enforcement.
It&#39;s basically if you leave like hey
just so you know we&#39;re coming after you
and you have such a cushy gig like why
would you actually want to? just in
terms of the way that these federal p
federal prison camps work. So maybe I
can get if you&#39;re a guard by the way,
federal prison camp, uh Brian, reach
out. I would love to talk to you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. All right. Interesting. But yeah,
apparently they&#39;re going to all sorts of
lengths to protect this lady.
