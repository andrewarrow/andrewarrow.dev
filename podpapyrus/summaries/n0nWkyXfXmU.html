then most likely 2025 has impacted you
in one way or another. And I have to
remind you that right now we are just
over midway through a 9year.
What does that mean? Well, in numerology
there are 9-year cycles both
individually and collectively. And of
course, every number, every year means
something different. And nine is the end
of this cycle. So it represents death.
It represents endings. It represents
I&#39;m I&#39;m losing all my words. It
represents realizations,
self-reflection,
um completion, right? It it is all of
these things. So, if you have been
thinking about a big career change, if
random people have been leaving your
life, if people from the past have been
coming back, if you&#39;re on the rocks with
your relationship, if you are at a place
where you don&#39;t even know who you are
anymore, then welcome to a 9y year.
You&#39;re actually exactly where you need
to be. Now, I will say that typically
because we&#39;re halfway and over halfway
through this year, this is a really good
time to actually shift the energy away
from endings and into thinking about at
least new beginnings.
Now, globally, collectively,
nationally, there is a lot going on this
year as well. We&#39;ve got massive wars and
so many people suffering. We have
political drama that is just tearing not
just the USA apart but many countries
all over the world apart. There is
polarity. There is fighting. There is
family drama. There is economic
downturns. There is a lot happening and
all of it is being pushed by and really
representing this nineyear cycle. It&#39;s
this cycle of endings.
It takes a long time to end especially
things like long relationships or
massive careers or even just an
understanding of your own
identification.
let alone on top of that collectively we
are shifting and changing and ending
massive structures and systems and it&#39;s
not going to happen overnight. So at the
end of this video and it won&#39;t be a long
video but at the end of this I&#39;m going
to go through how the collective
globally is shifting and what we can
actually expect for the next 9 years.
Before then, I want to talk a little bit
about your own individual changes and
shifting and sort of where you&#39;re at
now. And same thing, what you can expect
for 2026.
So, if this is where you&#39;re at right
now, then you found the right video. I
will make you feel a lot better by the
end of this and maybe a little bit
validated during because you&#39;re not
alone and we&#39;re all going through it
right now in one way or another. So,
let&#39;s deep dive. How do we get to even
just the understanding of a 9-year cycle
and numerology? Typically, at an
individual level, what you do is you
take your birth date. So, for me, it&#39;s
0708. And then you take the current
year, which would be 2025.
And you break down all of those numbers.
You add them up individually, and you
get your year number. For example, I&#39;m
in a year six, I believe. Maybe redo the
math on that. Do the math in your own
life and your own birthday. Okay? So,
you take your month, you take your day,
and you take the current year, break all
of those numbers down, add them up
individually, and you should get your
year. Now, if you get a weird number
like 17, you break that number down. You
add those up to get an individual number
1 through 9. Obviously, that would be
the year 8. Okay? That&#39;s going to tell
you a lot about where you&#39;re at right
now individually. Collectively, all you
got to do is you take the year. So 2 &#43; 0
&#43; 2 &#43; 5 and you get the year number.
Obviously, in this case, it&#39;s a year 9.
Both the year numerology and the
individual numerology are going to
affect us. It&#39;s kind of like astrology.
It&#39;s kind of like psychic readings. You
take everything with a grain of salt.
Question it all. Have an open mind. get
curious, but also just take what
resonates with you and leave the rest.
All right, there are a couple of really
important things to know about living
through a year nine and then also
getting prepared for a year one. Like I
mentioned, it&#39;s all about endings.
What no longer serves me? Am I truly
happy? Uh what have I identified with
for the past nine years? and what what
isn&#39;t working anymore and what could
potentially work. When we&#39;re in a year
of endings, we are in full
vulnerability. We are in a year of
complete surrender. And with that
complete surrender, you don&#39;t know who
you are anymore because you haven&#39;t
stepped into the new cycle. You are
still just letting go and clearing the
old. So, please keep that in mind.
Um, all right. Yeah. So, a lot even like
health things, maybe it was an old
injury from 10 years ago or 20 years ago
that has resurfaced or maybe you got
into some freak accident this year or
had some strange rash pop up. No matter
what it is at a health level, that is
typically signifying an ending, a
release, a purging, a detoxifying as
well. Um, that is challenging to say the
least. And that really forces us into
surrender. Health, a health crisis, a
relationship crisis, a family crisis, a
career crisis also has so many other
layers to it that challenge who we think
we are. It&#39;s a financial thing. It&#39;s a
labeling thing. It&#39;s um it&#39;s a
rosecolored glasses thing. I think in so
many ways we thought that where we were
maybe even a couple of years ago was
okay. That was enough. And now we&#39;re
starting to realize that it wasn&#39;t
enough and that you do need something
more. And you may not know what that
more is, but you know that what you&#39;ve
had is no longer enough. But it has been
enough, which can be confusing. And
that&#39;s because you are now growing out
of old energy. And as you grow out of
old energy, you realize that that was
all good for that period in time. But
now that time is changing and you&#39;re
changing and growing along with it.
Remember, all right, the only constant
in life is change. And I love
personally, I&#39;m 33 now. I love how I
forget that all the time. You know, I
sort of just ease into a routine in life
and I&#39;m like, &#34;Yeah, this is great and
this is easy and I could be here for the
next 20 years and then boom, the rug is
pulled from underneath me and I&#39;ve got
to change everything I thought I knew
and I&#39;m shocked every time and then I
have to laugh every time because I&#39;m
like here we are again. Why do I expect
that things will always remain the
same?&#34; And also if things were to remain
the same then you&#39;re not getting
challenged. If you&#39;re not getting
challenged you&#39;re not learning anything
new and therefore you&#39;re not growing.
Just because life is easy doesn&#39;t mean
that you&#39;re happy and it definitely
doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re moving forward.
All right. But also you can be happy.
You&#39;re totally allowed to be happy and
you&#39;re also totally allowed to have an
easy, blissful, great life. Um, we all
deserve that.
Okay, great. All right, so 2026 is a one
year. All right, individually and
collectively, it&#39;s new beginnings. And
we&#39;re going to talk about the collective
new cycle in a second. Um, but let&#39;s
talk about preparing yourself for
another new 9-year cycle. The number one
piece of advice I could give you right
now is
confront the anxiety.
And I&#39;ve got an anxiety book coming out
in the new year. Perfect timing. Gotta
love that. All right.
Anxiety is a messenger. And I I use the
word anxiety not necessarily as a
diagnosis but more as an emotional
experience that we go through that we
can all relate to from one extreme level
to another. Maybe it&#39;s just subtle.
Okay. It is a feeling of disees. It&#39;s a
feeling that something isn&#39;t sitting
right with you. And typically we don&#39;t
know where that&#39;s coming from. If we
were to really show up and listen to the
disease, to the anxiety, then we can
start to pinpoint what in your life is
no longer aligned to potentially that
new cycle or that new energy.
just remember that if you do not listen
at this time, if you do not be brutally
honest with yourself, if you do not take
radical responsibility for where you&#39;re
at in your life, and if you are happy or
not, it is all going to catch up to you
next year. There is no running from
this. There is no hiding from it. There
is no sweeping shit under the rug
anymore. This is the year. This is the
time to confront everything you&#39;re
feeling, everything you have been
feeling, and finally make that change.
Just fucking do it.
Okay? If you don&#39;t,
next year is going to be worse. Next
year, you&#39;re going to get a rug pull and
another rug pull and another rug pull.
Those rosecolored glasses you&#39;ve been
wearing are going to break. I can almost
guarantee that. And because 2026 is a
one year, you don&#39;t want to be bringing
any of the old lessons and the old
energetic baggage into the new cycle.
Deal with it now. Confront it now. Now,
for those of you who have had a very
confronting, very difficult, very
exhausting, lots of ego death type of
year. Okay, great. That&#39;s where I&#39;m at.
This is a turning point. This is a
really good time in August and then
moving into September where we can
finally catch a break, breathe a little
bit, and then start to think, what do we
want for the new year? What do I want
for my new life? What do I want for my
new identifiers? What do I want for my
new lessons and challenges? What do I
want from my new relationships? What do
I want from my new career or financial
situation or what have you? Okay?
But you got to show up and do the work.
You have to. You just can&#39;t run from it.
I have a couple of questions that you
should be asking yourself that will help
you do the work and show up so that 2026
is not confronting. It&#39;s a lot of new
opportunities. Once you end up doing the
work, the new friends, the new career
path, the new financial success, the new
opportunities will come. But you have to
show up. Okay. So, um first question is
what happened in 2016 for you? The
reason why I&#39;m bringing this up is
because 2016 was the last 9-year cycle.
It was the last 9-year
All right. So, what was going on in
2016? What dreams, what hopes, what
aspirations did you have for the next 10
years? What dramas, what emotions, what
lessons were you playing out from the
last nine years?
what was going on in 2016 and how can
you reflect on that right now? Okay. Uh,
next question is, what repeating
challenges have you faced between 2016
and 2025?
Once again, you want to focus on
repeating challenges.
Repeating what has repeated for you? And
then ask yourself, how is that coming
back up in 2025?
because that&#39;s what we&#39;re learning. We
are applying the lessons we&#39;ve learned
to the year and every single challenge
we&#39;ve been faced with in the last nine
years, it&#39;s all coming to a head right
now. Could be through different people,
through different means, through
different labels and names, but it&#39;s
it&#39;s all the same. When we can start
seeing the repeating pattern, it makes
what we&#39;re going through right now a lot
easier, and it puts a lot of things into
perspective. Okay, next question. What
life movement and growth have you had
between 2016 and 2025? So, you want to
reflect on the challenges and the
lessons from the past nine years, but
you also want to focus on the successes.
In 2016, I started my YouTube channel
for the first time. um you know I was
just really vulnerable and really open
and really wanting to find a community
and that&#39;s where I was at you know so
reflect on those things and then final
question is what do you want between
2026 and 2031
if you have a moment if you&#39;re not in
survival right now fantastic hopefully
it means that you&#39;ve done the work. And
if you have that moment of of
contemplation or time or energy on your
hands, what do you want moving forward?
What do you want for the next nine
years? Okay. Okay. So, let&#39;s talk about
Trump. Let&#39;s talk about war. Let&#39;s talk
about family. Let&#39;s talk about
collective before we get to the
collective expression of this year of
death and endings and what to expect for
the next nine. Um, quick shameless plug.
If you guys are really, really
struggling, I highly recommend my first
book. It&#39;s so funny because the other
day I walked by it and I started
laughing because I&#39;m like if if we were
to ever need this book, it would be now,
right? It&#39;s called You&#39;re Not Dying,
You&#39;re Just Waking Up. And there have
been many, many occasions in the past
year where I have just randomly flipped
it open, read a page, and felt a lot of
relief in the validation that I received
of, yeah, I&#39;m not dying. I&#39;m not going
crazy. I&#39;m just going through something
and this is normal. and all of the steps
and the stages on a spiritual awakening,
a rebirth, a dark night of the soul.
It&#39;s all in here and it is such a good
reminder. So, if you have not read the
book, go freaking read it. If you&#39;re
going through something and you have the
book, pick it up, ask for what you need,
open it up to any random page, and just
take it all in because this is normal.
Change is normal. That&#39;s what we&#39;re
going through. All right? So, go check
out that book. Um, and then also like I
don&#39;t do one-on-one sessions anymore,
but I do have a really good friend of
mine who does. If you&#39;re looking for
extra coaching, extra support, if you&#39;re
going through, she specializes in super
super dark energies and sort of negative
energetic removals. If you want and feel
like you really need that and need to
know how to navigate toxic relationships
or even just spiritual warfare, you want
to hit her up, okay? It&#39;s chararma and
her website, I believe, is chararma.com.
But please just have the moderators
hopefully you guys can um link the
website and we&#39;ll also put it in the
description and all of that great stuff.
You can also just email us supportal
elalizabethril.com if you if that&#39;s not
the right website. I just have her cell
phone number so I actually forget her
website but I highly recommend. Okay. Um
so please go check out both of those
resources if you are truly in it. So
let&#39;s talk collectively.
So we are in the middle of a great
awakening right now on so many different
levels energetically. Even the Schuman
resonance has been off the charts
recently. Um, what encompasses a great
awakening, right? People start
questioning
everything and that&#39;s also in my book,
right? I have a whole chapter on
question everything.
What prompts people to question? What
prompts people who are asleep, who are
delusional, who have who have taken the
bait, people who have been completely
programmed.
What gets those people to question
everything?
Suffering.
It&#39;s suffering.
And polarity is a really big part of
suffering.
If you find yourself fighting, if you
find yourself on the left or the right
extreme side of things, then you are
attaching yourself to a perspective, one
perspective. You are attaching yourself
to a label. You are attaching yourself
to just one way of being. No matter what
your label is, no matter what your
attachment is, no matter what you&#39;re
fighting for, right? It&#39;s one side of
things, which means that you start to
embody something called a linear
experience.
And what happens when you embody a
linear experience is you&#39;re only seeing
one side of the coin. We are not linear
beings. We are multiaceted. We are
quantum individuals. And even quantum
mechanics will tell you that much. What
that means is that we have many
different sides.
And with all of those different sides,
the more we attach oursel to one side of
the thing, the the reality, the coin,
the politics, the war, the whatever,
right? The more we feel like we&#39;re
lacking or missing something deep
Your mind will never tell you what
you&#39;re lacking or missing, which creates
anxiety and restlessness and this
feeling like you&#39;re not where you need
to be. All of that internal suffering,
all of that external suffering, all of
the challenges, all of the polarity,
it&#39;s going to drive people to question
everything.
Am I really happy? Is this who I really
am? Does this political belief make me
happy? Does fighting against or for this
war make me happy? Does my toxic
mother-in-law make me happy? Does this,
you know, make me h? like where am I at
in relation to the things that I
When you start to question everything,
you start to deprogram your mind.
Whether that society has programmed you
or your partner has programmed you or
your family has programmed you or you&#39;ve
just programmed yourself, right?
Ultimately, we get stuck in our own
neuropathways.
But our mind is neuroplastic. we can
change it even when we&#39;re older. All
So, we are moving collectively out of
and the systems are collapsing
collectively. We&#39;re at a 9-year but
yeah, I mean it happens every 9 years
and the systems have been built against
us pretty much since the dawning of
Now, before we get into sort of I really
actually want to focus on Trump and I I
have a lot to remind you guys of. Okay,
before we get there, I do want to talk
Yeah, just economic education, political
healthcare.
So, yeah, let&#39;s just circle back around
to to Trump for a second. I remote
viewed him a couple of years ago, I
believe. All of my Trump videos are on
my website. A lot of them are not on
YouTube for good reasons. So, just keep
that in mind. And I definitely can&#39;t put
anything on TikTok because they have
shut down my account on a number of
occasions. Um,
there are two sole missions that Donald
Trump has. Okay. One, and take or leave
any of this, please. If it resonates,
great. If not, this is a polarizing
topic and I am bipartisan. I don&#39;t care.
I don&#39;t choose a side. I really am
neutral. Um, as neutral as I can be. All
right, so please don&#39;t fight each other
in the comments. Please listen to what I
have to say for two seconds, please.
before you get all riled up,
he has two soul missions. Pretty much
they&#39;re the same. Because my biggest
question is like, what soul would sign
up for that job,
for that meat suit, you know? I don&#39;t
know. I&#39;m just curious. Okay. One,
bringer of chaos. Woohoo. Donald Trump,
his mission, one of his missions is the
bringer of chaos.
His second mission is
the disruptor.
He is the disruptor.
He disrupts through chaos. So, what is
he doing right now?
He is shaking up everything we&#39;ve known
collectively both nationally and
internationally.
He is disrupting all of the systems, the
political system, the economic system,
the health care system, the social
system, the education system. He&#39;s
disrupting all of it.
Is he a savior? No. Is he meant to bring
solutions? No.
He is meant to shake up what we have. He
is meant to bring chaos and destruction
essentially.
I don&#39;t care what side you&#39;re on. I
think we can all agree that he&#39;s doing a
bangup job of his mission. That&#39;s what
he&#39;s here to do. And a part of it is to
push polarity
because once again, the more polarized
we become as a group,
the more we break down our limiting
linear beliefs
and we begin to question the narrative.
When all we have is destruction and
endings and chaos,
we are forced to question
how, who, why, what&#39;s next? Does this
serve me? Does this serve the
collective? If not, great.
What does?
You can&#39;t see the forest through the
We have to break everything down right
now to finally have clarity on what is
and is not working both individually and
collectively.
Love him or hate him. Okay. He has a
and he&#39;s kind of fulfilling it and it&#39;s
scary as shit.
It is because it is causing so much
challenge, so much suffering, so much
instability,
so much chaos, and so much fear.
We can rise above it. You need to have
the perspective that this is a part of
the process that we&#39;re in right now
collectively,
that this is exactly where we should be.
So try not to get caught up in it. All
And I put down here, when traditional
systems collapse, alternative solutions
are born. I&#39;m going to repeat that
because it is impactful.
When traditional systems collapse,
alternative solutions are born.
Okay, great.
Um I have a couple of other statements.
He is taking down the old system by
breaking it. He is creating division so
that humanity can better understand
polarity and wake up. He is not meant to
bring solutions just to clear the old.
All right. So let&#39;s talk about the next
cycle 2026. All right. Before I give you
the final message on what we&#39;re moving
into individually and what we&#39;re moving
into collectively, and they&#39;re very
different, by the way, um, if you like
this video, definitely give it a thumbs
up. All right, subscribe to the channel
if you&#39;re brand new here. I know I saw a
couple of new people join the chat and
share this video. So many people are
feeling it. So many people are
struggling. So many people are in their
endings or their dark night of the soul.
Whether it&#39;s getting them this book or
just talking to them or sending them
this video, it can help. All right, so
just it&#39;s just so important that we all
know we&#39;re not alone in this right now
and that there is hope and that there is
light on the other side of the tunnel.
Okay, but definitely like, share, and
subscribe if you haven&#39;t. And of course,
if you like this kind of content, um,
yeah, keep coming back because there&#39;s a
lot going on.
So, 2026 is a oneyear. It starts a brand
new 9-year cycle. That&#39;s exciting. It&#39;s
scary. We don&#39;t know what to expect.
At a collective level, I would love to
say that yes, 2026 is the year of
rebirth and new and solutions and
everyone&#39;s just going to live in peace
and harmony. And that is just so so far
from the truth. As a matter of fact,
2026 to 2031 collectively is going to be
a whole 9-year cycle of collapse.
More systemic collapse, more economic
collapse, more more um all of the
things. Systemic collapse, political
collapse, more polarity, more
aggression, more rioting, more all of
that. Okay. So,
everything we see kind of this year is
like ending the old cycle collectively,
but it&#39;s also going to just bleed right
on into 2026.
And we&#39;re not just collapsing a couple
of years of systemic build. We are
collapsing decades and generations of
humanity&#39;s systemic buildup. That all
just feeds the 1%. I think we all know
who the systems are benefiting and it&#39;s
definitely not any one of us, right?
We&#39;ve got to collapse that. It&#39;s going
to take another nine years. We really
just started really since 2020 this
whole downturn of collapse and
dysregulation. We&#39;ve got nine more years
of that collectively. Try not to get
sucked in. Try not to feed polarity. Um
at an individual level, I have good news
for you. This next 9-year cycle is all
about rebirth. It&#39;s about reinventing
yourself. It&#39;s about opportunities. It&#39;s
about abundance. It&#39;s about creativity.
It&#39;s about spiritual expansion and
Whatever it is that you&#39;ve always wanted
your whole life, this is the time. This
is the cycle. There is no more waiting.
However, you now have to clear out and
purge and release and heal and forgive
and let go of not just 9 years of
energies and lessons and challenges, but
a lifetime&#39;s worth.
So, you&#39;ve got this. I&#39;m right there
with you. It&#39;s time to start fresh, but
you got to feel the old before you start
the new. I love you guys so so much.
Thank you for being here, a part of the
community. It really just means so so
much to me. Keep up the good work. I
know it can be difficult, but this is
all happening for for the best, for the
better. And you may not know what&#39;s
next, but that&#39;s a perfect place to be.
All right, bye for now. I will see all
of you in the next one.
