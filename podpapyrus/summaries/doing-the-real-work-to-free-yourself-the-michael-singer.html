<li>Spiritual and personal growth are the same thing - just two sides of the same coin</li>
<li>You have issues inside yourself (fears, insecurities, desires, guilt, embarrassment) - not outside</li>
<li>These negative emotions are your roadmap to spirituality because they are the obstacles blocking your spiritual flow</li>
<li>Spirituality is your natural state - you don't achieve it, you remove the obstacles preventing it</li>
<li>Like rocks in a stream causing turbulence, remove the inner blockages and the natural flow becomes peaceful</li>
<li>First step: honestly recognize and acknowledge your inner mess without denial or spiritual ego</li>
<li>Practice witness consciousness - step back and objectively observe what's happening inside you without getting lost in it</li>
<li>Meditation helps you practice being aware of being aware, not about achieving special states</li>
<li>When disturbances arise, you have three choices: suppress it, try to fix it externally, or let it go</li>
<li>Suppressing creates karma and stored pain that will resurface when triggered</li>
<li>Trying to fix externally pollutes your environment and relationships with your inner garbage</li>
<li>The third option is to relax and release - let the disturbance flow through you without resistance</li>
<li>Every time you successfully let go instead of reacting, you build the power of your center/self</li>
<li>This practice transforms negative energy into spiritual power, making you stronger for future challenges</li>
<li>Always deal with what's inside you first before addressing external situations</li>
<li>95% of problems disappear when you let go of your inner reaction to them</li>
<li>This constant practice of letting go in daily life is the real spiritual work that leads to permanent liberation</li>
<li>Eventually this builds such inner power and joy that you become naturally drawn into higher spiritual states and union with the divine</li>

doing the real work to free yourself
with michael singer
as you become clearer
in life you realize that spiritual
and personal growth are exactly the same
they&#39;re just looking at two sides of the
same coin
why is that spiritual growth supposed to
be about god
and personal growth supposed to be out
making something good of yourself
cleaning out yourself raising yourself
i would prefer that nobody knew anything
about god
that they only knew about cleansing
themselves
because if you&#39;re not there yet
god just can be a concept to you a
which is of no use nothing
if you work with yourself to raise
you will come into a state where you
will understand what they meant by the
word god
you don&#39;t have to use the word god use
any word you want
it&#39;s just describing a state of being
so what does it mean to grow personally
it means to notice that you have issues
inside yourself
you think you have issues outside no you
have issues inside
there are fears insecurities desires
needs wants
self-consciousness embarrassment guilt
these are all words that describe things
going on inside ourselves
guilt is not something outside it&#39;s
something inside need is not something
outside it&#39;s something inside
yes you&#39;re guilty about something yes
you need something or you think you do
but the actual experience is inside of
those experiences these terrible things
they just talked about
that&#39;s how you go to god those are your
you cannot ignore those you cannot run
away from those they
are literally the road map of achieving
spiritual states
but people don&#39;t want to do that they
want to say well but those things are
not spiritual
guilt is not spiritual insecurity not
embarrassment&#39;s not spiritual so how in
the world can they be the road map
to spirituality because they are what is
in the way of spirituality
and since they are what is in the way
they&#39;re what you must deal with
they are the obstacles you must remove
well if i remove the obstacles
how do i become spiritual wrong if you
remove the obstacles you are spiritual
there&#39;s nothing else to do period
nothing all right
if you have a river or a stream in which
there&#39;s rapids
and there&#39;s spray and there&#39;s currents
and eddies and you look at it carefully
and you say well upstream it&#39;s calm
flowing nicely
but here oh my god it&#39;s a complete
message rapids and eddies and
sprays and all kinds of things if you
look what you&#39;re going to see
is that there are rocks there are
obstacles blockages
in that stream that when this water flow
is coming down
they&#39;re hitting those things and they
are then
creating currents creating disturbance
so if you ask me what should i do if i
want to get rid of the disturbance
and i tell you take the rocks out and
you say to me well i understand i could
take the rocks out but then what do i do
to get rid of the disturbance
that&#39;s what i just told you you take
that stuff out of there
there&#39;s nothing else to do period you
take those rocks out
it becomes absolutely still and
beautiful in a beautiful flow
there is nothing else to do on your
spiritual path
except remove the obstacles to
spirituality
once you do that and to whatever degree
you do that
it just is the natural state of things
spirituality is the natural state of
it is not something you achieve it&#39;s not
something you strive for
it&#39;s not something you do something
there are no techniques to achieve god
there are techniques to remove the
obstacles that you put in the way of god
right but there are no techniques to
achieve god you see the difference all
so that&#39;s where everybody goes wrong so
the gida says
of men who seek me there are some who
reach very high states
they&#39;re very reverent they&#39;re great one
comes to know me as i am whoa that&#39;s
right that&#39;s because of what i just told
you you do all the tapasya and
and renunciations and everything you
want to do and all you did was become
somebody who people respect because you
did all these fire ceremonies into
possession
did mantras for 67 years and so without
everything anything you want all right
it is the removal of the blockages
then the natural state really that
analogy i gave you of removing those
rocks from the water
you can see that once those rocks are
gone there is you don&#39;t have to get an
and iron out the current you have to do
anything to make it right
it was the obstacles that were keeping
the experience from being its natural
is exactly the same inside of you that&#39;s
these disturbed forces inside of you are
the road map to spirituality
they are the rocks period all right
those things i described all those dirty
little words
embarrassment self-consciousness guilt
it&#39;s just beautiful so what do i do with
now the first is to recognize yes
i&#39;m a mess like hey my name is joe and
i&#39;m an alcoholic
my name is making him a flaming mess
you just sit there and look in there
and be honest about what you see i don&#39;t
care about what you want to see
that&#39;s the biggest trap in the world
that&#39;s spiritual ego
that&#39;s like sitting here on the side of
the stream i&#39;m going to keep you i&#39;m
going to wear that analogy out
sitting on the side of the stream the
rapids and all the currents are going
and you&#39;re sitting there saying i
visualize calm
i&#39;m visualizing calm uh i don&#39;t see calm
something wrong i&#39;m not doing it right i
visualize come what&#39;s the matter with
you man
remove the rocks but in order to remove
the rocks
you better be honest about what you&#39;re
looking at
all right remember shakespeare this
above all to know itself be true
and it shall follow as a night the day
thou shalt not be false to any man
right this is the truth you have to be
willing to look and see what you see
do not try to put nice white lights
around your garbage and sit there and
say i&#39;m pure
all right it&#39;s not the right that is
spiritual ego
that is i want to be there i&#39;m not there
i&#39;ll use affirmation i&#39;ll use this i&#39;ll
tell people i am i&#39;ll behave in a way
i&#39;ll dress accordingly
i&#39;ll do every single thing that a
spiritual person would do then i&#39;m
spiritual no you&#39;re not
it&#39;s nothing it&#39;s the biggest trap that
could possibly exist
is only one way out and that is to do
the work
of removing these obstacles that are in
the way of the state of absolute beauty
and ecstasy
of divinity so okay first
you recognize don&#39;t be afraid to
recognize there&#39;s nothing wrong with
seeing the rocks if you don&#39;t i&#39;m gonna
i said i&#39;m gonna use this analogy
if you don&#39;t like seeing the rocks you
will never get them out
right or wrong if i sit there and
somebody told me there are rocks
in the water and they&#39;re causing all the
currents i&#39;m so afraid of them
because i don&#39;t like the currents i
don&#39;t want to see rocks do you no
i don&#39;t like rocks they cause trouble
they must be of the devil or something
all right so i don&#39;t want to see these
well you&#39;re never going to see them
you&#39;re never going to deal with them
you&#39;re never going to do anything
because you&#39;re afraid of them you
understand that you&#39;re that&#39;s denial
psychology denial fear etc you have to
be willing to sit there and say
i have now progressed spiritually to the
point of understanding
that i am blocking the flow of god the
flow of shakti
the flow of spirit from inside of me i
am doing it
i am doing it there that&#39;s your first
point right
nobody&#39;s making you drink go today right
nobody&#39;s making you drink
oh no she drives me to drinking no no no
no my drive drive no
no no go come back when you&#39;re ready
you&#39;re the one who&#39;s drinking you&#39;re the
one who picks the glass up and pour
stuff in it and puts in your mouth
and swallows right or wrong nobody else
is doing it it&#39;s the same thing here
you have put these blockages inside
and you are holding these blocks inside
of yourself so if you&#39;re not willing to
look at them
nothing good is going to happen do you
understand that
all right so you start with what we call
witness consciousness
krishnamurti called it the seat of
objective observation
but you will not be willing to look at
yourself objectively while you are
judging yourself
do you understand and what that means is
i don&#39;t want to see what i&#39;m looking at
that&#39;s what judging does
you have to be excited i remember when i
first got to the point
that instead of thinking that stuff
inside of me that was causing all this
was what i don&#39;t want it&#39;s terrible it&#39;s
keeping me from god i try to meditate
above it i do anything i can to get rid
of it
and then i realize no this is what&#39;s
keeping me from god
therefore if i see something it&#39;s
you have to change your entire attitude
about yourself
the worse it is inside the better the
more trouble it causes
oh my god i got myself a big fish
all right you have to feel
that i am willing to deal with this
stuff i am willing to look at this stuff
not get in it that&#39;s the whole thing
psychology goes the wrong way they get
you started
right but we&#39;re going to see the
difference between spirituality
psychology as we go through this
so first you have to be awake if you are
not awake what does that mean i&#39;m not
awake we talk about it spiritually right
they&#39;re awake
not enlightened just awake what does it
mean it means that
normally the stuff that&#39;s going on
inside is so overwhelming it is so
not only do you not want to look at it
and you can&#39;t deal with it but you are
lost in it you&#39;re
in the rapids drowning well you can&#39;t
very well be outside looking at the
you&#39;re trying to survive you&#39;re trying
to keep your head above the water
aren&#39;t you right you&#39;re trying to take a
breath try to everyone
not go down three times that&#39;s where a
normal human being is
is they are in the fear of drowning so
they&#39;re not looking what&#39;s causing it
they&#39;re just trying to stay keep their
head above the water can you relate to
all right the worse our times are the
more we&#39;re like that
you have to be able to get out of the
water which is
again witness consciousness your
consciousness has extricated itself
from being in it it didn&#39;t get rid of it
but it can watch it it can see it all
right how do you do that meditation
meditation is great mantra&#39;s great see
all of a sudden there&#39;s techniques but
the techniques are not about going to
the techniques are about first getting
out of the water well
why would meditation work because the
noise that&#39;s going on inside of you
is creating disturbance when you sit
down to meditate
what you&#39;re sitting there saying i don&#39;t
care how you meditate your business when
you sit down to meditate you&#39;re saying
for let&#39;s say 15 minutes in the morning
15 minutes in the evenings but nowadays
they teach you guys
fine all right you sit down and for this
15 minutes
it&#39;s not about going to god that&#39;s why
people can&#39;t meditate because they just
set these standards and then they burn
themselves out it&#39;s not about seeing
blue pearls it&#39;s not about seeing white
lights it&#39;s not about going to god
it&#39;s about i have set aside 15 minutes
to practice being aware
of being aware that&#39;s what it is don&#39;t
come to me and say i can&#39;t meditate i
why there&#39;s no such thing i understand
why he said well every time i sit down
my mind just goes crazy
it won&#39;t stop it keeps talking i&#39;m going
to touch your feet i&#39;m going to
pronounce you
bow down i&#39;ll touch your feet you&#39;ll
have to come back three times where you
figure out what i&#39;m doing
all right you just told me that for 15
minutes you were the witness of your
my mind won&#39;t shut up it keeps talking
about this
somebody&#39;s watching so during that 15
you actually watched that your mind
wouldn&#39;t shut up that&#39;s a very high
do you see why people screw up
meditation because they define
meditation as the mind shutting up
no that&#39;s not that&#39;s just a state that
you can have there
but if your mind doesn&#39;t shut up and
you&#39;re aware that your mind doesn&#39;t shut
if your heart is bothering you and
you&#39;re aware that your heart&#39;s bothering
i was trying to meditate but then this
thing came back up from before that
bothered me my i don&#39;t know why but
happened years ago and my heart started
hurting and i just sat there and watched
like good good
do you understand that right at least
twice a day please for 15 minutes
take the seat of objective observation
notice what is going on inside don&#39;t
judge what&#39;s going on inside
don&#39;t decide what&#39;s supposed to be going
on inside do you see that
just notice that your job just notice
who&#39;s not capable of doing that
yeah truth is you have no choice you&#39;re
gonna notice what&#39;s going on inside
okay i&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t use
techniques such as
follow your breath what does that do all
right i noticed that if i just leave it
alone it keeps talking
very good at least you&#39;ve noticed that
believe me it didn&#39;t start talking when
you sat down
do you understand that people tell me
that no when i try to meditate my mind
gets worse
that is a lie that is ridiculous right
it&#39;s just when you sit down to meditate
you notice that your mind is pretty darn
all right it didn&#39;t get worse when you
sat down it&#39;s going on the entire time
you&#39;re just noticing it so yes notice
if you have been given techniques such
as following your breath is a very nice
technique to use
what is the purpose of that there&#39;s
nothing spiritual about following your
there is but won&#39;t discuss it there&#39;s
nothing spiritual about following your
breath what you&#39;re doing is taking your
consciousness
off of your mind and putting it onto
something else like the movement of your
or counting your breath that&#39;s why these
techniques work because you are
practicing
being aware of what&#39;s going on in there
then you are practicing what i call
extricating your consciousness freeing
your consciousness
liberating your consciousness from
having to watch what&#39;s going on in there
you&#39;re not judging you&#39;re not
suppressing it right if i&#39;m looking at
you and i&#39;m having a problem
i just look over here oh problem gone
right just move your consciousness
don&#39;t mess i don&#39;t have to change you
right i just stop
looking when you watch your breath your
consciousness has now
taken its awareness off of the noise of
your mind and it is watching your breath
or counting that&#39;s why mantra works
right again these things have deeper
spirituality also but i&#39;m not talking
about that
right you do a mantra and what you&#39;ve
done is tell your mind i want you to
guru on guru god god whatever the heck
it is whatever you want to do for a
right if i teach my mind to do that and
then my mind starts
talking about other things i now have a
choice i can either pay attention to
what my mind is saying on its own
or i can pay attention to the mantra
that&#39;s all you have to do and where do
you see what
you&#39;ll change your entire life you just
gave your consciousness an
alternate place to go as opposed to
well okay my analogy when you are
sitting on the mantra
instead of in the mess you just got out
of the water you still mess is still
right but you extricated yourself you
put your consciousness elsewhere
these are the reasons that meditation
works do you understand that
right is there another spiritual thing
that the guru touched you
yes yes but i&#39;m not interested in that
none really
all that stuff happens by itself you
don&#39;t have to think about it don&#39;t even
get involved in it
you understand that if there are deeper
layers of things just you know something
a guru gave you a mantra and it&#39;s
powered with every rishi that ever said
it that&#39;s what they tell us right
probably true
all right it says all this stuff fine
what&#39;s that got to do with you
it&#39;s true anyways right you don&#39;t need
to think about it you understand that
so if you&#39;re sitting there following
your breath and god forbid your breath
stops and you go into somalia oh my god
i hope you&#39;re all right
right and you come back all right it&#39;s
just what happened
while you were doing your work that&#39;s
not your work
don&#39;t you ever try to go into samadhi
don&#39;t you ever try to achieve these high
spiritual states
because all that what they will do is
become part of your ego you understand
that i went into samadhi
mayor baba talked against samadhi one of
the greatest master
brought the face of the earth he
literally he said i go to india i see
these people they&#39;re totally breathless
like you can put their finger under
their nose they sit there for days
they don&#39;t breathe all these people come
around put flowers next to them they&#39;re
bowing down to them
right and then they come back and start
yelling at everybody why are you over
there you&#39;re sitting too close go over
i&#39;m not interested i&#39;m in trouble aren&#39;t
you have work to do do you understand
that&#39;s where the focus should be so
there are these techniques
you all have different techniques you
all have different personalities you
have different tendencies
fine find something that you feel
comfortable with that works with you
and just use it for the purpose i said
to free first of all to start
can you achieve a seat of objective
observation
where you are watching your mind and
you&#39;re watching your heart
now that people misunderstand even there
because they say
i&#39;m watching my mind okay i&#39;m watching
my mind i&#39;m watching my mind i said no
no that&#39;s not watching your mind that&#39;s
your mind watching your mind
you understand that you created a layer
inside your mind that thinks it&#39;s
supposed to look at the other layer of
your mind
you are always watching your mind or you
wouldn&#39;t know what you were thinking
do you understand that do you have
thoughts how do you know
do you have to try to know that you have
thoughts you wish you didn&#39;t know
you are always the witness you are
always there
does your heart ever hurt anybody have a
heart that hurt
how do you know no i&#39;m serious how do
you know your heart hurts
sounds like a stupid question doesn&#39;t it
that is the witness
the one that knows what&#39;s going on you
don&#39;t have to try
how hard do you have to try to see that
your heart hurts how much you know
better meditate for 20 hours so that
you&#39;re conscious enough to know that
your heart hurts
no you don&#39;t have a problem your heart
hurts you know your heart hurts
who knows your heart hurts so don&#39;t ever
misunderstand what&#39;s meant by objective
observation or witness consciousness
it is not something you do it is not an
act of will
it is not a place you go it is the state
of being aware
of what is going on inside your mind and
what is going on inside your heart
obviously you know what is going on in
your mind what&#39;s going on your heart or
we wouldn&#39;t be talking about it
the problem is you get sucked in you get
into you know the waters are tumultuous
but they&#39;re so tumultuous that you dove
in and you&#39;re drowning and so on
all right the the highest analogy i can
give you to witness consciousness is as
you walk into a room there&#39;s people
places things everything going on it&#39;s a
nice place big party
right and there&#39;s this little tv screen
in the corner a little flat screen you
know not a big one
not 65 inch right just a 22 inch 23 inch
right and sitting over there and all of
a sudden you&#39;re walking around
and something catches your attention
what does that mean your consciousness
focusing on what&#39;s on the tv screen
instead of focusing what&#39;s in the room
perfectly normal correct but all of a
sudden it&#39;s really interesting like
something you&#39;ve always wanted to know
about your whole life
all of a sudden shows up on the tv
screen you start to really get sucked in
next thing you know and you don&#39;t even
know how you&#39;re sitting on a couch
and there&#39;s nothing else in this room
there&#39;s no people there&#39;s no place
there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s no party
there&#39;s just what&#39;s going on a tv screen
ever happened to you
or a book you can do it right you get we
say you got lost in the book
you got lost in the tv program why&#39;d you
get lost because it was so interesting
to you
that your consciousness became fixated
on it and was not aware of anything else
all right so that is the state of being
in the rapids you&#39;re now lost in
the object the subject is lost in the
are you sitting there on the couch yes
are you in the party yes
but your consciousness is not you have
projected your consciousness
your consciousness has been attracted or
distracted any words you want to use
so that it&#39;s now involved in the object
of consciousness
which is the tv screen what&#39;s going on
there and not paying attention to
anything else
that&#39;s what happens when you get lost in
your mind you&#39;re not
in your mind you&#39;re sitting on the couch
watching the mind just like you sit on
the couch and watch the tv
right you are aware of what the minds
are doing aren&#39;t you all right
all you have to do is be less interested
and it has to be the essence of it
if you are less interested in what&#39;s
going on that tv you&#39;re going to find
yourself back on the couch and
oh it&#39;s boring a commercial came on oh
oh what was joey do oh we&#39;re the kids
oh how much time right you woke up
that&#39;s what it means to wake up
that&#39;s what it means to come back to the
seat of self
so if what&#39;s what&#39;s going on in the mind
or the heart
is so distracting it&#39;s so interesting
you&#39;re going to be sucked
into it so that&#39;s not witness
consciousness
you&#39;re still conscious you&#39;re still
aware you&#39;re just too aware how&#39;s that
you&#39;re fixated you&#39;re too aware not that
you&#39;re not aware you got a little bit
too close
didn&#39;t you and the next thing you know
you&#39;re lost in jealousy you&#39;re lost in
fear you&#39;re lost in insecurity
you&#39;re lost in heart pain and so on so
you need to find
out for yourself how it is that instead
of trying to build
another layer of mind that you say is be
here now so to be here now
okay i&#39;m being here now am i being here
now i think so no i wasn&#39;t there a
minute ago maybe
that&#39;s tiring you know that&#39;s tough man
i grew up in the 60th something all
we&#39;re doing when ron does put the book
all right
are you here now i don&#39;t know am i here
instead you realize you are always there
or you wouldn&#39;t know that you know that
you know you just got too close
so again it&#39;s not about coming back to
the seat of consciousness
it&#39;s about letting go of what you&#39;re
paying attention to
it&#39;s always about letting go do you
understand that so
when you meditate or you do any of the
practice you&#39;re doing
remember the purpose is that you be
there and you&#39;ll be aware that you&#39;re
and you&#39;re aware of what&#39;s going on if
you will do this and practice this
during your practices and wake up your
practices if you do this you&#39;re going to
find out all by itself
that as terrible as it is you&#39;re going
to be there all day
at some point you&#39;re just going to be
there all day and you&#39;ll hate me for it
you&#39;re going to notice that your heart
goes through your heart loves somebody
and your mind says oh my god they&#39;re my
soul mate
and they pick their nose and i&#39;m someone
who never picked their nose
and my kids start watching this maniacal
thing that&#39;s going on in there
don&#39;t you right and it&#39;s not nearly as
much fun
temporarily as getting lost on the tv
screen and believing that it&#39;s your life
and oh my god we&#39;re gonna get a house
and it&#39;s gonna be so beautiful
right okay okay let me clue you in while
those rapids are going on in there
there&#39;s not a single place you can stick
your head up oh i can breathe now
don&#39;t worry it&#39;ll come back over you
understand that you got to do the real
so i&#39;ve showed you what the real work is
get out of that stream
because you&#39;re not in it you&#39;re just
projecting your consciousness into it
sit on the side and then notice there
are rocks this whole talk&#39;s going to do
that and those that are rocks
and then i&#39;m going to teach you how to
take the rocks out and then it&#39;s over
you&#39;ll never have to do anything and no
actual will no not what i need to do
to maintain my spiritual state that&#39;s
ridiculous
you understand that there will be
nothing left but the highest
state that could possibly exist it will
never betray you nothing
all right that&#39;s what i want for you so
basically first
you need to achieve a state of what&#39;s
called witness consciousness
objective observation but now you
understand what it means you&#39;re already
you&#39;re already watching the tv you&#39;re
already on the couch the problem is you
have projected your consciousness
into the mess so much that you lost your
center we call your seat of self or your
but you&#39;re still aware so my experience
is that the highest way that you can
come back to seat of self is not
through an act of forceful spiritual
will it is through an act of
letting go of what you&#39;re clinging to so
you&#39;re sitting there and
somebody doesn&#39;t say hello to you when
you call out hey sally how are you doing
they don&#39;t say hello and all of a sudden
you feel insecure inside
is that just me or you know anything
about that any of you know what the word
insecure means i just made it up right
you start feeling these weird things
going on inside correct
all right what you need to be willing to
do is notice
it got weird and the tendency is going
to be i don&#39;t want it to be weird
we thought we&#39;re still there right i
don&#39;t like it i don&#39;t want it to be
so notice it&#39;s very deep you&#39;re going to
want to do something about
do it hear me you&#39;re not going to want
to sit there and weird you&#39;re going to
want to do something about it
and your tendency is to go running at
either running after sally
sally didn&#39;t you hear me right or to
talk to george
how come something wrong with sally did
she not hear me what do you think right
or call up later
or or make a note or text somebody or do
you want to do something
to try to make the weirdness feel better
anybody there
this is your spiritual work this is
right where the tires hit the
rubber hits the road all right so you
want a tendency to do that
if you&#39;re not doing that because you&#39;re
that&#39;s if you&#39;re a more assertive
aggressive type person
if you are somebody who&#39;s a little shy
or a little a little more withdrawn
you suppress you sit there and say well
i don&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t call me i
i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t care i just no i
don&#39;t want to think about it and
you&#39;ll push it away ever do that ever
push away the ickiness
i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to feel it i don&#39;t
want to feel this i can&#39;t have time for
right so you are either fight or flight
you&#39;re either out there
fighting changing calling doing
something or
coming inside and pushing this away
those are the two
normal human reactions to yickiness
and you do it all the time what one does
is build up these suppressions inside of
believe me push it away she didn&#39;t mean
anything i know she didn&#39;t mean anything
and push it away wait next time you see
sally wait the next time you hear
sally&#39;s name
tell me what&#39;s going to happen you feel
the ickiness again
yes or no okay that&#39;s because you kept
it inside of you you stored it inside of
that is the most ridiculous thing in the
world i don&#39;t like the meal i just ate
it made me sick
please give me more so i can take it
home taste it every morning to remind
myself how sick it made me
that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when you push
geeky stuff inside of you and you push
it away
you&#39;re storing it inside of you of
course it&#39;s going to come back up when
it gets triggered
triggered by the name sally triggered by
a car that looks like sally&#39;s car
triggered by anything you understand
that you don&#39;t
want that stuff in there all right what
about if i run after it i call that
being mr
mr and miss fix it i&#39;m going to fix it
right i&#39;m going to fix it
fixer-upper right you&#39;re going to go yes
run after sally find out what&#39;s going on
or i&#39;m going to write or no i&#39;m going to
text somebody
and i asked george if he talked to could
he talk to sally but don&#39;t mention that
i got upset because
it could have been nothing all right oh
my god i don&#39;t care how tactful you are
it&#39;s disgusting all right that&#39;s where
karma comes from listen you guys use
these words and very few people
understand
it if you suppress something you
built the karma if you will inside
yourself because you set up a spring
that you push
down with the potential to come back up
so you&#39;re carrying the past inside of
you triggered
if you go outside because of the
yickiness inside i
guarantee you in the end anything you
touch will get icky
if you run off after sally and sit there
and say why didn&#39;t you say hello
you hit sally&#39;s stuff what are you
talking about
i didn&#39;t do anything you&#39;re the one next
thing you know you get this whole
shtick going you hear me and they never
see that happen
and it escalates up and it just gets
absolutely ridiculous
you know you&#39;re a lover right and he
said i i
love you and that night i love you they
said yeah i love you too
he&#39;s like oh
but you know you&#39;re not gonna say
anything right so three days later
all right all of a sudden you go up to
somebody and say you know
i don&#39;t feel like you love me like you
used to
oh i do what are you saying why are you
saying that
well the other night god you&#39;re so
insecure i i
i can&#39;t even deal with you i didn&#39;t do
anything that i never said you&#39;re in a
you understand that anybody i&#39;m sorry to
be so personal
right this stuff is terrible
that&#39;s karma you took the garbage inside
of you
and you dumped it into your environment
most of you like to think that you&#39;re
environmentalist
you understand that that you don&#39;t want
people polluting and so on you&#39;re
polluting every second you&#39;re taking
this garbage that came up inside
and you&#39;re dumping it out into the world
and it will come back it will pollute
how&#39;s that
right pollution is its own karma isn&#39;t
it it pollutes
okay it makes a mess so it&#39;s not you
don&#39;t if you&#39;re in there you&#39;re not
comfortable you want to do something you
it&#39;s mr fix it or miss fix it it&#39;s not
going to do it it&#39;s going to make a mess
this or mr suppress it is not going to
do anything well one of my choices
that&#39;s what nobody will teach you
there&#39;s another choice
when the yickiness comes up inside and
you are
conscious of it you are aware you&#39;re in
a witness
and you see that i&#39;m not comfortable
with it let it
go but i didn&#39;t fix it that&#39;s right
but i didn&#39;t push it away that&#39;s right
let it go
everything needs its day in the sun so
this yickiness has come up
your conscious and what you do is you
don&#39;t resist it
you don&#39;t go with it and you don&#39;t run
away from it you just relax that&#39;s what
i teach you
relax when you see it you are the
consciousness
i am watching so my tv that&#39;s not
comfortable it&#39;s just a damn tv
it&#39;ll come it&#39;ll go i don&#39;t need to
throw something at the tv
i don&#39;t have to run out of house
screaming i can just let the moment pass
and finish its flow through me that
doesn&#39;t feel very natural does it
someday it&#39;ll be the natural thing you
have to train yourself
to realize it is just the stuff that&#39;s
inside of you that got hit
the rocks that&#39;s why it caused the
current if you will relax and release
believe it or not the water will wash
the rocks away
if whatever is holding the rocks in
place is not there the flow of the
can cleanse itself if you will relax
when this disturbance happens inside of
you just relax
relax breathe do mantra whatever you
want just leave it
alone which is the hardest thing to do
isn&#39;t it
right the hardest thing to do you&#39;re
sitting there you&#39;re with your boyfriend
or girlfriend or spouse
and they&#39;re dancing with somebody and
you think it&#39;s cute until all of a
sudden this is a little bit too close
a little bit too long and this jealousy
comes up inside of you
right i&#39;m telling you it&#39;s the same
thing as with sally
if you do anything about it suppress it
you&#39;re gonna
you&#39;ll ruin your relationship you
understand that you&#39;ll hold well
i want to give her the space you know
you push it down there you&#39;re never
gonna love that person again
the way you loved them before because
you just blocked the flow of love
with that garbage you just shoved inside
of you do you understand that
so you thought you were being high i
don&#39;t want to dump this jealousy on them
i&#39;ve always been jealous i don&#39;t
say anything but you pushed it down when
you push it down you are stopping and
blocking your shakti flow
or i&#39;m going to go out and say something
i&#39;ll be cute right
or i could walk by and accidentally
spill my drink on him or something
right anything like that just the noise
that the mind
makes about trying to fix it i&#39;m telling
let go what do you mean i don&#39;t want
this stuff inside of me
therefore i&#39;m going to let it go if you
don&#39;t want something you let it go
you don&#39;t keep it all right so you relax
if you will relax i assure you over time
not once
takes time took time to put all that
junk in there over time
you have created a space inside of you
by relaxing into the seat itself
where this garbage will get pushed up it
has to come up
it&#39;s going to come up you&#39;re going to
feel it it will go through
you&#39;re listening to the michael singer

now back to michael singer on doing the
real work
to free yourself
it can do what we call transmute it
and when you release the stuff inside of
you first
it loosens up then little chips start to
block off
and next thing you know in the exact
same situation somebody&#39;s dancing
and you don&#39;t feel jealous and you go
home and you say hey
i used to feel jealous i guess i&#39;m
growing that&#39;s right
that&#39;s growth you got rid of something
inside of you
that was causing currents and
disturbances that&#39;s the way to deal with
disturbances the buddha is called
working at the root
you&#39;re working at the root cause not the
now are you willing to do that
right that&#39;s the question of spiritual
growth notice it doesn&#39;t sound
all blue lighty and auras and chakras
fun things all right that sounds like
work all right
that is your spiritual work that is your
spiritual work that is your personal
so what happens first maintain your seat
of witness consciousness what does it
things are going to happen which tend to
pull you in
i teach this in an untethered right
you&#39;ll feel a tendency to get
pulled in to the disturbance and that
sounds silly why would i want to get
pulled into the disturbance okay
let&#39;s say you&#39;re perfectly healthy
except a wasp bites you on your toe
okay guess where your consciousness is
going to go on your toe
i like picked on her because she got bit
the other day but all right
it&#39;s like say you dropped a hammer on
your toe the last place in the world you
want to put your mind your consciousness
is on the hurt
toe but that&#39;s where it&#39;s going and then
come on
okay your consciousness gets drawn
to the place of maximum disturbance
whether it&#39;s
whoa this is exciting okay conscious
goes there next thing you&#39;re running
away from your family
with the golf bro or something right
right or you drop something you tell
your conscience goes there it&#39;s the same
thing with your inner disturbances
the tendency is because i mean look
let&#39;s say a giant noise all of a sudden
happened outside
would you be listening to me or the
noise i say a bright light shined all of
a sudden now from outside
you ain&#39;t coming back here for a while
right your
consciousness gets drawn to the place of
largest distraction
how&#39;s that your consciousness is that&#39;s
that&#39;s what we mean by getting
distracted
my consciousness got drawn off of where
it was onto something that was
louder brighter or whatever it was
distracting
that neat turns out distraction is a
very spiritual word
all right it means your consciousness
got drawn over there
that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen inside
it&#39;s totally natural don&#39;t try to make
it not happen
if a disturbance comes up in your heart
it determines something in your mind
all of a sudden your conscience is going
to be drawn to that just like it&#39;s drawn
to the hurt toe
and i feel better it&#39;s perfectly natural
the question is what do you do about it
not did it happen so what&#39;s going to
happen you&#39;re going to start to see
there&#39;s a shakti
pull there&#39;s a pull of your pull on your
consciousness
toward the loudest thing the most
painful thing
the most comfortable thing the thing
that&#39;s most distracting
over time if you will work with yourself
then i&#39;m
way beyond you now right this takes time
if you will work with yourself
there will be a moment just the moment
in which you are aware
that that is happening that something is
like i&#39;m sitting here a noise happened i
was listening to mickey
and right before my consciousness goes
out to the noise i&#39;m aware
that my conscience is about to be drawn
out to the noise
well that&#39;s conscious you know a
conscious being you understand that
you&#39;re aware your consciousness
stayed meditation gives you this it
gives you that moment
where i&#39;m here i heard that
this slow motion i&#39;m here i heard that
and now i&#39;m going to be drawn over there
all right you understand what i&#39;m saying
right that moment they talk about right
that&#39;s the most precious moment in
creation why
because you now have the right to use
free will and believe it or not
your will now you listen to me your will
and i mean by your will your will you in
there okay the power you have
is stronger than any force that can ever
distract you or do anything to you
period you are the strongest thing in
will is the power of self it is the
power of chi-chakti
of conscious energy when an event
happens outside
and the consciousness starts to get
drawn toward it you have
every ability to relax and bring it back
every one of you do don&#39;t tell me i
don&#39;t have a very strong will
every the fact that you took human birth
that your will and your soul is evolved
to be transcendent to every single force
that can draw on it did you know that
that&#39;s why
people can do weird things you know
people do all kinds of weird things like
yakuza i hate to tell you this you ever
see their whole thing if they
if they insult their their master they
sit there and
it&#39;s japanese how am i telling you this
i don&#39;t know because i&#39;m showing you
i&#39;m showing you how powerful will is
right and they sit before their master
and their boss and they say i&#39;m so sorry
i&#39;ll show you how sorry i am they take a
they put their finger down and they cut
their finger off while they&#39;re
talking and looking and staring at that
and they they ceremonially
batch up their finger and give it give
the finger in a wrap claw this is true
right it&#39;s true statement in a wrap
clause they give it to the
to their boss their master they have the
mafia that kind of thing right
to sit there and say that&#39;s how sorry i
am that i didn&#39;t
didn&#39;t live up to your expectations all
right a lot of yakuza running around
with that
they leave their trigger finger last
right because they&#39;re mafia right
i&#39;m in trouble all right
but what i&#39;m trying to show you is
that&#39;s a lot of will
that&#39;s painful that&#39;s serious okay right
people do all kinds of things
because they want to they want to enough
to where their will is strong enough
that they can apply it you want out
see you&#39;re yakuza but for a different
reason right you&#39;re a great being you
want liberation
you know where it&#39;s like don&#39;t have the
garbage going on inside of you
are you willing when you get
consciousness awareness
that the moment you see it&#39;s about to
get pulled over here or over here
are you willing to relax are you willing
to just
relax you let it go god i always explain
it this way
people think you have to be strong to do
this you do not have to be strong to do
this is not a question of strength let&#39;s
say you&#39;re doing a tug of war
with i always say the entire gator
football team&#39;s on one end and you&#39;re on
this end all right
and you want to go home and have lunch
but they&#39;re go they&#39;re pointed the wrong
all right and you&#39;re pulling you&#39;re
holding you learned every technique you
learned how to bend your knees you learn
how to do
you know the karate stuff you learned
how to dig your heels in you learn
to wrap it around your waist and oh my
god you&#39;ve turned every single tug of
war technique that could possibly exist
and you&#39;re going they&#39;re pulling you all
right and all of a sudden
yoda shows up right little yoda sitting
down there right
luke let go
and he says there he says let me let go
but let go pull me face first
let go of the rope
whoa you see yod is very smart all right
what do you mean i&#39;m trying i&#39;m pulling
see where your hands are
see where your hands are holding the
rope yeah let go
relax your hands what will happen
many of you do go home to lunch
do you understand that the minute you do
that&#39;s why relaxation is
always the answer so when this
distraction
the jealousy the insecurity the whatever
it is right
it starts pulling on you and you i just
need you to have that conscious for one
to where instead of saying the solution
is to run after the solution is to
suppress it
right right they say you&#39;re attracted to
somebody it&#39;s inappropriate
all right you&#39;re married and all of a
sudden you get attracted to somebody
what are you gonna do
i&#39;m gonna suppress it that didn&#39;t happen
no it&#39;s terrible oh my god
yeah and you suppress it well you&#39;re in
big trouble i&#39;m telling you you&#39;re in
big trouble
you just destroyed your life you
destroyed your relationship with your
spouse you destroyed
everything because you just blocked the
flow of your energy with this thing you
down there suppression is the worst
thing you can ever do
understand that all right or okay
i&#39;m gonna sit there and deal with it you
express it or do what the heck it is try
to fix it right
no the right thing to do is if something
comes up
to relax and release and what you&#39;ve
done then is allowed the room
for the cause to pass through you&#39;ll now
love your spouse more
you&#39;ll love everybody more because you
release the blockage
that caused the reaction am i does
anybody understand what we&#39;re talking
okay so this thing about the rope that&#39;s
right you&#39;re there you&#39;re conscious an
event takes place that triggers
you and all of a sudden you start to get
distracted starts to pull it&#39;s a pull
it&#39;s like a water scheme if you ever
water skied
the boat pulls you that&#39;s what this
distraction does it pulls your
consciousness toward it
relax relax and release i call it r
r you need some r r right you relax and
and what will happen is the energy will
not pull the consciousness out
and you will have transcended and
transmuted the power of that energy now
you listen to me
right i&#39;m literally saying the power
that that had over you
when you are able to relax your way
through it that power comes back to self
every single time and it builds the
power of self
next time your will will be a hundred
times stronger than it was this time
do you understand that all right so
you&#39;re either giving your will
to what&#39;s pulling on it if you if if
you&#39;re trying to stop drinking
every single time you don&#39;t drink you
are more likely to not drink
do you understand that every time oh but
i had a bad day
you get made it through it you didn&#39;t do
it you built the power of will
in the power of self and likewise every
single time you do drink after
five years of not drinking you got all
your chips together
go have one drink and tell me how easy
the second one is
does anybody understand the power of not
doing it that you built over five years
is almost totally overcome by drinking
go ask aa they&#39;ll tell you the same
thing goes with any of these habits
because your neural pathways are carved
to do it
if you re-feed them they flow right back
there so it&#39;s the same thing here
if you are willing to let go that&#39;s what
i&#39;m talking about the deepest state
i&#39;m in the witness i see what&#39;s going on
i&#39;ve been given the grace at first it&#39;s
just a moment just a moment
but no one can tell me that they do not
see what&#39;s going on
i did 30 years of prison work those are
not exactly the most self-controlled
every one of max security murder rape
everything that&#39;s they&#39;re in there for
life okay
and we would talk like this and every
one of them
everyone told me that before they did
what they did
there was a moment in which they were
perfectly aware
of what they were about to do if they
started getting angered and just all of
a sudden be there it starts somewheres
it starts to build up and then it
explodes you deal with it the moment it
shows up
let go and then you come tell me what&#39;s
going to happen to you because i&#39;ll see
it in your eyes
the power that it had over you gets
transmuted to you
to the self and all of a sudden this
tremendously
powerful center of being is what exists
and all of a sudden if if you do it with
you&#39;ve the power you built in letting go
of jealousy is there for food it&#39;s there
for this it&#39;s fair for everything
you&#39;re building the power of your being
that&#39;s why he&#39;s talking about personal
growth all right this is the
the talk about you know when you work
out to talk about core building the core
of your being
this is the core of your being now
you&#39;re doing core workout you&#39;re
building the center of your being
to be strong enough to let go
of the pull that these habits and
tendencies
have over you every single time you let
a piece of those rocks that are causing
disturbance
are purified and this is real spiritual
growth and this is yoga
right the reason you do all your
practices is to learn to sit in the seat
and let go well how often do i let go
every single time
but aren&#39;t there times i need to deal
with something that&#39;s what you want to
say don&#39;t you
didn&#39;t they die they need to deal with
something of course there are times you
need to deal with something
but you don&#39;t deal with what&#39;s outside
until you&#39;ve dealt with what&#39;s inside
if you don&#39;t let go first of your anger
your jealousy your insecurity your fear
your need
then everything you&#39;re going to be doing
outside is for you
understand that if i&#39;m attracted to you
right and i say i have to deal with that
i have an attraction you&#39;re not dealing
with that you&#39;re dealing with your
attraction it&#39;s going to run your life
it&#39;s going to determine what you say
what you don&#39;t say
right or wrong same thing with your
fears and insecurities if you don&#39;t let
inside the inside will run the outside
does everybody see that
i always use a terrible example your
kid&#39;s 16 years old you get a call from
the principal
in the high school we found drugs in
your kid&#39;s locker
you need to come down here right away
blah blah okay well
that&#39;s not fun is it it&#39;s exactly what
i&#39;m talking about it&#39;s the same thing
all your junk comes up inside what did i
do oh my god my husband finds out
he&#39;s already thought well our
relationship is bad he&#39;s going to blame
right or wrong okay whatever the
neighbors think oh my god if i have to
go down there people will see me
they&#39;ll see me in the principal&#39;s office
and i don&#39;t want to have a kid that does
drugs and
oh my god this is all right not a single
word that went on inside you had
anything to do with that child
it all had to do with you right or wrong
it hit your stuff
okay what what did i do wrong that&#39;s
what you say to the kid
what did i do wrong why&#39;d you do this to
me that&#39;ll help a lot
right you&#39;re not even trying to help the
kid you&#39;re trying to help yourself
you understand that so when it hits it&#39;s
going to come up inside
you always let go nobody believes me you
always let go always there is
never ever a time that the highest
dharmic right thing to do is not let go
all right okay here it comes here&#39;s all
the personal garbage
do the best you can to let go of
yourself every single time
now what now that you are clear
clearer anyways all right now then it&#39;s
not perfect you&#39;re not going to be
perfect but at least you didn&#39;t go with
the initial reaction
you stayed centered and clear now that
you are clear
look outside is there something to deal
not that something to deal with is you
you don&#39;t ever deal with you
the only way to transcend the personal
self is to transcend the personal self
there&#39;s nothing to do about it what do i
do about it nothing you let it go
it&#39;s all right if it&#39;s inside of you let
it go let it go
that way you&#39;re using it to go to god
every single thing you let go of now how
the bigger it is the better
and you just keep letting go now if you
look outside and it&#39;s still there
now sally not saying hello when you&#39;re
done with letting go of your insecurity
sadly not there anymore there is nothing
to do
i&#39;m telling you my experience is 95
of these situations there&#39;s nothing to
do it&#39;s just that it hits your stuff
all right and if you let it go there&#39;s
nothing to do you know
well what if sally&#39;s mad at me you&#39;ll
find out later
what if she didn&#39;t hear me no one will
find out it does doesn&#39;t matter
it&#39;s completely irrelevant the only
problem was you how&#39;s that
right if the only problem is you let it
go it&#39;s much easier
it&#39;s great not only was it easier and
better for sally and your relationship
but it actually took you to god because
you let go of a piece of the garbage
that got hit
it is always the highest thing to do
to let go do you understand that right
you&#39;re relaxed and you&#39;re released it&#39;s
not easy is it
right that stuff that&#39;s getting hit got
stored down there
because you didn&#39;t like it when it
happened remember you pushed it away
if it was stored with pain i am telling
you it is coming back up with pain
let&#39;s get this straight right there&#39;s no
can&#39;t i purify it can&#39;t the guru come
down and purify it so it&#39;s beautiful i
love the guru i worship all the time
all right literally mayor baba actually
talked about that
that amazing he was an amazing being
the disciple raised his hand and said
but mayor bob you&#39;re talking about
getting rid of all this stuff the cocoon
of karma that&#39;s built inside the same
scar exceeds
why can&#39;t the master just come down with
a scissor
and cut the cocoon and free the soul
there you go that was a good idea all
right and he answered very sternly and
he said first of all the master can do
anything if it&#39;s truly a master merge
with god he has all the power in the
universe he would
never ever do it under any circumstances
because then you did not evolve enough
which is the purpose of life
you did not evolve enough to liberate
therefore you didn&#39;t come back to god
you&#39;re not strong enough you didn&#39;t go
that&#39;s like sitting there saying well
i&#39;m in third grade
and i want to go to harvard and get a
law degree okay
could they give me the certificate
well they could but i don&#39;t want to go
for to you as a lawyer
like there&#39;s this thing called learning
that&#39;s supposed to happen in between you
understand that evolving
that&#39;s the exact same thing with the
soul so it&#39;s not
about the stuff not hurting it&#39;s about
you weren&#39;t able to handle it when it
happened you couldn&#39;t handle the salary
and say hello come on give me a break
there&#39;s seven billion people on the
planet earth they didn&#39;t say hello to
but you couldn&#39;t handle one of them all
right that&#39;s how you have to look at it
so there&#39;s something
there&#39;s something wrong with sally that
you didn&#39;t say hello there&#39;s nothing
wrong with me
that i can&#39;t handle the most simple
things in the whole world
correct all right so you let it go you
use it
wisely and you release it if you will do
this like i said
you will find that you stay centered
what does that mean i don&#39;t get pulled
away by the distraction now you have a
definition what it means to be centered
the consciousness remains in the seat of
even though a distracting event took
place and began to pull on it
it came back to its center it didn&#39;t go
all the way out
it started to go out it&#39;s like whoop
that&#39;s what it feels like inside
whoop right it starts to pull out you
relax you don&#39;t pull it back i&#39;m telling
you don&#39;t try to be stronger
than the noise that&#39;s distracting you
the key is to relax
if you relax you stay that neat
it is the relaxation that does it so you
through these disturbances every one you
relax through
makes you stronger for any other one and
eventually
i shouldn&#39;t tell you this right it&#39;s not
that there&#39;s this one moment
that something starts to distract you it
all gets into slow motion at a level
absolutely ridiculous it feels like you
have 10 hours to decide
am i going to go out there i spent years
and years i&#39;ve invested look what i&#39;ve
sometimes you&#39;ll get to the point where
you realize i let go of 7 000 things for
all these years
now something bigger happened am i
willing to give up
the pain the strength the work i did
of letting go of 7 000 for this one
that you see why i use the analogy of
alcoholism of a
i got chips five years worth of chips
now i got this situation
am i really willing to give all that up
that i did what i went through
exercising that will
because this one thing is stronger and
you&#39;ll start finding that you know
you want to build on your investment so
then goes into slow motion and all of a
sudden you have all the time you need
and then only a fool only a fool would
consciously say ah but the hell i&#39;ll do
it anyways
i&#39;m serious your mind will sit there and
say well i don&#39;t want to be a
goody-goody i just sit there and what&#39;s
wrong with this is a good opportunity so
opportunity we&#39;ll come back later
right i can just go do this and have a
drink i want you to equate it the going
with the energy that&#39;s pulling you from
your center
i want you to equate it to going back on
heroin after you went through withdrawal
and got off
i went now bigger than drinking okay
it&#39;s like really
you really want to do that do you
because i&#39;m telling you
if you go with that energy right you
will have given up
it if it takes a 100 to not go with it
once you go with it it offsets 600.
i&#39;m serious i&#39;m not exaggerating ask a.a
if you stop drinking ten times and then
you take one
it totally offsets the ten times
completely and utterly
doesn&#39;t it okay so you learn
to work with your center i&#39;ve taken you
to a beautiful place which is i&#39;m in
i&#39;m aware that i have crap in here with
me how about you
right and it can get hit that&#39;s stuff
you stored from before
it was stored with pain i wasn&#39;t able to
handle it when it happened
it&#39;s going to come back up am i capable
of handling it now
so sally went by now i hear the word
sally obviously is not as big as the
first time
but i feel the discomfort the slightest
discomfort i will not accept
any not a tinge of it if it moves
i&#39;m letting it go if it happens in the
heart or it happens in the mind
first reaction relax and release
right then look to see is there
something i&#39;m supposed to deal with
if there is still something out there
then you&#39;re
clear enough to deal with what&#39;s out
there instead of being distracted about
what&#39;s going on inside of you
does anyone hear me all right if you are
distracted what&#39;s going on inside of you
i don&#39;t want to be around when you&#39;re
dealing with less outside because you&#39;re
not dealing with what&#39;s outside
you&#39;re trying to manipulate the outside
to make you feel better inside
aren&#39;t you okay so basically you
learn this practice this is your
spiritual practice what letting go
when always every single second the
driver in front of you
is driving too slow let go been behind
you beeped you were sitting there
at the traffic light you&#39;re looking at
your little smartphone and you didn&#39;t go
with the traffic
right i mean really obnoxious it was
only two seconds of obnoxious beat all
stuff&#39;s gonna come up and then right
you&#39;re gonna say something to that guy
he don&#39;t hear you
you know you hear a word all right
nothing going on in there right
let it go there&#39;s an excellent
opportunity
you understand that you&#39;re you&#39;re
driving you need to deliver something
and it starts pouring and you have no
time frame you have to get there
and it&#39;s raining and there&#39;s nothing you
can do you are going to get wet
let it go let well go like getting wet
you wish you could
let go of the resistance to the reality
of the situation that&#39;s in front of you
do you hear what i&#39;m saying why not why
do you want this garbage and i know i
talking to me and always reigns i have
to go somewhere god doesn&#39;t like me
what are you doing let it go it&#39;s not a
work with yourself constantly
relentlessly
a yogi works with themselves every
single second you work with yours you
work with everybody else every second
everybody it&#39;s a full-time job to get
everybody to be the way you want
isn&#39;t it right you&#39;re out there
manipulating controlling doing anything
instead you work with yourself and you
just keep letting go and wait do you see
what happens i&#39;m telling you what will
happen i
laid it out i&#39;ve never talked to you
this way before i&#39;ve laid it out for you
at first it&#39;s hard right because you
want to fix it
either suppress it or fix it right no
you&#39;ll learn to do it you&#39;ll practice
just like learn a piano or learn to play
practice practice just practice don&#39;t
get hard on yourself don&#39;t worry if
it fails right what if you play any
piano you make a mistake i don&#39;t want to
well that&#39;s ridiculous right it&#39;s good
means you need to learn things right if
you sit there and you&#39;re trying to let
go and also you didn&#39;t
you get caught somewhere and you like oh
my god i should have let that go
don&#39;t get guilty don&#39;t get this just you
were practicing the piano and you made a
just get back up say next time i&#39;ll be a
little wiser next time all right and it
helps you
you just keep letting go your whole life
every single second
and then like i said what will happen is
you&#39;ll get used to
feeling from inside this tendency to for
the consciousness to be
drawn away from the center toward the
distraction i love that i taught you
that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening it&#39;s being
pulled toward the loudest distraction
relax it&#39;ll come back relax it&#39;ll come
back and every time it comes back
the power of the distraction gets
invested into the seat itself
and all of a sudden your center you
can&#39;t even talk about it you become
what&#39;s called the being of power
and you feel it that power you build
this is shakti you&#39;re building the power
being of yourself back to the center of
well if i start coagulating and
consolidating power in one place
it gets powerful doesn&#39;t it all right
and you&#39;ll that&#39;s where all the power
comes from so sure healing comes from
where shaktipat comes from
everything comes from it&#39;s from building
that center and
not letting pieces of it get drawn away
by the distractions
doesn&#39;t mean you have to go into the
mallus and not get distracted
i would rather have you work in your
everyday life and not get distracted
i&#39;m not impressed if you can go into a
sensory deprivation cave
and not be distracted right i&#39;m
impressed if you can stay in your
everyday life and not be distracted
by this garbage going on inside of you
and the growth is way better too
you understand that this is how you use
every moment of your life to go to god
it&#39;s fun in it all of a sudden it&#39;s this
exciting journey
of transcending yourself as opposed to
getting what yourself want so you don&#39;t
have to transcend yourself
it&#39;s happening now your needs your
desires your liking and dislikes
are the reflection of where you&#39;re
caught something bothered you before
saying that something happened doesn&#39;t
bother you
you saw somebody had a nicer car than
you and the girl or guy went with them
in high school and all of a sudden you
got this thing about a nice car
it&#39;s just you&#39;re just reliving your
garbage with your likes and dislikes
instead you relax and release reaction
release reaction release relax release
all right then it will build your center
like we talked about
and it gets stronger and stronger and
eventually you will reach a point
where the joy the love the power
is feeding you from inside and there&#39;s
nothing that can come in from outside
that&#39;s more beautiful than what&#39;s going
on inside every one of you have that
right yogananda said there is a river of
flowing inside of you find it go there
get in and drown that&#39;s yoga this is how
you find it
that&#39;s how do i find it don&#39;t go looking
for it don&#39;t get a map all right
you like a keep that don&#39;t understand i
want to know letting go you see the
power of that
the power of relaxing and releasing to
allow the chi the shakti to build back
into your center
and then eventually it starts flowing up
that&#39;s what it does because you&#39;re not
going with the pull down it changes
direction literally changes direction
and starts flowing up and feeding you
now if you&#39;re smart
you realize this is more beautiful than
anything i ever experienced
i&#39;m gonna hang out with this and now you
really really building a center inside
yourself and you would never let it
let anything take it away from you and
then it gets stronger it just does
nothing but get stronger all the time
and eventually it gets so strong what
does the joy the beauty
the bliss the ecstasy flowing up inside
of you
that you can&#39;t stand it literally
can&#39;t stand in his presence it starts
pulling you into it
you&#39;re not doing anything it&#39;s not an
act of meditation
it&#39;s just pulling you into it it&#39;s so
that you want to just melt you don&#39;t
want to exist you want to just
melt into it now you&#39;re being pulled
into the higher states you fall into a
breathless state with that going on
now that&#39;s very honorable you understand
that because you&#39;re purified
those states don&#39;t come and go now you
become that&#39;s where the great masters
they merged they just released the
personal completely
and now of christ saying my father and i
are one so it
notice i started with the personal
garbage that&#39;s what you get from this
i started with the dirty stuff didn&#39;t i
your laundry and we ended up in god
but permanently in god not some
experience i had
it&#39;s my state of being because you let
go of the rest
so this is quote i&#39;ve talked to you
about which is i&#39;ve never really talked
to you this way before right
that is called the evolution of the soul
that entire process i just talked to you
is the evolution of the soul it is
becoming stronger and stronger and
because it&#39;s able to let go of what was
pulling it down
it becomes healthier and healthier and
eventually there&#39;s not a single thing in
this world
nothing which had to show i&#39;m to mcgee
in the morning there&#39;s a line that says
the man that has tasted the bliss of the
may move amongst objects of sense
without fear his mind never clings to
the world&#39;s misery
his heart is with god and his soul is
set free how&#39;s that sound
like what we just talked about all right
and you it&#39;s called
jivan mukta you&#39;re now a liberated being
you are beautiful beautiful people you
wouldn&#39;t be here right
you turn to yoga you turn to easter
teaching turn to meditation that&#39;s
really beautiful
never forget what we just talked about
because that is the evolution of your
soul that&#39;s the reason you took birth on
this plane
earth is a place that souls are sent to
you understand that so this is what
you&#39;re doing you&#39;re doing your dharma
people say what&#39;s my dharma i just told
that&#39;s your dharma the rest will happen
naturally by itself
