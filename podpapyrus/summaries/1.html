              <li>Trump said he wants to eliminate mail-in ballots through an executive order before the 2026 midterms.</li>
              <li>He claimed mail-in ballots are inherently corrupt and make real democracy impossible.</li>
              <li>He argued the U.S. is basically the only country that uses them, which is not true.</li>
              <li>He also attacked voting machines as inaccurate and overly expensive.</li>
              <li>Trump said paper ballots with watermarks are the only trustworthy method.</li>
              <li>He repeated his belief that Democrats only win because of "cheating" with mail-in voting.</li>
              <li>After meeting with Putin, he claimed Putin told him U.S. elections are rigged due to mail voting.</li>
              <li>Putin supposedly said Trump actually won 2020 and that war in Ukraine wouldn't have happened otherwise.</li>
              <li>Commentators pointed out that Trump himself has voted by mail in the past.</li>
              <li>Many countries around the world do in fact use mail-in ballots successfully.</li>
              <li>Critics say Trump's real goal isn't changing the system but planting doubt ahead of midterm results.</li>
              <li>Republicans historically did better in low-turnout elections, while mail-in voting raises turnout.</li>
              <li>That makes Trump's strategy questionable from a tactical point of view.</li>
              <li>There's concern he's setting up to claim the midterms were "rigged" if Republicans lose ground.</li>
              <li>He even joked about canceling elections during wartime, raising worries about abuse of emergency powers.</li>
              <li>Trump has shown off Trump 2028 campaign merchandise, hinting at staying a political force well past 2024.</li>
              <li>Analysts think he may prefer being a "kingmaker" rather than actually serving again as president.</li>
              <li>He has also floated the idea of a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants.</li>
              <li>The Constitution says representation is based on the "whole number of persons," not just citizens.</li>
              <li>Legal experts doubt such a census change could happen quickly, but the proposal fits into the larger effort to tilt the playing field.</li>
