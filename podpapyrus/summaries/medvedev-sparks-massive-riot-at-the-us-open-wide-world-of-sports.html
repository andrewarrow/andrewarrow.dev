advantage. Bunsie
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; match point. Bonsie,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; please.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait, please. Not now. Get off the
court, please.
First serve, ladies and gentlemen.
Because of the delay caused by an
outside interference,
first serve has been granted.
Don&#39;t shake. It&#39;s okay. Are you a man?
Are you a man?
Don&#39;t shake. Why you shaking?
Why you sh
And it&#39;s a first serve. You want to go
home? He wants to go home, guys. He
doesn&#39;t like to be here. He gets paid by
the match, not by the hour. Yeah.
What did Riley Aelka say? What did Riley
say? What did
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let&#39;s play.
He&#39;s just totally lost control of his
emotions, says Medb.
[Applause]
Don&#39;t know what that cameraman was
but uh the upshot of it all is that
it&#39;ll be a first serve for Bonsi.
[Applause]
I&#39;ve ever seen anything like it.
ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bonsi is ready
to serve. Please.
I can understand me feeling hard done
by, but he has completely lost control
of his emotions here.
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
I don&#39;t know why the cameraman came out
of the pit and walked on the court
whilst the match was still ongoing, but
this is just a result of all the
frustrations of not only the last two
hours, but I think the last couple of
Bonsi&#39;s been the better player.
And I&#39;m not sure that having a first
serve is going to make that much of a
difference to the outcome here.
The fans feeling like they want to get
their money&#39;s worth.
And of course, it is a first serve.
That&#39;s what all the hoopla was about.
Second serve is the chance.
It&#39;s about 4 and 1/2 minutes since that
cameraman made his move onto the court
between first and second serve.
And of course it was off the back of
that that Greg Allenssworth gave Bonsi a
first serve because of the disruption
that took place and then
the disruption has continued since
pretty much incited the crowd to get
No, I&#39;m not I&#39;m not paying. I&#39;m just
going to the line and then going. I&#39;m
not paying
Yeah, he&#39;s starting this. This should be
tempation.
I&#39;ve never seen a situation ladies and
[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on making the point that he didn&#39;t
create this situation so he doesn&#39;t feel
he should be rushed into hitting the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
This is unbelievable. Almost six
[Applause]
If he misses the first serve, it could
be the biggest cheer of the night.
[Applause]
It is match point for Benjamin Bonsi.
It&#39;s like a riot out here.
Okay, one deep breath. Here we go. Oh.
You called it, Colin.
