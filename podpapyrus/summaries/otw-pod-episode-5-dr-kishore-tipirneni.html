<li>Dr. Kor Tippernini is an orthopedic surgeon from Phoenix, Arizona who was born in India and immigrated to the US at age 4</li>
<li>He originally wanted to pursue computer science at MIT but was convinced by his father to try the 6-year medical program instead</li>
<li>Despite having no initial interest in medicine, he became passionate about programming and taught himself BASIC and machine language in high school</li>
<li>He never studied textbooks and relied on attending classes and absorbing information, similar to his father's learning style</li>
<li>His first startup, Remote Image, was created out of necessity when he couldn't view X-rays from home during on-call duties</li>
<li>He developed a digital camera system to photograph X-rays and upload them to a secure website for remote viewing</li>
<li>The company was quickly acquired by investors and evolved into E-Trauma, then later became Office PACS, the #1 digital imaging company in orthopedics</li>
<li>He is also a successful author who wrote a sci-fi trilogy exploring the concept that life is essentially data, selling around 100,000 books</li>
<li>His latest venture, Tempa, is an AI-powered medical documentation system designed to eliminate the burden of EMR documentation</li>
<li>Tempa uses three AI components: transcription (AIScribe), note customization (AI Editor), and EMR integration (AI Autopilot)</li>
<li>The system achieves 99% accuracy in transcription and allows physicians to customize notes through "macros" or plain English instructions</li>
<li>One key feature helps reduce insurance denials by automatically justifying ordered tests and procedures in clinical notes</li>
<li>Since using Tempa, he reports zero peer-to-peer insurance reviews (previously 1 per week) and 30-40% increase in patient volume</li>
<li>The platform offers 100 free minutes for trial (approximately 20 patient visits) and charges based on audio processing time</li>
<li>Tempa works across all medical specialties and can handle complex multi-provider workflows including PAs and MAs</li>
<li>His advice for entrepreneurs: have the entire process mapped out mentally, be prepared for failure and pivoting, and maintain passion for the project</li>
<li>He emphasizes that failure is part of the entrepreneurial process and provides valuable learning experiences for future ventures</li>
<li>The system allows physicians to see patients without any electronic devices in the room, using only an Apple Watch or iPhone to record</li>

Today my guest is orthopedic surgeon Dr.
Kor Tippernini from Phoenix, Arizona. So
Thank you. Thanks for having me, Drew.
Absolutely. No, it&#39;s a pleasure. So, um,
I was excited to do this podcast for a
variety of reasons. Um, one, I&#39;ve I&#39;ve
known you for some time, um, and had
some experience with you, but the more
I&#39;ve gotten to know you and heard some
more of the little backstory on you, the
more fascinating I find you to be. Um,
so maybe you could just kind of give us
a little bit about kind of where you
were born and raised and give us some
context to the family that that you grew
up in.
Yeah, so I was actually born in India.
Um my dad was a doctor and um during the
Vietnam war there was a shortage of
physicians in the United States. So he
was invited uh to come to the United
States as a as an immigrant and he came
uh when I was uh 3 and a half years old.
Um but it was just him and my mom that
came and so me and my brother were
stayed in India for 6 months and then
after 6 months uh in January actually of
71 uh I came to the United States just
me and him uh me a four-year-old him a
2-year-old on on a plane by ourselves
from India and landing in JFK and
feeling cold for the very first time in
our life and we&#39;re like what is this and
actually seeing Caucasian people for the
first time like what this is like going
to a different world. Yeah. So
interesting. Wow.
So, so then you were raised in uh was it
Ohio, you said, or where?
So, initially we were in Flint,
Michigan, where my dad did his uh
internship and then Youngsttown, Ohio,
where he did his residency in anesthesia
and then uh grew up pretty much in
Columbus, Ohio.
Okay, that&#39;s great.
So, what&#39;s so fascinating to me was
hearing the story about you basically
being a almost an accidental orthopedic
surgeon. So, why don&#39;t you give us a
little bit of insight into what what you
were passionate about and how you ended
So, back in the mid 80s when personal
computers were first coming out, one of
my friends had gotten one and I was
playing around with it and of course,
you know, back then we&#39;re all playing
video games and that kind of stuff and
I&#39;m like, I thought this is the coolest
thing ever and I kept bugging my dad to
get me a computer and he&#39;s like, no, no,
no. And finally, he&#39;s like, why do you
want a computer? And I&#39;m like, &#34;Well,
can&#39;t tell him I&#39;m gonna play video
games on it, but I said, &#34;I need it for
my homework,
of course.&#34;
And uh so I get it. He goes, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll
get you a computer, but you&#39;re not
allowed to buy any games for it.&#34; And so
I get the computer. I&#39;m like, &#34;Okay, I
don&#39;t even know how to use this thing.&#34;
But it came with a programming manual.
It was an Apple 2 computer. And I taught
myself basic uh in order to program my
own video games because he didn&#39;t say I
couldn&#39;t make my own. So I got really
good at basic. I love the creative
aspects of of programming and coding
because you can tell it what to do and
it actually does it. It&#39;s kind of an
interesting thing. And then um uh basic
was too slow. So I taught myself machine
language or assembler when I was in high
school and I got pretty good at coding
and um eventually actually got a job at
Ohio State University programming for
them uh when I was in high school. But,
um, in Ohio, they had this six-year med
program where you get accepted into
medical school out of high school, and
you go six years, uh, two years of
undergrad and four years of med school,
and you get your MD in six years. And my
dad wanted me to apply for that. And I
pretty much had no interest in that. I&#39;m
like, I don&#39;t want to go to medicine. I
actually wanted to do computer science
at MIT or something like that. And he,
my dad never trusted computers. He&#39;s
like, man, this is like some kind of toy
back then. So, of course, they didn&#39;t
understand like the power of what that
was going to be.
So he had me apply to that program. Then
I got in and and he&#39;s like, &#34;Oh my god,
you got in. I can&#39;t believe it. We&#39;re
going to go out and celebrate.&#34; I told
him, I said, &#34;I&#39;m not going.&#34;
He goes, &#34;What do you mean you&#39;re not
going? I&#39;m not going to.&#34; He goes, &#34;I&#39;m
not going to accept this.&#34; And and he&#39;s
like, &#34;Why don&#39;t you want to go?&#34; I
said, &#34;I have no interest in medicine. I
wanted to do software and this kind of
thing.&#34; And he kind of sat me down. I
said, &#34;I tell you what, try it out for a
year. If you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll let you
switch over and do your computer science
stuff.&#34; And I said, &#34;Sounded fair.&#34; So I
did. until you&#39;re 18, you get to
college, you got a ton of friends are in
the six-year program. There&#39;s only 35 of
us at Akran that were accepted to that
program. And you got to be really good
friends with them, and the education
stuff was almost secondary. So, 3 years
into the six-year program, I realized,
well, I guess I&#39;m going to be a doctor.
I better figure out what kind of doctor
I want to be. And so, I decided on
orthopedics. And uh, you know, that&#39;s
kind of how I became an orthopedic
So, how many
So, how many years? So you had six years
of college right out of high school. So
you&#39;re 24 when you graduate from med
So did you have to go do a residency in
orthopedics? How did you how did you end
up as an orthopedic surgeon?
So yeah, you had to apply for orthopedic
surgery residency which was very still
is very competitive. Um I think I
interviewed at like six or seven
different places and I got my third
choice which was at Henry Ford Hospital
in Detroit. And so it&#39;s weird. Match day
is a weird thing in medical school. you
you know Monday is a what they call
non-match day which is where you get
called from the med school if you didn&#39;t
match anywhere and Wednesday is match
day where they actually tell you like
where you match and where you&#39;re going
to go and our med school rented out this
bar and like you know had this whole
production and they&#39;d call your name up
and they&#39;d hand you an envelope and then
you open up the envelope like I open up
mine I&#39;m like oh my god I&#39;m going to
Detroit for six year five years so I was
like you know you&#39;re kind of a little
bit in shock but yeah that&#39;s how so I
ended up at 5 years at Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit my orthopedic
surgery residency there.
So, somebody told me, and I want to hear
it from you, that you didn&#39;t have to
study in school. Is that true?
Yeah. Yeah. I think I got that from my
dad, but my cousins used to tell me the
same thing about my dad in med school.
He&#39;s like, &#34;Dude, this guy never cracked
open a book. He&#39;d went go to class and
just absorb it and just, you know,
stuff.&#34; So, I never I never read a
textbook either.
So, you must be a really good listener
Yeah. I think that I mean, I always went
to class. I would sit near the front and
just to pay attention and take some
notes and stuff, but I would never like
textbooks. I&#39;m like,
for me, I think doing well in school is
about weeding out what information is
important, what isn&#39;t.
So, text textbooks have so much
information in them. It&#39;s like, you
know, you get kind of get a little bit
more confused even by reading that
stuff. So, I just absorb it and, you
know, maybe do a little bit of reference
in them, but that&#39;s about it. Yeah.
Yeah. It&#39;s funny. I&#39;ve actually heard
other people say that same thing. You
just got to know what as you&#39;re studying
what&#39;s important and what&#39;s going to be
on the test,
Because you can sort of game the system
that way.
So interesting. So you became an
orthopedic surgeon, moved out to
That&#39;s when I that&#39;s when I first met
And so your practice was general
orthopedics pretty much.
Yep. I didn&#39;t do a fellowship, so I was
doing general orthopedics. Uh, and when
I first started, it was with a group
that was they had a capitated contract
and I was just on salary because I&#39;m
just like happy to like actually be an
orthopedic surgeon. So, this capitated
contract meant that the group made the
same amount of money for those whatever
those patients no matter what we did for
them. So, I would see all these
capitated patients that were like and I
was doing a crapload of surgery and just
doing a ton of work um during that time
and I didn&#39;t care. I was just happy to
be operating and all that kind of stuff.
And um so I you know pretty good at
orthopedics and so I had you know
started building a practice pretty
quickly. Um but during that time also
even through residency all that stuff I
kept up with the computer stuff. Uh I
finally got a computer when I was in
residency I used to write code to do
what we call sharewware. I&#39;m not sure if
you remember that but it was like you
put it out on the internet right when
the internet first come out and people
can download an app and then sometimes
they&#39;d send you five bucks or 10 bucks
in the mail and it was kind of a hobby.
So, one of the things that I&#39;ve observed
about you is you&#39;re just like a super
intense efficiency expert. It&#39;s like
everything that you that you do, you&#39;re
very pragmatic and you look for ways to
create efficiencies and optimize your
your workflows.
And so,
um, talk about your first startup and
what how that came to be.
Yeah. Part of efficiency for me probably
is comes out of laziness or a lack of
mental thought. I don&#39;t like not
thinking about something or just doing
busy work. That&#39;s like the worst thing
in the world for me. So it was right
after I started my practice in &#39;96,
maybe was around 98 where I was on call
for the ER one day and it was about
11:00 at night and you know they didn&#39;t
have digital X-ray back then. So, uh,
they called me from the hospital about a
kid that had a broken wrist, and I&#39;m
like trying to figure out, should I come
go in and set it tonight or is it
something I could see in the office
tomorrow? And the guy at the ER doctor
describing the X-ray to me just really
wasn&#39;t describing in a way that I could
tell that information. And I&#39;m like, I&#39;m
not going to be able to sleep thinking
about this kid. So, get up out of bed,
drive the hospital, half hour there,
find the X-ray, put it up. I didn&#39;t even
see the kid. I&#39;m like, it was just a
rotated film that&#39;s I didn&#39;t need really
need to see. And I said, &#34;Just put that
in a splint and I&#39;ll just see him in the
office tomorrow.&#34; And I drove home and I
just thinking laying awake saying I just
wasted an hour and a half of my time
because I couldn&#39;t see this image. And I
said, &#34;You know what? Kind of lazy.&#34; So
I bought a digital camera the next day.
This were right when digital cameras
were coming out. And I put up a picture
of whatever fracture and took a picture
of it with a digital camera. I&#39;m like,
&#34;Okay, this gives me a lot of
information that I need from home.&#34; And
then I wrote the software to take it off
the camera and put it up to a secure
website so I can view it from home. It
was just a very simple system. And I&#39;m
like, this thing is great. And I had
other doctors at the hospital. Hey, can
I get on that, too? The same thing. And
and then I decided, you know what? Maybe
I should start a company, try selling
this thing. And so I did. We started a
company called Remote Image. And I went
to one trade show. It was the OTAA
meeting. And all I had was a sign made
up at Kinko that said, &#34;View X-rays over
the internet.&#34; And they just showed them
how it worked. And we were the busiest
booth at that conference because every
one of these orthopedic surgeons had the
exact same problem. It&#39;s like, &#34;Oh yeah,
they told me it was a subtroke, but it&#39;s
actually an inner truck and this and
that.&#34; And you can&#39;t plan for surgery
without looking at the X-ray. And you
know, now it seems like quaint, but back
then you couldn&#39;t see the X-ray from
home. And so that was my original
company that I started. And I didn&#39;t
even have the company for 3 months. And
a group of investors called me like 2
months or 3 months after that conference
said, &#34;We want to buy your company.&#34; I&#39;m
like, what? I mean, it&#39;s not for sale.
So, we worked out a deal where they gave
me some money up front, but I ended up
with 20% of the new company. And that
company was called E Trauma. And this is
the interesting thing about
entrepreneurship. That product was
great. The surgeons loved it. They
everybody wanted in their hospital, but
by the time you got it through radiology
and the IT department at the hospital,
all this kind of stuff, it was so hard
to implement that we didn&#39;t sell a lot
of it. And and then so actually and this
is we&#39;re now right after the.com bubble
burst and the company was pretty much
going under it and I&#39;m like okay well at
least we tried it kind of thing but then
what happened was our practice what
wanted to go into digital x-ray were
switching from film to plane film x-rays
and there were a couple of companies
already doing that at the point that
were the market leaders and I looked at
their products I&#39;m like this is garbage
man I mean what is this is what we&#39;re
selling to orthopedics I can&#39;t believe
these two are the market leaders and I
called up my the guy that was involved
my original company said if I write the
software for a pack system for
orthopedics, would you guys want to sell
it? He&#39;s like, &#34;Yeah.&#34; So, it took me
six weeks to write the original pack
software for orthopedics, that was a
software we called office packs, and we
sold the digital equipment and all the
software and everything. And over the
next four years, that became the number
one digital imaging company in
orthopedics. And then, uh, it was
acquired by Striker in 2004.
H, that&#39;s pretty cool.
Yeah. So that uh that wasn&#39;t the end of
your entrepreneurial journey though, was
No. No. Um you know, after that, you
know, obviously I think I was 32 at the
time. So, you know, it&#39;s kind of weird
when you&#39;re working so hard doing
residency, you&#39;re not getting paid that
much. You&#39;re just working all those
hours. I did that six-year program. So,
literally, even then, I graduated on a
Sunday from high school, started school
on Monday. So, I really didn&#39;t have much
time off for like good 11, 12 years. And
you know, after that company gets sold,
you&#39;re like, &#34;Okay, I never wanted to do
orthopedics.&#34; I I don&#39;t hate it. I just,
it wasn&#39;t like my super passion. So, I
cut back to just working like two to
three days a week in orthopedics just to
do more entrepreneurial stuff. And I&#39;ve
done a bunch of different
entrepreneurial stuff since then. So,
So, um I&#39;ve also found out that you&#39;re
an author and you have particular
interest in writing about technology and
sci-fi. So tell me about the whole
trilogy and what how that&#39;s been and
what what all went into that.
Well, it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m kind of one
of these people that really understands
biology but also understands technology
at a deep level for both of them. And I
see the symmetry between the two. Um,
and I I had this idea for this novel,
for this story for like 10 years
probably. And I, you know, was never a
writer or anything. So I was like, I
kind of want to get it out to get this
idea. It&#39;s a mindboggling
kind of story and maybe I&#39;ll give you a
little bit of tidbit of it. Um,
you know, I always think deeply about
like what does this mean and
philosophical and stuff. So, you know,
there&#39;s a certain species of frog in
Canada called the wood frog and it&#39;s
just like any other ordinary frog. Uh,
it jumps around and all that kind of
stuff except because it lives in Canada
and the and the ground becomes frozen.
it becomes completely frozen along with
the ground. And then in the spring when
it gets warm again, it thaws out and
becomes a frog again. And I kept
thinking to myself, the frog when it&#39;s
in this frozen state, is it living or
dead? And I&#39;m like, I guess it&#39;s
neither. But then I started thinking,
okay, if I take the frozen frog and I
put it in a blender and chop it up into
mush now, is it living or dead? I&#39;m
like, it has to be dead. But then I&#39;m
thinking, what is actually changing the
frog between that living state and this
dead state? The atoms are the same. The
mass is the same. What&#39;s changed is the
arrangement of those atoms. The
arrangement before was ordered like a
frog, but afterwards it&#39;s randomized.
And then I start thinking, what is
arrangement? And because I know computer
science, I&#39;m like, well, arrangement is
actually data. It&#39;s position information
of the atoms of that frog. And so then
I&#39;m like, wait a second, is life
actually just data? Is biology just
data? If you think about there&#39;s a lot
of information stuff that happens in
biology is very similar to what happens
in computers. DNA replication is
replication of information across cells
when you have a server that&#39;s serving a
website&#39;s replicating that information
across all the browsers that are there.
So, so the there&#39;s so for me I thought
it&#39;d be great to have a story where if
you could transmit data
at instantaneous differences and I&#39;m
also into quantum physics and so there&#39;s
a a thing in quantum physics physics
called quantum entanglement and there&#39;s
a whole thing with Einstein couldn&#39;t
believe and all this kind of stuff but
anyhow they&#39;ve proved the quantum
entanglement is true and information can
be trans transmitted instantaneously
across quantumly entangled particles. So
that story was a story about life, the
interaction between life and data, how
we are kind of data and now that if you
can transmit data across the universe,
then you can transmit yourself across
the universe.
So, so I wrote that book and I just
self-published it on Amazon and you know
took a while for it to kind of take
hold. But I never advertised it really
and eventually like 6 months later it
became it was went up to the number four
uh bestseller on the sci-fi category for
Amazon. And then I had a whole following
of of people like, &#34;Oh my god, this is a
great story. You need to like, you know,
write some more. I want to see what
happens next.&#34; And so I turned it into a
trilogy and uh released over the next
two years released those other two
So how many books have you sold then on
I mean Amazon like a lot of its Kindle,
a lot of its actual books and stuff. I&#39;d
estimate around 100,000 or so.
And you did this all in your spare time
between programming and practicing
Well, see, there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a very
big parallel between programming and
writing because it&#39;s a creative
endeavor, right? Orthopedics is uh a
very technical endeavor, but it&#39;s not
very creative, right? It&#39;s not like, you
know, you got somebody with a bad knee
and you want to do an ear placement.
There&#39;s nothing creative about it. It&#39;s
just same thing case after case after
case. So I needed a creative outlet. I
always do.
So your first software startup was
created out of a just pure necessity.
You saw a a need. You were frustrated.
There was there was not there was a
clear inefficiency there. So here we are
in 2025. You have done it again. uh you
have created another software platform
and at just like the first one was
created to make the life of an
orthopedic surgeon
easier to reduce some of the frustration
and stress and unnecessary burden. So
introduce us to what you&#39;re doing
currently.
Yeah. So I mean I&#39;m I like to be a
problem solver, right? The problem I was
solving before was like I can&#39;t see this
image from home and I need to see it.
The problem I&#39;m solving now is a problem
that&#39;s cropped up and slowly gotten
worse in medicine or since we&#39;ve gone
digital as far as EMRs are concerned. It
used to be before we had electronic
medical records. We would just go in,
flip through a paper chart with a
patient, dictate our note, and then and
then somebody would transcribe and put
it in. It was very easy. You could
dictate walk in between rooms. Now, with
these EMRs and the amount of button
clicks for orders and everything else
and the documentation you have to do, it
takes us actually a lot longer now to
document patient visits than actually
seeing patients. And that&#39;s very
frustrating for us. For me, that&#39;s busy
work, right? That&#39;s the kind of stuff
that I don&#39;t like doing. That&#39;s why I
never studied a textbook in in in
college and stuff. And this type and it
takes away from your patient, right?
you&#39;re now typing on this computer or
going through something without actually
speaking to the patients. It it gives
for a bad experience. And as surgeons,
we love seeing, diagnosing, and taking
care of patients. When 50% of our time
now in clinic, and they&#39;ve done studies
on this, is actually not doing that.
It&#39;s actually doing documentation, then
there&#39;s something wrong there. And some
practices solve this problem by hiring
scribes that take care of all that
stuff. But scribes are a expensive and b
they&#39;re temporary. So you have to train
them like how you like your notes and
how you like your orders and stuff and
then three months later they&#39;re off to
med school or doing something else and
you have to train another one and so
it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not efficient. So I
wanted to see if I can build an AI
company that takes care of that. And
when I looked at the problem of that and
I wasn&#39;t the first one to to to come up
with the idea u I&#39;ve been working on
this for a couple years now. I think my
first solution to it was a kind of a
templatebased system that was a smart
template based system which worked well
for me because I spent three months
creating my templates and stuff. But
when I when we tried to sell that it was
like oh it was too ownorous for the
physicians to create their own templates
and stuff. I said okay then we need to
make it more seamless make it like
literally you just start within 10
minutes and you&#39;re good to go. And so I
looked into these systems that would uh
these what do we call them? these
ambient type systems that record audio
of a patient visit and then um Stacy
take that audio and create a note for
you. I uh one of my partners was using
one of those systems and I looked at it
and I said, &#34;What happens like if like
the patient&#39;s talking about something
that&#39;s nonclinical, right? Maybe they&#39;re
a friend of yours and they&#39;re asking you
about the kids and and that kind of
thing or whatever.&#34; And she was like,
&#34;Oh yeah, I got to go in and like edit
all that stuff out.&#34; And she was kind of
frustrated. She&#39;s she&#39;s just had a baby
and was trying to find some tools that
would give her more time with her kid
because you know when she was going home
she was doing all these charts and she&#39;s
like maybe this will help and and she
was like yeah really when I was using
this thing it didn&#39;t really help save me
that much time and I looked at the what
the problems was were with the existing
system. So one is that it&#39;s got to be
super contextually aware so it&#39;s so
smart that it understands this shouldn&#39;t
be in the note and this should be in the
note. Number two is any of these systems
that create a note, they&#39;re never
perfect, right? Every physician wants
their note and verbiage in their note
separately. So I needed to have a system
that can accommodate customality in this
then in a very quick fashion. And uh the
third thing is what to do about like
stuff that you don&#39;t actually physically
say when you&#39;re in a room. Like if I&#39;m
doing a cortisone injection on a
patient, there&#39;s a certain mi mixture
that I use and a certain procedure note
that I use on every single one. What
you&#39;re not saying that out loud when
you&#39;re talking to the patient. So the AI
doesn&#39;t have the context for that. I
wanted to solve all of those problems.
And the final problem was this.
Workflow-wise. Many physicians use a PA
or some other, you know, uh, provider.
They&#39;re probably taking a better history
than I will be because they&#39;re going to
come out and tell me that history and
I&#39;m just going to spend a shorter amount
of time with the patient discussing
diagnosis and treatment, but the AI
needs to know about both conversations
and how do you link both of those
together so that the AI knows the
complete context for that. And so with
those design criteria in mind, we
designed this thing from the ground up
to do exactly that. And that&#39;s where
that&#39;s what Tempe is now. We just
finally got approved by the app store uh
last week and it we&#39;re just starting to
launch it and I will tell you all my
partners are using it and it&#39;s weird the
first reaction that I see whenever they
see the first note that comes out of it
they&#39;re like oh my god this thing is so
good it&#39;s it&#39;s weird how smart it is and
how this is the way AI is supposed to
be. It&#39;s kind of like when people
started using chat GPT for the first
time. Well, we&#39;ve taken that kind of
concept and put it into medicine because
we know what physicians need.
Yes. When if when the uh all the ambient
platforms were coming out uh and spoken
to a number of them at different
conferences and it seemed as though you
know 88% accuracy was sort of the the
baseline of sort of how much you can
expect it to be on point from what was
actually spoken in the patient visit.
So, um, what you&#39;re saying and it sounds
like is that this is a lot more accurate
and this is going to
take that threshold up to a more
desirable level.
So, there&#39;s actually three different AIs
that work together in our system. The
first component is kind of what you&#39;re
talking about, that ambient type
technology that basically just listens
and then generates the note. I&#39;d say
that&#39;s like 99% accurate. Okay. Just
that alone. But see, you can&#39;t just stop
there, right? you you want to leverage
AI to really help the practice. And so
we take that node that comes out of the
first AI and run it through our LLM with
instructions from you on how to modify
that node from the physician. Right? For
example, some physicians may say, &#34;Hey,
give me the ICD10 and CPT codes for this
note and it&#39;s smart enough to do that.&#34;
Uh other physicians may say, &#34;Generate a
visit summary that&#39;s patient focused
that tells them, you know, what they
need to do before their next visit.&#34; Um
you can say say stuff like hey if I
prescribe a medication for this patient
list the common side effects uh uh for
the patient just like that it&#39;s just
single sentences that they now you&#39;re
leveraging the power of AI AI through an
LLM type mechanism that takes the
original note and remodifies it to
exactly what you want and that to be
honest with you is actually the more
powerful feature of our thing. One of my
macros is if I or this is we call them
macros, these instructions to the AI.
One of mine is um if I order a test or a
surgery, modify the text of the note to
reduce insurance denials. Okay, it&#39;s a
very generic type macro, but you should
see what this AI does with that. I&#39;m
just it justifies everything you do. He
says he I need to order MRI because a
patient has failed this conser
treatment, done this, done this, then
blah blah blah. It just puts in two or
three sentences after every single test
of exactly what needs to be there. It&#39;s
weird how good it is. Yeah. So, that&#39;s
the the real power of our system is the
front end getting the 99% correct, but
then taking that, imagine being able to
take a note, which you can&#39;t do right
now, maybe drop your entire note into
chat GPT and then tell chat GPT multiple
instructions on how to modify that note
and then that new note that comes back
is your final note. And that&#39;s kind of
what we&#39;ve done with this.
But it&#39;s all automated. So it&#39;s done the
first time and it&#39;s
right right. So so from the time you
upload the audio file to the time that
note comes back with all that stuff
added, all the LLM stuff added, it&#39;s
about 3 to four minutes.
So you just brought up a really a huge
pain point for physicians and that is
the whole peer-to-peer requirement to
get authorization, prior authorization.
Yep. Are you saying then that this you
expect that tempa will positively impact
those um those approvals?
Absolutely. I mean the the denial I mean
I don&#39;t to be honest with you I mean
we&#39;ve been using this I&#39;ve been using
this new version of Tempeda in my
practice for the past six weeks I would
say. I haven&#39;t had to do one
peerto-peer.
Not one?
What would you What was it before?
I&#39;d have to do like one a week for an
MRI or a surgery or something like that.
And so now you&#39;re doing none.
That&#39;s pretty uh it&#39;s pretty effective.
Yeah. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s going to be
100% effective and stuff, but
uh but it&#39;s a lot better than it was. It
reduces that that rate of denials by a
Yeah, that&#39;s just with one one macro. I
mean there there&#39;s other macros that we
use that are like, you know, it&#39;s funny
because the physicians that are using
it, we all, hey, I I just came up with
this great new macro and then we all
kind of share it and like, oh yeah, that
is good. I&#39;m going to use that, too. You
know, and yeah.
So, um I think right now, I mean, I&#39;ve
read a lot of articles over the past
several months about, and I actually did
a podcast with Dr. Brian Blackwood from
uh from Colorado um about six weeks ago
and he shared a personal story about
burnout and sort of the
the fact that so much of um so much was
demanded of him and trying to do
everything and still get home and be a
dad and husband and um and I know that
one of the one of the goals that you
have in in creating this platform was
for your own wellness, for your own.
To to alleviate that frustration that
you have when you constantly feel like
you&#39;re sucked into this interface with a
computer that is just pulling you away
from patient time or from personal time,
whether it&#39;s, you know, in clinic or
you&#39;re at home at the end of the day and
you&#39;re having to go read through and
make sure they&#39;re accurate. So,
can you speak to the effectiveness that
you believe that Tempa will deal with
some of that frustration and that
anxiety that physicians deal with when
they have to interface with the EMR all
the time?
Yeah. I mean, I think that to be honest
with you, it&#39;s it I&#39;m completely relaxed
now when I&#39;m seeing patients, right? It
used to be before, you know, you&#39;re
listening to their story or whatever,
taking the history and doing all the
physical exam and then you&#39;re going to
dictate or document it later and you
have to remember all that, right? First
of all, if you&#39;re not doing it right, I
used to do it right after I saw the
patient because if I do it at the end of
the day, I&#39;m not going to remember.
You&#39;ve seen 30, 40 patients a day. Are
you going to remember all the details
each of these patients? No. And so that
was like a little bit of like that&#39;s
stress trying to remember that stuff,
right? And second of all, you have
patients that are what I call
non-standard, right? The other day I saw
a patient for his knee and you know
whatever I ordered MRI, I thought it was
meniscus tear and like really at the end
I said, &#34;Okay, you have any questions?&#34;
and he&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, can you also take a
look at my wrist?&#34; And before Tempa, I
would have been like, &#34;Oh my god, this
is another template. I got to go through
all this other stuff and know, you know,
everything like that.&#34; And I&#39;m like,
&#34;Yeah, no problem.&#34; So, we talked about
his wrist, examined his wrist, and gave
him a diagnosis or what we should do
with it. And Temp is smart enough to
know where the history goes, where the
physical exam goes and assessment plan
goes. Even though it&#39;s not
chronologically correct,
I knew for a fact at the end of that all
that is going to get documented. I don&#39;t
have to worry about it. So, for me, it&#39;s
been a lot more pleasurable in clinic
seeing patients because I don&#39;t take
anything with me. The only thing I take
is my Apple Watch, which you know, you
can record on your iPhone or your Apple
Watch. I just take my Apple Watch and
hit record before I go into the room.
And I don&#39;t have anything electronic
with me in the office at all. It was
like the the old school days of doing
medicine with when you had to kind of
the paper chart or something like that.
I mean, so it&#39;s it&#39;s just a lot more
relaxing. And so I and and because I
don&#39;t have to do any of that
documentation, I mean, I probably see at
least 30 to 40% more patients now, more
relaxed than I did before.
In terms of the uh PA or MA, I mean, do
you have someone who&#39;s doing your I
mean, do you need someone that&#39;s helping
you in the in the practice?
I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t have a scribe. I
don&#39;t I don&#39;t have a PA. I mean, if I uh
if I was uh if my patient volume starts
increasing and stuff, I&#39;d probably get a
PA and stuff. I have worked with a PA in
the past at in a different practice. Uh
so, if you&#39;re in a a practice that
you&#39;re have a lot of patients, you&#39;re
busy and a lot of times the PAs will see
patients with the physicians. They&#39;ll
see a patient first sometimes. Sometimes
the physician will just see them by
themselves. But there&#39;s patients that
where the PA sees the patient first and
then reports to the physician and the
physician just goes in there and said,
&#34;Yeah, okay. whatever you need to be
able to capture that audio on that
patient from both the PA and the
physician and technologically we had to
make it seamless. So I&#39;m not going to be
handing my phone to my PA to record
anything. They have to be recorded on
their phone. Well, you have to be able
to sync the patient list between those
two phones to in order for that to
happen. So we had to build the
technology to allow that to happen. And
then we don&#39;t need the PA to be signed
up with Tempta, just the physician. So,
we have a a system set up where the
physician just displays a QR code on
their phone and the PA&#39;s phone just
scans it. Now, they&#39;re now these devices
are linked and they have the same
patient listen. Either of them can
record on any patient and the server
just combines the audio together before
processing it.
So then it just integrates both segments
into into one note.
Yeah. Because remember the first AI
component doesn&#39;t care about
chronological. It understands context.
So it knows where the history goes even
though the history there&#39;s part of the
history on one and part of the history
on the other. It knows about the and
just combines everything. It knows
understands it&#39;s very smart and
understands the content. It understands
Wow. So then just from uh performance
kind of a throughput you think it can it
can uh dramatically improve somebody&#39;s
patient volume if they and also reduce
at the same time reduce their
documentation time.
It&#39;s going to almost eliminate their doc
documentation time. Um and as far as
patient volume&#39;s concerned it depends on
the practice. If they are a busy
practice that has a wait list of
patients waiting to come in absolutely
it was it will increase volume
significantly increase volume because
now you&#39;re freeing the physician up to
do what they are trained to do see
diagnose and treat patients and that is
what we actually get paid for using CPT
codes we actually don&#39;t get paid for
documentation although it&#39;s it&#39;s a
necessary thing that we have to do so if
you get rid of the document or almost
eliminate the documentation I still
recommend everybody kind of review the
note before you put it in. But I I&#39;m
almost ch and I asked my partners who
are using this. I said, &#34;How often do
you have to change anything the note
that comes back?&#34; They&#39;re like, &#34;Almost
right?&#34; And so, so in that situation,
man, what what documentation? Now, you I
still do my orders in like ordering
tests and that kind of stuff, but but no
documentation at all.
And so if you&#39;re in a practice that uh
is busy and you have this weight list of
patients waiting to get in, you&#39;re
definitely going to see a huge increase
in revenue just because you&#39;re freeing
the physician up who&#39;s the one that that
makes the revenue from doing this this
this burden here.
Interesting.
So, um, what else would you say about
sort of this, uh, platform and and
encouragement to an orthopedic surgeon
who might be frustrated with any variety
of things that they&#39;re dealing with?
What what advice would you give them?
So, here&#39;s my advice I would give them.
Uh, I wanted I wanted to create
something that like when you use it for
the first time or even the second time,
you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh my god, this is great.&#34;
Okay. And so what we did is uh you can
create an account for free. You can
literally go on our website tempita.com.
Just hit sign up. You create an account
for free. We do require a credit card,
but we don&#39;t charge it because we give
you a and the way we charge for this
platform is by minutes of audio
processed. And by the way, our software
automatically removes all the silence in
an audio. So you don&#39;t get charged for
that. Um but you get 100 minutes free to
try it out. And when I looked at the
average number of minutes per clinic
visit throughout our practice, it&#39;s
around five minutes. Okay, you may
think, well, I&#39;d spend more than five
minutes with the patient. Yeah, but the
actual conversation time and the audio
time is ends up being around 5 minutes
if it&#39;s if it&#39;s removing all the
silence. So, so that&#39;s what it is. So,
you get 100 minutes free. So, that&#39;s
about what 20 patients you get to do use
for free. And then I know for a fact
that after you use it, you&#39;re like, &#34;Oh
my god, this is definitely worth
whatever it is.&#34; And so, that&#39;s what it
is. You just and there&#39;s no training.
Soon as you sign up, there is a
10-minute video that you watch that
teaches you everything you need to know
and then literally you can start using
it that day. There&#39;s no necessarily a
rep. You don&#39;t need to this this that
thing. No, it just needs needs to work
right out of the box and it does. And
I&#39;ve seen this with my own partners when
I uh they were kind of in the beta
testing stage and stuff and um and you
know, I was like, &#34;Hey, this is how it
works.&#34; So they didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t even
watch the training video and literally
after three or four patients, oh my god,
I get it.
And so does it integrate with the EMR or
do you just how does that work?
Yeah. So it can integrate with the EMR.
Uh there&#39;s remember I mentioned there&#39;s
three AI components. The first one is
the one that transcribes the audio to
text which we call AIcribe. The second
one which is the LLM that takes your
instructions and modifies that note. We
call that AI editor. And there&#39;s a third
component called AI autopilot. Autopilot
is it&#39;s a separate it&#39;s a Windows
application. By the way, our software
runs entirely in a web browser. So
there&#39;s no other software to download
for Scribe and editor. Um but the third
component is a Windows application that
basically uses another kind of AI
component called computer vision that
can actually see your screen and
recognize UI elements. So we train it on
your particular EMR to go through do all
the button clicks and the data entry
because it has the data from the editor
to auto enter that that that information
into your EMR. Now even if you and it
the autopilot takes a little bit of time
to kind of configure for your EMR, but
it doesn&#39;t need an interface for the
EMR. It works like a human that can
actually see the screen and does the
button clicks and all that stuff. But
even before autopilot is set up, uh, all
the text in the editor, uh, is copied to
the clipboard. So, you can just go into
your EMR and just paste it in.
In fact, most of my partners are just
doing that. They&#39;re not even using
autopilot like I am. So,
so serial entrepreneur,
author of best-selling book,
um, books, multiple books, a trilogy.
Um, so what advice would you give? I
know that a lot of the surgeons that um
that routinely listen to OTW or read the
articles, they there&#39;s a lot of them who
who are entrepreneurial that have great
ideas who
have a just a penchant to want to do
something different and take an idea
beyond an idea. So what what advice
would you give to someone who because I
know you&#39;ve also designed another
product and I the the uh cement punch
and that was another situation where
and maybe you can describe that cuz and
and maybe walk through the process of
how you
launched a product that came from your
head and and again fit a need that you
had clinically.
Yeah. So cement punch is just a simple
disposable plastic sterilized device
that you fill it up with cement and you
smack it onto the tibia and it injects
cement into the tibial surface. But for
me like these kind of ideas
you kind of have to have in your brain
before you start doing anything with it
the entire or pretty close to the entire
process. Like cement punch is a medical
instrument but I knew that it&#39;s not an
implant so I didn&#39;t need five FDA
approval for it. Um, and I&#39;m like,
&#34;Okay, I know what it it needs to be
disposable because you&#39;re not cleaning
out cement out of this thing. So, it&#39;s
got to be made out of plastic.&#34; So, I
just went and talked to I just looked up
plastic injection molders here in
Phoenix and went to talk to a guy and I
said, &#34;Hey, this is what I kind of needs
to be shaped like.&#34; He caddeded it up on
CAD. And then I&#39;m like, &#34;Okay, what&#39;s it
going to cost to get this thing made?&#34;
He&#39;s like, &#34;Well, you&#39;re going to need
an injection mold.&#34; I said, &#34;Okay, what
where is that?&#34; Oh, that&#39;s expensive.
You know, you got to uh get it made. And
so, we had that made. it was like
$30,000 but now you can massproduce this
thing you know so you have to have the
whole process in your mind okay um and
then you can&#39;t be deterred by failure
right I mean even tempa you know as you
know Drew I mean that I had that
templating thing it was working great
all that kind of stuff but man so hard
to implement and then you have to pivot
just like I did with the erramama thing
the remote image product was great the
position of it was so difficult to Well,
and you got to be able to like pivot and
leverage the connections that you have
in order to, you know, get it. And the
final thing is you got to be passionate
about it. You have to be passionate
about it. You can&#39;t be stressed out
trying to create this anything creative.
And at the end, you have to be ready
that, hey, if this doesn&#39;t work, you
have to have the mindset that like at
least it was fun trying to do it. That&#39;s
got to be the key. If you&#39;re not having
if it&#39;s more work for you to try to do
that stuff and it&#39;s just not fun then
man why are you doing it? I mean that&#39;s
just that&#39;s for me anything I do I write
either writing books or writing software
or designing software or you know
starting a company whatever I that&#39;s
that&#39;s passion for me and you know I&#39;m
glad I&#39;m glad if it works out and
successful but I&#39;m not never regretful
that like I did take this on
my gosh if you don&#39;t try if you don&#39;t if
you don&#39;t actually make the effort
you&#39;ll never know what it could have
Yeah. I mean, and and even if you do
fail, even if it doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;ve
actually gained some knowledge on why it
failed. And then if you do something the
second time, uh then you have better
chance of success. I mean, that&#39;s why
even these VC companies, they know that.
I mean, that&#39;s why they invest in 10
different companies hoping that one
becomes successful. And you have to kind
of think about it that way, too. But
nobody&#39;s going to be more of an advocate
for it than you, the person who came up
with the idea and just has that
long-term vision. And you got to and
that vision is comes from passion for
the product and the process of
generating that product.
Would you say failure is is just a part
of the process.
Absolutely.
Not every single thing that I&#39;ve ever I
mean I&#39;ve ever come up with if I&#39;m
successful at but I will tell you that I
definitely am glad that I did every
single thing that I did.
Yeah. Because you&#39;ve done some other you
did other software platforms. Medunnel
being one of them.
Yep. uh you have users on that. So
that&#39;s a another solution that still
creates some revenue for you.
Y but uh and you&#39;ve done other ones. So
right I had a had well before Zoom this
is maybe 10 12 years ago I had a app
called voice spot which was on the phone
but allowed you to conference call with
10 15 people voice only uh and anybody
could speak. It&#39;s kind of like Zoom
without the video but I had that 15
years ago.
Yeah. Did that ever
But that never went anywhere because it
was probably too new for that point.
Too early. Yeah. It&#39;s when the iPhone
was fairly new, wasn&#39;t it?
Right. Exactly.
Yeah. So, um,
what&#39;s next for you? What do you I mean,
is it just
I know what&#39;s next for me immediately.
I&#39;m like, I am passionate about getting
Tempeda out there and just getting out
in front of me enough people because
this is weird. It&#39;s weird. It&#39;s like one
of those products that you just know
once anybody use it for the first time,
they&#39;re just they&#39;re just hooked.
They&#39;re like, &#34;Okay, this is exactly
what I&#39;ve been looking for.&#34; So, that&#39;s
just me is the marketing of that and
getting out in front of as many people
even outside of orthopedics because it
doesn&#39;t care.
It understands medicine in general. So,
it doesn&#39;t matter the specialty and all
all physicians got the same problem
right now.
And then after that,
who knows? I think you&#39;re tackling
something that&#39;s really important. Um,
obviously, you know, the EMR has taken
over health care and it&#39;s it&#39;s had a
really negative impact on a lot of
people&#39;s lives. Yep.
So, this is this is a way to sort of,
you know, take back your life in many
respects and um it doesn&#39;t solve every
problem, but it certainly does solve for
a lot of the frustrating things that I
think, you know, a lot of time wasters
and things like that that that
physicians just, you know, really don&#39;t
have an alternative to fix. And so, I&#39;m
Yeah. So, I I I don&#39;t think that they
actually even talk to physicians when
they design these software. I mean, I I
I I&#39;m like, how the heck can you sit
there and make me do 10 button clicks to
do one order or one prescription, you
know? It&#39;s just when before I used to
just tell my MA, &#34;Hey, could you order
some nappers for him?&#34; And she&#39;d call it
into the pharmacy, right? I mean, now I
got to go through 10 button clicks to do
something that that literally I took me
3 seconds before, you know, but who
designs this stuff?
I mean, I don&#39;t know. Uh and and the
problem with the EMRs is that like these
big hospital systems that are either on
Epic or Cerner or something like that,
they can&#39;t switch out. Even if Epic or
Cerner really revamps everything and
makes it great and super user friendly
and all that kind of stuff, the amount
of training it&#39;s going to take to sit
there and train all their staff and
their physicians, it&#39;s too much for them
to spend. So they keep staying on the
same software that was built in like the
late 90s early 2000s and it&#39;s like
obviously the user interface is horrible
and usability is horrible and we&#39;re
stuck with it. So what I&#39;m doing with AI
is trying to layer a a layer of AI on
top of these things such that you know
it is uh it&#39;s going to these EMRs are
going to be become kind of irrelevant
because the AI is going to be the one
that handles them handles all the the
button clicks and the time consuming
stuff. Meanwhile you tell the AI what to
do with it.
I think that&#39;s my vision for that. Yeah.
Yeah. That&#39;s exciting. Well
good good luck to you. Um, y really
appreciate you uh spending some time
with us today.
No problem. I enjoyed being on with you,
Drew. Appreciate the opportunity.
And uh we will put up a a link to to uh
download the app and get you signed up
for uh Tempa.
Yeah, sounds great.
Awesome. And uh if if they want to get a
hold of you to ask you some questions,
uh what&#39;s the best email?
Kure. K I S H O R E attempita teem pi
Awesome. Well, thanks so much for your
time today. Really appreciate you.
Thanks a lot, Drew.
All right, so let&#39;s let&#39;s see how this
works. Why don&#39;t you why don&#39;t you do a
quick demo with me on Temp show our
friends how easy it is to use.
So all I do I&#39;m going to do is add your
name to my patient list and and then hit
And so Drew, how&#39;s it going?
Good. Yeah, things are going great.
Busy. Um, as usual, summer&#39;s hot, but
we&#39;re surviving.
Yeah, I just got back. I just got to get
out of the heat a little bit, so I went
up to Sedona and stuff.
Oh, really nice. How much cooler is
It was in the mid 90s or so, so, you
know, about 20 degrees cooler. Did some
hiking, just kind of hung out and stuff.
but it&#39;s a dry heat.
So, the It is a difference. I will say
that. I was in Chicago this past
weekend. And it was in the 80s, but it
was miserable.
Yeah. Humid.
Muggy. Yeah.
Yeah. So, what brings you in today? Uh,
orthopedics wise?
Oh, man. Uh, left knee is just killing
me. I don&#39;t know what happened.
Okay. How How long&#39;s it been bothering
Uh, it&#39;s about a month now.
About a month.
Did you have an injury or anything that
you remember?
And I was working out and I just I don&#39;t
know. Just out of the blue, it just
started hurting. I didn&#39;t hear anything
pop or anything. It just started to hurt
and it was kind of sharp pain.
Okay. Which where is the pain? Which
part of the knee?
It&#39;s on the inside of my knee.
The medial side. Okay.
Uh, have you noticed any kind of fluid
in the knee or anything like that?
H I mean, I don&#39;t know. It feels a
little bit swollen and tender.
And you never had any problems with this
knee before?
Not for 30 years.
Okay. Have you had any x-rays done of
your knee?
No, I haven&#39;t.
Okay. So, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.
I&#39;m going to order an X-ray today in the
office and we&#39;ll get an X-ray of your
knee and then I&#39;ll be right back in to
see you. Okay.
Sounds good.
All right.
So, I&#39;ll usually pause the recording
there. You&#39;re going to go get your
X-ray, come back, and now I&#39;m going to
come back and see you after that. So,
I&#39;m going to hit record again like you
had your X-ray done. All right, Drew.
So, I looked at the X-rays you just had
done of your knee, and actually
everything looks good. I don&#39;t see any
arthritis or anything like that, and
your joint space is good. So, it&#39;s
pretty much a normal knee X-ray. So, let
me take a look at your knee itself. So,
it looks like you got a little bit of an
eusion, which means like a little bit of
fluid in the knee. Looks like your range
of motion is from 0 to 130°. Is it sore
here on this lateral joint line? Not
Not sore there. How about here on this
medial joint? Is it sore there?
Yeah, it&#39;s real tender.
That&#39;s exactly where sore. Okay.
And um Okay. So, you know, I think the
rest of your ligaments and everything
are stable. So, I&#39;m really worried that
you may have a medial meniscus tear uh
because you&#39;re real sore in that medial
joint line. Your history is pretty
consistent with that. So, really the
next step for us would be to get an MRI
test of your knee. Uh, unlike a regular
X-ray, the MRI will show us the the
ligaments and the soft tissue structures
like the meniscus, which is a kind of
cartilage. So, I&#39;m going to order that
for you today and they will give you a
call to get set up with that and then
I&#39;m going to see you back in the clinic
after your MRI is done to go over that.
Does that sound good?
That sounds great.
Mhm. Any other questions for me?
Is there anything for the pain that you
can do to sort of take the edge off?
Yeah, we can do that. I can send you an
anti-inflammatory prescription
anti-inflammatory. Uh, I can send you a
prescription for naperson. Uh, 500
milligrams. You take one in the morning,
one in the evening as needed, and
that&#39;ll help with that.
Okay, that sounds great.
Okay, I&#39;ll send that prescription for
Um, anything else bothering you?
Uh, my uh my right wrist has kind of
been bugging me for a while. Um,
It&#39;s not terrible, but it&#39;s constantly
bugging me.
Mhm. Is it on the thumb side of the
wrist that&#39;s bugging you? Uh yeah, it is
just just above my thumb.
Yeah. Okay. All right. And um how long
did you say it&#39;s been bothering you?
I mean off and on for months just
doesn&#39;t seem to get better.
Okay. Um let me take a quick look at it
here. Uh this is called a finkelstein
test. Does it hurt when I&#39;m doing this?
Yeah, it does.
Yeah. Okay. And you&#39;re sore right over
the first dorsal compartment. Um well,
this is a condition that we call decor
veins teninoitis. And what it is is an
inflammation of the of the tendons that
go to your thumb. It&#39;s pretty common.
It&#39;s common uh thing that has wrist
pain. Yours seems fairly mild at the
present. And we&#39;re going to start you on
naperson anyway for your knee. So that
may help out with your wrist. But if
that doesn&#39;t help out, most likely I
would recommend a cortisone injection
into those tendons to to alleviate that.
sounds good. Yeah.
All right, we&#39;ll see you back after your
All right, sounds good.
All right,
so now what are you doing?
I just finalized it. So uh let me share
my screen here. All right. So uh this is
the Tempa app uh running in a web
browser. This is just running in Chrome
right here. And we can see here that
your um recording that we just recorded
was 3 minutes 57 seconds and it&#39;s
processing. So the AI right now is
taking the audio file and then
generating a uh note from it. Then what
else is going to happen is the second AI
is going to take the note that&#39;s
generated by the first AI and then do
some further processing on it based off
instructions that I&#39;ve given to that
second AI. And those instructions we
call macros. So if I click the macros
button, we could take a look and see
what those macros are. Anything with a
checkbox means these will automatically
be applied to that first note to
generate uh the final note. So, for
example, one macro is just to I tell the
AI, give me the appropriate ICD10 and
CPT codes for the note. Um, another one
is a physical exam because a lot of
times I don&#39;t really say my physical
exam out loud and it&#39;s not that
complete. But this macro, for example,
says tells the AI modify the physical
exam to be more expanded with and
consistent with the diagnosis in
sentence format. Um, the let&#39;s look at
another another one that&#39;s
pre-processed. This is a good one. We&#39;ll
see what happens with this. These two
are kind of good. Reduce denials. Uh if
you look at the wording of this macro,
again, it&#39;s just in plain English, but
it says modify the note text. So if any
tests or procedures are ordered, the
risk of denials from the insurance
company is eliminated or minimized. So
we ordered an MRI on your knee on that
one. And so we&#39;ll see what the AI does
with that. And the the prescriptions
macro one is good, too. Um let me see
where&#39;s the prescription one. Uh
prescription side effects. If the note
says a new medication was prescribed,
include in the plan the common uh the
common side effects of that medication
uh and include the common side effects.
So it takes you know approximately 3 to
5 minutes for the uh all this processing
to happen. And typically what I do is
after I see the patient I finalize the
patient so the server can start
processing it. But then I go to my EMR
and do all my order entry. So, for
example, in you, I would go in and order
the MRI and order the napcent
prescription. And typically, by the time
I&#39;m done ordering that, this thing is is
done processing. That&#39;s my general
workflow. If you had brought in some
X-rays from the outside for me to look
at, I typically look at those first and
just start the recording then and then
um and then I just say, &#34;Hey, this is
outside films for this patient.&#34; And
just save my my the films, findings, and
stuff. So your yours your file is done
processing. So let&#39;s go take a look at
Here we go. Chief complaints left uh
knee pain but if you look at it says
multiple orthopedic concerns. The
primary complaint left knee pain which
has been bothering for approximate
month. Okay. During a workout that you
know was exactly what you said sharp in
the medial side of the knee. Uh denying
previous problems with this knee for the
past 30 years. In addition to the knee
issue the patient mentions the right
wrist you know on and off blah blah
blah. So, it&#39;s smart enough to know that
even after we did talked about the knee
and everything, what we&#39;re going to do,
oh, now there&#39;s a new problem that I
need to put back into the history. So,
it&#39;s very context aware of what&#39;s going
on. We talked all all that stuff about
me going to Sedona and all that kind of
stuff that was all recorded, but it&#39;s
not in the note because it understands
what the medical part of the note should
be like. So, really operating like a
very smart human that understands the
context of the note. Um and then
physical exam uh small eusion which I
said active range mode 0 to 100 degrees
with uh significant pain noted 30° of
flexions marked tenderness along the
medial joint line with palpation all
liments are stable patell traction
examination for wrist reveals positive
fklestein test which is what we did uh
tenders over first dorsal compartment
there&#39;s the x-rays of the left knee
unremarkable here&#39;s assessment plan just
did two different assessments medial
meniscus tear given the patient clinical
uh uh medial knee pain limited range of
motion positive mcmurray&#39;s test
mechanical an MRI of the knee has been
ordered to evaluate soft tissue
structures including the miniscus and
ligaments okay second decain stenosis
right wrist the patient has been
prescribed naperson be taken in the
morning and once in the evening as
needed for wrist pain and inflammation
here&#39;s the common side effects macro
stomach upset nausea heartburn dizziness
all this kind of stuff um yeah and then
and it&#39;s split off neopusion is as an
under diagnosis which didn&#39;t have to be
but it&#39;s still correct Correct. And it
says we&#39;re going to use an app for this.
So this is the entire note. There&#39;s
nothing I need to change in this note.
Now, now that the notes here in the
editor, I just go to my EMR and just
paste it in and then it&#39;s done. So
literally, I had to do nothing as uh as
far as documentation. I just had it
record our conversation and it&#39;s smart
enough to get the note exactly the way
it&#39;s supposed to be.
Yeah. Yeah. And then it applied all of
those pre-checked macros to the note so
that it adjusts to your preferences
however you like your unique
way to tell your story to the to the
note. Okay.
And then you mentioned earlier that it
was um it&#39;s not a software pack that you
download. It&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s all in the
browser. So there&#39;s no
Right. Yeah. There&#39;s no software to
download. This is
Yep. except on the phone you download
the iOS app for that which is free to
download and then that&#39;s how you record.
You can record on the phone like I did
or you can record on the Apple Watch uh
and then you just upload the recording
and then from that point on it&#39;s just a
web browser. This is just Google Chrome
that I&#39;m using here.
That&#39;s awesome. Yeah. Wow.
Um and it&#39;s impacted your practice in a
pretty profound way. um right in terms
of your productivity, efficiency,
um what what are some of the things that
you&#39;ve noticed how it&#39;s improved your
A couple things. Number one is obviously
I&#39;m not spending the time to dictate the
note or do that note. And it&#39;s funny, a
lot of people um you know, some people
dictate right after they see a patient,
but a lot of people wait till the end of
the day and go home and dictate the
stuff. And by the time you go home, you
got 20 charts or 30 charts to dictate.
you don&#39;t remember the specific details
of each person. So, a lot of those
people end up start taking notes during
their their thing. And I have a friend
of mine who started using Tempa and he&#39;s
like, &#34;You don&#39;t understand. I used to
have 20 charts every day. I I go home,
but I I go home with nothing now and I
can spend more time with my family.&#34; So,
that is definitely a thing. The second
is that because I spending less time, no
time documenting, I I can see about 30%
more patients in the same amount of time
in clinic. So that in definitely
generates a 30% more revenue because
that&#39;s how revenue is generated. So
those have been the two biggest things
and even like the example we did for you
where you have multiple problems like
your knee and your wrist that used to be
such a headache before. I&#39;m like oh my
god how am I going to document this and
this and it&#39;s just a lot lot it&#39;s almost
like having two patient visits with two
problems. With Tempa it just combines it
up doesn&#39;t care and just you know does
the right thing and and and you just say
it&#39;s just very relaxing being in clinic.
I think there&#39;s a big problem with
physician burnout because of this
documentation problem. And I think that
Tempeda is going to go a long way to
alleviating that.
There&#39;s no question that if it it&#39;ll
address that burnout concern which I
think is across the industry, not just
orthopedics, but every specialty. Just
the burden is enormous. Um. Yep.
Well, that&#39;s great. Thanks for sharing
