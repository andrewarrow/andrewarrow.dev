You come from a background of underwater
naval stuff. So for people that don&#39;t
know who you are, why don&#39;t you give me
like a a background into like what your
your military and naval background is?
Sure. So I was an oceanographer in the
Navy. I did that for 32 years. have
three degrees in oceanography, masters,
bachelor&#39;s, PhD, and my specialty was to
be an oceanographer. And what that
involves in the Navy is providing
information and predictions about the
ocean, the atmosphere, space, and even
the the the the seafloor. And all that
information is used by naval forces. Uh
we were chatting about Navy Seals
before. I worked at the Navy Seal
headquarters. Seals use environmental
information like nobody else because
they live and die by it. If they&#39;re in
the water, let&#39;s say they&#39;re a submarine
or seal delivery vehicle, mini sub,
currents, wave heights, temperature, all
those missions are limited by
temperature. Uh, everyone hypes out
after those missions. They&#39;re long
duration missions. There&#39;s the subs
flooded. So, environmental information
for the Navy. I served on aircraft
carriers, hydroraphic ships, amphibious
assault ships, and in the Pentagon
directing all that kind of activity. So,
but you grew up in Southern California,
kind of like just by the ocean. Always
always around this type of Was it San
Diego you were around?
No, I I grew up in LA. Okay.
And I did live in San Diego a lot of my
career, but like you we&#39;d go to the
beach every summer and uh and vacation
there. And so just uh I was a swimmer,
too. So like to body surf, not a good
surfer, but tried and body boarded too.
And I just loved being in the waves. And
that&#39;s when I I knew I want to work on
the sea and study it.
So the first thing you did once you got
into the military was what again?
So I uh I went to the Naval Academy.
Naval Academy. That&#39;s what it was. Okay.
And then you were working with Navy
Seals doing some SEAL training stuff
actually. So backing up. Uh
I I didn&#39;t really go into the Navy
because I thought I wanted to be a naval
officer. I wanted to be an oceanographer
and I wanted to get a PhD in
oceanography. There&#39;s this institution
in Cal La Hoya called Scripps
and as a swimmer I&#39;d go down there every
year as a high schooler and we compete
in their annual rough water swim
and and uh it was very popular one of
the biggest rough water swims in the
country. And I it was across the La Hoya
Cove was Scripps Pier and I thought
what&#39;s that place and I did some
research and I and I realized these
people study the ocean and there&#39;s so
much we don&#39;t know about the ocean. I
thought that&#39;s it. I&#39;m going to do that.
I want to go there and get a degree. And
and and then I realized the Naval
Academy had one scholarship available
every year to go get a master&#39;s degree
at Scripps. And I re did some more
research and thought that&#39;s what I want
to do. I get that that that scholarship
from the academy. And then after that,
I&#39;d figure out what what was next. And
that&#39;s what I did. So after you get this
the scholarship on within oceanography,
how did that lead into all of this other
stuff with like Navy submarines and Navy
Seals and then eventually into this UAP
Yeah. Well, first things first is that
that was my career choice. Mhm.
So it it&#39;s a specialty of the Navy, Navy
oceanography officer and there&#39;s only
about 400 less or so in the Navy and
they do all these things and they they
work with SEALs, they work with
submarine community. They work on a lot
of aviation cable ships to predict
Uh and then they uh also work with
intelligence agencies to map the
seafloor and do other things I can&#39;t
talk about but big part of intelligence
collection under for undersea warfare
this this community the Navy does. and
and so that was my career path is to
jump around and do things in that
specialty. So I served on aircraft
carriers as I mentioned two combat tours
by the way which were exciting and we
could talk about
We were supporting ground forces so been
flying strikes into Iraq and
Afghanistan. So our ship was relatively
safe. I I wasn&#39;t in combat per se even
though I think Saddam Hussein might have
lobbed a few missiles in our way but we
had a we had a good air defense
capability. But ultimately th those were
uh those were pretty uh exciting tours
for sure.
Is it true we&#39;ve only mapped like 5% of
the seafloor? So we have mapped 25% of
the seafloor globally%. Yeah. But that
means 75% is not mapped. That&#39;s that&#39;s a
lot of ocean floor. We don&#39;t even know
what it&#39;s like.
I was looking on Instagram yesterday.
Someone posted an image of the Pacific
Ocean. You can literally look at the
Earth from one angle and see no land.
It&#39;s just all
It&#39;s all ocean. That&#39;s right. Yes.
Literally.
I&#39;ve s I&#39;ve sailed across that a lot of
times and it is a long haul. That&#39;s Yes.
It&#39;s pretty crazy when you think about
it. This is this is a water world.
Oh yeah.
Right. There&#39;s way more water than land.
70% of the ocean&#39;s covered by water. But
the key statistic is so that&#39;s the
seafloor. The volume of the ocean. We&#39;ve
barely explored 10% of it. So 90% of the
volume of the ocean&#39;s never been
explored with a remotely operated
vehicle or uh or or or a diver or even a
drone, ocean drones. So that&#39;s a lot of
the ocean that we know nothing about.
That&#39;s insane. So we&#39;ve studied more of
the moon than we have of our own oceans.
Oh yeah, pretty much. Yeah, we mapped
the surface of the moon and Mars to a
higher resolution than the seafloor,
which is beyond me, you know, and and
that was kind of my campaign as a
oceanographer is is trying to get us
funded. Certainly when I led Noah, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. So they&#39;re they&#39;re the
top ocean agency and I was always trying
to get us to get funding like NASA did.
NASA always still is just they have a
lot of appeal and I&#39;m not going to
criticize NASA but you&#39;d think we&#39;d want
to dedicate as much funding or to to
explore our own world and and understand
and and so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s something
I&#39;ve been it&#39;s kind of a theme in my
Yeah. No, I&#39;m I&#39;ve always used Noah to
check like wind patterns and swell
patterns and stuff to check surf but
like other than that what does kind of
stuff does Noah do? Oh well on ocean
related things they there there&#39;s a
couple really important services they
provide. One is for all seapports and
coastal areas they run an operational
ocean forecast system. So it&#39;s currents
it&#39;s tide levels and temperatures and
and wind of course and that&#39;s that&#39;s
really important for pilots to go in and
out of port. And our seapports
contribute uh uh almost 25% of our GDP
is is material going in and out of
seapports.
And then uh and then that&#39;s then also
tourism and recreation on the coast. Do
you know this? So they&#39;re providing rip
current forecasts and weather too, of
course. And that&#39;s saves lives. It&#39;s
crazy that a 100 people a year die from
rip currents.
That&#39;s crazy.
Is that nuts or what?
That is nuts. I get caught in rip
currents every time I surf.
Yeah. Anywhere. But if you&#39;re on a
board, it&#39;s easy obviously rather than
you&#39;re swimming when you&#39;re when you&#39;re
and so another thing Noah does I really
a fan of is in the ocean. It&#39;s um these
these this program to explore the ocean.
It&#39;s the ocean exploration and research
program. And what they do is they have a
dedicated ship with a deep diving
remotely operated vehicle with cameras
and sonar and uh robotic arms to take
samples. and they they&#39;re all all over
the world every year exploring places we
don&#39;t know anything about. And the same
office funds other explorers with their
ships. So right now, Bob Ballard, the
guy who discovered Titanic, friend of
mine, I&#39;ve been on his ship. He is in
this area of the Pacific called Iron
Bottom Sound off of the Solomon Islands
where in World War II, 1942
specifically, we were fighting major
battles against the Japanese and we were
getting our butts kicked and and so some
of a lot of the US fleet and Australian
ships are down there. And he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s
characterizing all that with the ROV and
it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting stuff for
Iron Bottom sound. Yeah. How deep is it?
I don&#39;t know. Uh, it&#39;s Well, their ROV
is rated to 6,000 meters, so it&#39;s less
than 6,000 meters. Not sure exactly, but
but deeper than a diver go.
Have you ever did you ever um sail on
any nuclear submarines like like um any
of the uh Colombia class or the Ohio
class subs? Uh actually I I I was on an
Ohio class, but it was more of a
training cruise when I was a midshipman.
And then I was on a LA Los Angeles
attack submarine, both nuclear uh as a
training cruise as well. And then
actually I went up to
Oh, the Columbia class or the new ones?
The Ohio ones are the old ones.
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right.
So I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t even know if
they&#39;re done building the Colombia
classes one.
I don&#39;t think they are.
I still I just saw we saw a report a
couple months ago that they were
spending like it was like$2 and half
billion dollars per sub and they were
doing like a few dozen of them. Yeah,
that that&#39;s a big hefty bill. Yes. But
uh I did go up into the Arctic uh for
when I was a a onestar admiral. Often
when you&#39;re at at that level, they&#39;ll
you&#39;ll go all around the Navy uh because
you need to you&#39;re the Navy spokesman
when you become an admiral. And so you
really it&#39;s important to learn about all
that you&#39;re you&#39;re doing to support the
Navy. And I had a team of scientists and
sailors up in the Arctic supporting the
submarine exercise where they built a
camp and some subs punched through the
the ice cap. And and I got to go on one
of those submarines. Really? The USS
Hampton. Yeah, it was really was quite
an experience. This is interesting
because those camps right there, they
have to set them up in one day and I
mean it gets down to 40 below and if
your skin is exposed to 40 below for
just a few seconds, you&#39;re you could you
could um get frostbite. It&#39;s real
dangerous stuff.
Steve, find a photo of one of those
submarines punching through the ice in
the in the Antarctic. When you got on
that submarine,
I actually have a selfie of me. Yeah, I
can get that to you.
Oh, really? Yeah, please do. So, where
when when you get on that submarine,
where do you leave from? And how long
does it take to get to the Arctic?
Well, I had the easy one because I flew
up to this I flew up there to Ukuik.
Used to be called Barrow
and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we saw.
It&#39;s it&#39;s some badass stuff for sure.
And that&#39;s what and it&#39;s important now
because Russia is challenging us
everywhere they can and and and China
too and China&#39;s sending ships up there.
So we we have to it&#39;s important for us
to have a presence and a capability and
that&#39;s what the purpose of the exercise
was is to have the submarine practice.
Actually there was a British sub up
there too and they were doing tactics
and maneuvers against each other testing
out various uh um
uh procedures and their sonar equipment
trying to find each other. Basically,
it&#39;s a it&#39;s the training we do just to
stay ahead.
Yeah. And uh the amount of I what I
learned in the last probably year or two
was that these subs carry some like up
to 50 maybe 40 or 50 nuclear warheads on
them. All of them.
Oh, I forgot the number. But that&#39;s
about a large amount because they&#39;re
they&#39;re they&#39;re all MVED. So, they all
have like four four or six uh nuclear
warheads on each missile. And there&#39;s
like at least at least two dozen of
these rockets that are on each one of
these subs. That&#39;s right. And the
ocean those are the the the ballistic
missile subs, not the attack subs.
They&#39;re different. The subs I was on was
an attack sub.
What&#39;s the difference?
So, attack sub carries torpedoes and
vertical launch. Some I think they have
No, some have uh tomahawk missiles, I
believe. Uh but primarily torpedoes with
a with a a main mission to do undersea
warfare, attack and kill other
submarines
and ships
and ships and ships. Yeah.
And then there&#39;s other submarines that
basically have on the top of them,
they&#39;re just lined with um warhead
missiles with warheads on them and and
they&#39;re they&#39;re they launch them from
underwater and then they go into the
atmosphere and then the MVs come out and
they hit their predetermined uh program
targets. Right.
Yeah. Big Cold War mission and but still
one today too.
Yeah. Annie Json did this book uh last
year. she let out called uh nuclear war.
I uh saw the show
Oh, you watched that? Watch it.
It&#39;s terrifying. Absolutely terrifying.
And she shows there&#39;s a graphic of all
the submarine highways around the world
and they are there&#39;s Russian and Chinese
submarines that are patrolling off off
of our coasts in Florida, California.
Right here. Here it is. So Russian are
the the Russian Navy are the dark black
uh dashes and the Chinese like the light
dots and the undersea cables are the um
the lines. But that&#39;s insane if you look
at all those submarine highways right
off the coast of California, right off
the coast of Florida and North Carolina
and uh
that&#39;s insane. How do they not like run
into each other? There&#39;s so many of
Yes, that&#39;s a Well, well, there&#39;s
I mean the Caribbean is littered with
nuclear subs. Well, it&#39;s uh our
submarines are really good and I&#39;ve seen
video for example of
our subs under adversary submarine and
the periscopes up and they&#39;re they&#39;re
videoing the propellers of the adversary
and the and the I can&#39;t
this was a while ago but I better not
and that but you you could say you could
expect who it was it was in the late 80s
and the uh the submarine didn&#39;t they
they didn&#39;t know we were doing that. So,
we&#39;ve gone there&#39;s a great book out
there I recommend people read if they
are into this topic called Blind Man&#39;s
Bluff and it&#39;s
I have that book sitting on my
nightstand right now. You
should read it. I want to read it.
And the interesting thing about that
book, so it&#39;s basically the whole
cat-and- mouse game of the Cold War
under with with submarines and tapping
into undersea cables using divers that
deploy from submarines.
Yes. Yes.
While they&#39;re deep while the submarines
are underwater. Uh well it&#39;s some during
the terminals at the terminals where the
sun undersea cables
uh make landfall if you will that
there&#39;s areas shallow areas before it.
That&#39;s where the Russians and we were
tapping undersea cables to basically spy
on the communications.
How deep are we talking?
So I I don&#39;t recall the exact depth but
this these are depths divers could do.
So not probably less than 200 feet.
Okay. And uh um but some of the missions
I think were more extreme. Ultimately we
were both doing it to each other and
very but but and I&#39;ll just say this uh
so that book was I think released in the
90s and a lot of that information I
think has been declassified for those
ops in that time. But to say that we
don&#39;t do that today would be I think
If you&#39;re like me and can use some extra
peace of mind then it might be time to
try cornbread hemps CBD gummies.
Sometimes I just don&#39;t want to be
blitzed. And cornbread&#39;s gummies are a
backdoor to relief without the mental
effects. I take cornbread gummies when I
feel stressed or I take their sleep
gummies when I can&#39;t sleep. And all I do
is just wait for the beautiful calmness
to wash over my body. It&#39;s quite a
comforting experience. Cornbread hemp
uses the best part of the hemp plant,
the flour, for the purest potent CBD.
They curate effects that specifically
help with stress and discomfort, and I
find the result to be remarkably
effective. They also have formulas
specifically for sleeplessness, too.
There&#39;s no fillers or junk. It&#39;s just
fullsp spectrum goodness. They&#39;ve made
CBD their specialty. My favorite flavor
is berry, but they have several flavors,
including capsules if you don&#39;t want the
sugar. Their products are third party
tested and USDA organic to ensure safety
and purity. If you&#39;ve ever experienced
stress like I have, then you might want

There was a there was a spot in the Gulf
or I forget where it was exactly. It was
down south from here, maybe a 100 miles,
50 50 to 100 miles offshore, where these
people were free diving these cables,
like giant cables that are underwater in
the Gulf, and there&#39;s all kinds of fish.
Oh, yeah.
And like Goliath grouper and stuff on
them that people like.
Have you ever dived on an oil rig?
I have not, but it looks absolutely
terrifying.
I can get No. No. It&#39;s just It&#39;s like
you said, it&#39;s like those cables.
There&#39;s all these giant pelagic fish,
tuna, permit. It&#39;s really It&#39;s awesome.
I have friends that go up to like the
northern panhandle and they they&#39;ll fish
up there and they&#39;ll catch all kinds of
like tuna and like sailfish and all
kinds of crazy stuff off of those off
those oil rigs. But I don&#39;t think those
guys have the balls to jump in the
Oh, no. It&#39;s It&#39;s not that heavy. It&#39;s
It&#39;s not a hard dive at all really. In
fact, I should have brought my wife on
this podcast cuz she was a Navy diver.
And so, she&#39;s done the really hard
diving, recovering aircraft. And really?
Yes. Yes. This is heavy stuff, heavy
lifting out from the ocean.
And that&#39;s what salvage divers do.
And so, she had a two tours like that.
I had a guy on here a couple years ago
who worked for the Department of
Transportation, and he was the diver
that was in charge of inspecting all the
bridges around Florida.
Wow. Okay. So he had to dive every
single bridge that exists in the state
and inspect all the pilings, the
structural integrity of all integrity of
all of them. I don&#39;t know how often he
had to do each one, but uh he said I
asked him out of all the bridges, what
was the scariest one? And he said it was
the one that was like 2 miles away from
here in John&#39;s Pass in Madira Beach.
very narrow pass,
but it&#39;s so narrow and so deep and
there&#39;s so much crazy like rubble and
structures underneath the deepest part
of it.
He&#39;s like, first of all, there&#39;s like
ungodly amounts of bull sharks. Second
of all, like the water&#39;s moving so fast,
it&#39;s crazy. He&#39;s like, you could easily
like get snagged on some rebar back down
there and be and drown.
That&#39;s scary diving when you have all
these obstructions and a swift moving
current. And what was the visibility?
Poor too. Very low.
So that&#39;s and bull sharks on low
visibility bad combination.
Yes, 100%.
In fact,
not near here on the other side of
Florida, I went with my daughter to go
free dive with sharks and uh and that
particular day there happened to be
about 18 bull sharks. But if if it it&#39;s
out in the Gulf, so it&#39;s super 100 foot
visibility. Yeah.
And they have a bait.
You mean the Atlantic on the other side?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Golf Gulf Stream. Gulf
Gulf Stream. Gotcha. And uh and so when
they put a bait crate down and the
visibility is 100 feet, they&#39;re not
interested in you. They they&#39;re they&#39;re
like dogs on a scent and they&#39;ll stay
away from you. And it&#39;s a pretty awesome
dive to go do that and see sharks up so
close. But yeah, you don&#39;t want to mess
with bull sharks when the visibility is
bad because then they get confused.
But that was a fun day because we uh at
one point a hammerhead came swimming
through and of and he saw all these
bulls around him and he just he just got
out of dodge.
Yeah. It&#39;s gotten so bad. The sharks
have gotten so bad in Florida that you
can go out there and all these all the
spear fishermen have to do is is just
start popping their bands and the sharks
just just appear everywhere. It&#39;s really
Uh where do you surf?
I surf all around uh mainly on the east
coast like between Daytona Beach and
Sebastian and
Oh, okay. Okay.
Um sometimes a little bit down a little
bit farther south like Fort Pierce, but
and then obviously here um in when was
it? It was like September, October of
last year we had the hurricane. So we
got like some really good waves for the
hurricane swells.
But um but yeah, no the um the sharks
have been have been out of control here
lately and I think it has a lot to do
with the spear fisherman.
Yeah. Well, they&#39;ll bait sharks in
they&#39;ll bait bull sharks in just so they
can like shoot big cobia off the top of
them or whatever and it&#39;s like these
people are nuts. These people have like
a water.
No. Exactly.
No. It&#39;s crazy. And then, you know, in
uh New Simra Beach, which is a really
popular beach in right south of Daytona,
there are an it&#39;s the shark attack
capital of the world.
Yeah. But they&#39;re little they&#39;re like
little spinner sharks and blacktip
sharks like yay big.
You&#39;ll have to go to the hospital.
You&#39;ll get a pretty severe like
laceration to your leg or your foot. Oh
Some guy just got his hand bitten like
in half two days ago.
But um you know, they&#39;re not like great
whites or or tiger sharks or anything
like that. So, I was telling Steve, uh,
when I was at Noah, we had a lot of
great scientists doing neat things, and
I found some scientists in La Hoya,
fisheries biologists, and they share
with me some video of them, and for
every year for 20 years, they&#39;ve been
going to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, off
Baja, to document these white sharks
there. And the what they do is they
would photo ID them diving in steel
cages. And and the science was cool
because basically the stripe between the
line between a white shark&#39;s top and
underbelly which is white is kind of
jagged and it&#39;s unique to each
individual. So the pattern uh along that
border is sort of like zebra stripes.
You can identify individuals
and so because everyone&#39;s different.
It&#39;s kind of like someone&#39;s eye for for
fa recognition
and and so they were documenting new
individuals every time they anyways they
were diving great white sharks and I saw
the video and I thought oh my god I got
to do this
and of course I sub you know I submit a
request or I asked the lawyers to review
it and they all wagged their finger at
me and said no no no you going down
there for 5 days to dive white sharks
that&#39;s that&#39;s going to look really bad
those are bad optics for ethics
government ethics really oh yeah so the
way the environment is now. Okay. If I
were to do that, uh, anybody I was I
worked for Trump, so you can be sure
every Democrat in the Senate would would
say I was waste, fraud, and abuse of
government money to go down and
boondoggle to go diving for five days,
which is legitimate. This this is this
is you got
there&#39;s 21 trillion dollars missing from
the Pentagon. What&#39;s a shark dive?
Good point. Okay. I would have been
doing good science. You&#39;re right. But
ultimately, you always got to see well I
had to always see why ya if you will
just make sure I didn&#39;t misstep.
Ultimately after I left my wife being
former Navy diver she said let&#39;s go do
it and we signed up and did it got in
November of 2021 and it was I remember
thinking this. So our plan was to leave
Ensanatada. It takes a whole day to get
out to Guadalupe. Three days in the
water with sharks and then one day back.
And I thought three days doing the same
thing. We&#39;ve we&#39;ve dived all over the
world on different reefs and I thought
that I might get bored after this. And
then of course the the moment we get in
the water with these animals, I I uh it
was just I wanted and didn&#39;t want to
leave. It was just so interesting to see
these giant bus-sized creatures that are
have all the the reputation and drama
associated with them in their native
habitat and uh and just doing what they
do and being so close to touch almost.
And so now I told I&#39;ve told people this
now I know why bungee jumpers and
adrenaline junkies do what they do
because I could not wait to get back in
the water. I didn&#39;t want to leave. I was
I was going to be there all day if I
could. So and I still
white sharks up close and personal.
Yeah. I&#39;m less afraid of white sharks
than I am of bulls and tigers
because I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think
white sharks unless it was a really
hungry hungry white shark that would
want to eat and consume a human. But I
think there&#39;s been plenty of uh evidence
of of tiger sharks just devouring human
Yeah. And it&#39;s interesting thing though
because like any interaction, you really
have to understand the animals behavior
and and the situation and environment.
So for example, uh I like I like that
we&#39;re talking about this. Uh I uh my
wife and I
supposed to talk about UFOs, but we&#39;ll
get there eventually, folks.
We&#39;ll get there.
My wife and I went to Fiji recently, and
this is so interesting. like a lot of
places in the wild, there&#39;s a resident
female tiger shark there.
And the way they&#39;ve built up the the uh
the dive location is they&#39;ve built a
little wall under on the seafloor and
they the divers will they have you all
sit and kneel on the on the on the sand
behind it. Yeah. And then the the the
professional divers, the guides, they
have a big steel uh box with uh tuna and
and fish heads. And they&#39;ll get out
there and they&#39;re all in chain mail and
which is really interesting to see a guy
in full diving steel and uh and then
they&#39;ll start feeding the animal. And
just this sure enough, like clockwork,
like ringing a dinner bell, this big
mama tiger shark would swim along and
come there and and eat her tuna and then
leave. And and so she made a couple&#39;s
passes and we got all these really close
pictures and and of course the tigers
were all good. They got these big steel
prongs making sure that the the the
tiger didn&#39;t get too close to us. But
ultimately, it&#39;s a chance to go witness
a tiger like that where you could almost
touch it, which pretty awesome.
It&#39;s pretty awesome. There&#39;s also a lady
in Hawaii who does this. I think there&#39;s
a Netflix documentary just came out
about her. Her name&#39;s Ocean Ramsey.
I know about her. Yeah, I think that&#39;s
pretty reckless.
It&#39;s pretty reckless. It&#39;s And it paints
a false narrative of what those animals
really are because those all those
sharks that are she&#39;s diving with are a
very accustomed to seeing humans
everywhere and b they&#39;re very wellfed.
Yeah. That&#39;s the only thing that keeps
her alive.
Those those are beasts. Those are
man-eating beasts. like I that I don&#39;t
know I don&#39;t know you know how to
reiterate that strongly enough for for
people that are seeing these things
where she&#39;s like you know she&#39;s
you know kudos to her for like for doing
what she&#39;s doing and being able
to promote yeah everything she&#39;s that
she&#39;s doing good is great
but like
the fact like coming in all kumbaya like
oh she&#39;s today she has this tummy ache
we&#39;re going to Just if she&#39;s coming at
you, just pet her on the nose and she
will turn the other way. Like that&#39;s
that&#39;s not realiz
that that animal or that species.
No. No.
No. She&#39;s not characterizing them
accurately,
They don&#39;t have feelings like that.
No. There was a video that came out
actually, I think it was a year ago,
maybe a year and a half ago, of a dude
literally getting eaten alive by a shark
in Egypt.
Yeah. Yeah, I have. You saw that one?
I have. Yes.
Oh god, that was
You have to respect the ocean.
Terrifying, man.
It is scary. And there was videos of
that shark swimming around that pier
right before it happened. There was guys
like on the dock. I guess what they were
doing was they were they were dumping
sheep carcasses right off shore there.
And this guy, you know,
should not have been seen.
Wrong place, wrong time.
This happened in well, something similar
in Israel. Did you hear about that?
Yeah. There was an area where I guess
the the the residents or the tourists
had been um kind of giving fish to local
sharks in the region. It sort of had
been a thing for years and uh I don&#39;t
know if you know about the place in
Hawaii where they do this with manta
rays and instead it&#39;s just using lights
to attract plankton. Do you know about
Yeah. Off the big island it&#39;s really
neat. They have a they a hotel had a
bunch of lights to light the water up in
and uh every night it would draw
plankton and and that attracted some
some manta rays and now it&#39;s now it&#39;s a
daily event and they bring divers in to
see it. I&#39;ve been there and it&#39;s pretty
it&#39;s pretty amazing. We So but that&#39;s
it&#39;s almost artificial. It&#39;s kind of
like that tiger shark where they they&#39;ve
almost domesticated these animals.
We got to see mantis in the wild in
Palao and that was totally different.
That was going out and trying to find
them and and then if you&#39;re really lucky
and we got lucky, we found them. But
yeah, Israel had something similar and
and a and a guy they basically found
half of him. He had Yeah. And he was
just I think he was a tourist or he was
a local but he just been
at the beach and it was just not a good
day. the time those aren&#39;t good things
to do to start mixing humans and sharks
in that way.
So, Ocean Ramsey is not communicating
the right message in that respect.
Right. Right. How much of a hand have
you had in like regulating fisheries or
if any?
Oh, well, uh, a lot. So, when I was in
charge of Noah, they&#39;re they have under
that agency the National Weather
Service, the National Ocean Service, and
then this, uh, National Marine Fishery
Service. And that&#39;s their job to
basically do the science. And this is
interesting, your fish. So, uh, now now
you probably mostly are governed by the
laws of the state of Florida because you
do it locally, but out in federal water,
so that&#39;s what Noah owns. And they do
the science to estimate any given stocks
abundance and distributions. And and
then with that, they set the catch
limits to make sure the stock&#39;s not
overfished. So, it&#39;s a very good
service. our fisheries were decimated in
the 80s because we had no real effective
rules. And so with with good and
sensible rules, you&#39;re going to keep the
stocks around and for for both the
commercial and recreational fishermen.
So, um that port I was telling you about
right down the street from here in
Madiraa Beach is the number one grouper
capital of the world.
Next time I come, let&#39;s go diving.
Yeah. Yeah, we should. It should the I
don&#39;t know about that.
Oh, good point.
It&#39;s been a while for me. I haven&#39;t I
haven&#39;t gone spear fishing in years, but
um if I if I do it, I want to make sure
that the water&#39;s clear.
Right now, it&#39;s not clear.
Okay. Don&#39;t
In the winter time, it gets nice. In the
winter time here, we should do it. Um
but what I was getting to is uh we I um
a couple years ago, probably like this
is probably 2015, 2014. Um I went I
started interviewing a couple of the
fishermen that were working on the docks
down there. And uh I come to find out
these dudes are like heroin addicts. The
deck hand. The deck hands.
Oh yeah. Okay.
And uh we started like following them
around like seeing how they live, see
their lifestyle, and they were all very
disgruntled about the IFQ system.
Oh, right. Okay.
And um we didn&#39;t even know that. We were
just kind of like following these guys
around, seeing what they were doing.
They were just like complete junky drug
addicts, like crazy people. And uh we
started digging more and more into it
and we started to learn about this whole
crazy underbelly of this fishing world
that is here in my in my backyard that I
never knew existed. And um so we went to
the the fish house where all the boats
come in and they weigh their fish. And I
like learned the whole history of this
and it&#39;s fascinating how like in 2007
before 2007 here
it was uh a free-for-all. So like
basically red snapper you could get a 3
million the aotment was like 3 million
pounds. All the fishermen would go out
catch catch as much as they can come in
weigh the fish and then see where you&#39;re
at. Maybe you run out, maybe you hit
that three million quota limit in like
October, right? So you have to stop
fishing. You can&#39;t catch any more fish
for the rest of year. So in 2007, the
federal government came in and they
created a monopoly with it. And they
basically said boat owners based on your
previous catch history, we are going to
give you x amount of quota every single
year. So some guys got, you know,
upwards of 200,000 a year, some guys got
£100,000 a year, 50,000 a year, whatever
it was. These boat owners got the best
retirement plan known to man.
Right. So, so, so what did they do?
They started selling them,
And now you don&#39;t even have to own a
boat. You can just buy and sell this
stuff and play with it like stock
this quota. People will lease it out to
fishermen, to boat owners, and then by
the time that deckhand gets paid,
there&#39;s like not much left for them. And
I interviewed some guys that are like a
part of the um that operate fisheries up
in like the northeast and they were
saying when they were down here talking
to me, they&#39;re like it is not like this
where we&#39;re from. They was like they
were explaining what&#39;s happening here is
like carne ride operators just you know
exploiting these guys that are like
they&#39;re they&#39;re addicted to freaking
heroin. They&#39;re coming back from a
fishing trip, blowing their five grand
they made on drugs and prostitutes and
then going back out in a boat when they
run out of money and sea having because
they have no drugs. So they&#39;re offshore
for 10 12 days and they&#39;re they&#39;re
freaking detoxing offshore while they&#39;re
catching fish. They come back, rinse and
repeat the same cycle.
And the dudes up in the Northeast are
like this is not like this up there.
Like we take care of our people. Like we
we protect our community. We take care
of the ocean and our fish. And it&#39;s like
a lifestyle, something to be proud of.
And it&#39;s like the opposite here.
Yeah. You It&#39;s I&#39;m I&#39;m impressed because
I&#39;ve been following fisheries for a
while and you characterized this really
Um I didn&#39;t have enough time runtime at
Noah, only three and a half years or so
address things like that in our
fisheries. And I don&#39;t even know if I
would have had any success based on the
structure of the the federal government
being Noah fisheries and and what we
could do. But that&#39;s a problem. You&#39;re
right about that. I do respect the way
uh the culture up there in New England.
Yeah. Uh the the fisheries culture is
one that I admire greatly all around the
country. Really? Alaska, too?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Alaska, definitely.
Yeah. Big time, right? Like, how could
that not be? Like, that&#39;s such a cool
thing to do. You know what I mean? Like
to say that you do that. No, I haven&#39;t.
I want to go.
You&#39;ve probably heard that chocolate can
cause breakouts. But what if the right
kind of chocolate could actually improve
the quality of your skin? Clinical
studies show that cocoa flavonol, the
powerful antioxidants in high quality
cocoa, can significantly improve skin
hydration, elasticity, and even reduce
the appearance of wrinkles. In one
study, participants who consumed
flavonol rich cocoa daily for 12 weeks
had visibly smoother skin, and twice the
resistance to UV damage compared to
placebo, meaning fewer fine lines, more
glow, and actual protection from the
inside out. But you&#39;d have to eat so
much chocolate to get those actual
benefits that the sugar and calories
would cancel them out or worse lead to
breakouts. Not to mention the heavy
metals like lead and cadmium found in
many cocoa products. This is why I drink
Morning Bean by Verso. It&#39;s a rich
chocolate blend with all the proven
benefits of cocoa without the junk.
Every batch is third party tested for
heavy metals, so you&#39;re getting pure
high flavonol cocoa you can actually
feel good about. And instead of
caffeine, it uses theobo bromine, a
natural compound in cocoa that delivers
all day energy without overstimulating
your nervous system. Plus, the
ingredients are shown to support muscle
growth and performance, improve
metabolism, and provide micronutrients
from superfoods and electrolytes to
rehydrate and fuel your body. And since
taking Morning Being, I&#39;ve changed my
morning routine into something that
supports my metabolism, energy, and my
skin. If you&#39;re looking to improve your

I we could talk for a while. I have a
good story there. So I being here I was
I was oversaw Noah fisheries and so
there&#39;s these things called fishery
management councils. They&#39;re independent
of the government I as the administrator
would name members of the council and
they but they would have certain
expertise and for every region they
would work with Noah to set the the
catch limits and so you have a sort of
third party helping make sure this
wasn&#39;t the government going in
heavy-handed. And so it&#39;s a good system.
And ultimately though, a guy, we named
someone to go to the the North Pacific
Council. And when I went to Alaska, he
owned a fishing lodge up there off Juno.
And he invited me to go fishing with
him. And I was excited because I knew I
knew that I was I was assured to get,
you know, 100 pound salmon and barn
doorsiz halibit. And I go up there and
it&#39;s this beautiful area of the Lin
Canal, snow cap peaks all around us and
we went for eight hours and I didn&#39;t
catch a thing.
no. I mean, and he was trying he was
trying we were dipping for salmon. We
were we were trollling I mean we were
trolling for salmon, dipping for the
halibet and I actually caught an arrow
tooth flounder which is this this really
um raggedy looking thing with teeth all
over. So imagine a flounder with teeth.
Really bizarre creature.
Yeah. But I I couldn&#39;t even keep it. So
anyways, um because it was too I had to
throw it back because it was it wasn&#39;t
big enough.
Anyways, it was one of the greatest days
on the water ever because humpback
whales were spouting and sounding all
around us. It was it was glorious. So
do you see those um those tridents that
I have laying around here?
I saw that one. Yeah.
You know who Manny Pig is? You ever
heard of Manny Pig?
I know that name. Is he
the shark man? Find a photo of him,
Steve. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen him. He used
to be on Jackass, but he uh
Oh, yes. Okay. He He was the guy got the
long hair who like handles all the Yeah,
There you go. Okay.
He&#39;s a legend around here. He lives in
Miami. But um he made those.
He um did a trip with the Jackass guys
to or the wild the show was called Wild
and they went to Alaska and they were
looking for uh orcas and basically they
found a pod of giant pod of orcas and
he&#39;s like take me to the front of the
pod and then I&#39;ll jump in.
What? and he jumped in the water in
Zero visibility in the water
and then he didn&#39;t see the orcas until
it was like from here to like that TV.
Good god.
Right up to him. Guy&#39;s a maniac.
Uh knowing the way orcas treat white
sharks. I don&#39;t think I would have done
that. But but ultimately that&#39;s cool. I
actually did the same. I didn&#39;t get in
the water, but we saw two pods killer
whales on a separate uh excursion on
that trip. They&#39;re they&#39;re magnificent
animals. Well, there&#39;s actually no
recorded accounts of orcas attacking and
killing humans other than inside of a
fish tank at SeaWorld.
That&#39;s right. Yeah, I know about that.
Crazy, right? There&#39;s tons of footage of
like orcas approaching human beings and
like just like, you know, checking them
out and
minding their own business. They don&#39;t
they don&#39;t mess with people.
Why is that? Yeah,
it&#39;s really You probably heard about the
orcas attacking those sailboats off the
off of Spain.
Yes, I saw the footage of that. I saw
the footage of that. So, I don&#39;t think
What were those boats doing? They were
doing something, right? They were um
I don&#39;t know.
They were [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with the environment
somehow, right? Like they were doing
something sketchy and
they might have been like netting.
I don&#39;t forget what it was where it was
off the coast of Spain.
Yeah. Yeah.
Steve, maybe you can find it. I forget
what was going on.
Is it this guy?
Yeah, that&#39;s I think that&#39;s it, right?
Click on it. See the what? See
two years ago. Read what the description
of it says.
Credible video.
Just click on it.
Oh, these are just random. This is just
like a
I thought they were just day sailors or
tourists. Yeah.
Oh, maybe you&#39;re right.
Yeah, there I would have remembered if
it was something
using sonar annoying them.
Yeah, that&#39;s So, we have a lot to learn
is the answer there.
Well, they&#39;re definitely super
intelligent.
Yeah. Yeah. the the way they just uh the
way they treat white sharks is in terms
of just sometimes they&#39;ll just they&#39;ll
play with them and maybe they&#39;ll just
eat their liver and not
very interesting there just the
dominance there is is impressive
yeah I&#39;ve seen some videos of them
attacking white sharks and and I&#39;ve
heard about how they eat the liver it&#39;s
so strange
yeah they uh I mean if you want to talk
about nonhuman intelligence that is a
prime example of it
well this is great because I have given
talks about this. So people when we get
get into that topic of aliens, non-human
intelligence, you all you need to do is
go scuba dive a coral reef. There are is
such a diversity of non-human
intelligence there and and I don&#39;t know
if you&#39;ve met Avi Lobe. He&#39;s the he&#39;s
great guy and I like the way he thinks.
He says, &#34;Hey, uh here you are. Here we
are. The universe is 14 billion years
old. The earth is 4.6 billion years old.
And why why would if life has evolved
here, so we know it&#39;s a property of the
universe. Why wouldn&#39;t intelligent life
have evolved elsewhere? And and we see
it here. All sorts of non-human
intelligence on a coral reef and
elsewhere in the
I went diving in the Gapagos for one.
And that&#39;s that&#39;s remarkable. So why uh
why not elsewhere? And I think that&#39;s
that&#39;s something that resonates with me,
that argument. It makes a lot of sense.
In fact, he likes to say, why would it
be extraordinary to say there&#39;s
intelligent life elsewhere? It&#39;d be
extraordinary if it weren&#39;t,
right? Yeah. Also, the deeper you get in
our oceans, the more alien
Oh my god,
the things look.
So, I love this because uh this this
ocean exploration program at Noah,
that&#39;s what they do. They go down with a
6,000 meter rated ROV and they&#39;re
constantly exploring and looking for new
species and they&#39;re finding them. We are
finding new species every year and
they&#39;re they&#39;re just bizarre. I mean,
they are abs they are absolutely alien
looking. I mean, I honestly Hollywood
hasn&#39;t dreamed up stuff as weird as what
we see in the sea.
Yeah. How deep do those vents get? Those
those thermal vents. How deep are those?
Well, uh they&#39;re over at least Well,
some are 4,000 mters or more. They&#39;re
different ones, right?
But ultimately that the life on some of
those is very weird because they&#39;re
cheosynthetic and so they&#39;re not like
us. They&#39;re not they&#39;re using uh I I
forgot the different chemicals, but
they&#39;re not necessarily oxy they&#39;re not
oxygen breathing. They they they derive
their energy differently,
and that&#39;s a good sign of how weird it
must be on other planets, too.
Yeah. And also, if if you want to talk
about other planets, I think most of the
of the planets that we&#39;re aware of that
exist in like a Goldilock zone that are
able to inhabit life are water worlds.
So far, you know, I I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve
been able to characterize the exoplanets
that are outside the solar system, but
we do know that the moons of I think
there&#39;s Europa and and Enceladus for
Saturn and Jupiter. I forgot which one&#39;s
Oh, the moon. Yeah,
they&#39;re both ice covered and they have
they have liquid underneath. And so NASA
has actually been funding our ocean
exploration program Noah&#39;s for that
purpose to develop the engineering
methods to basically put a a deep diving
ROV on a probe that can land on the
surface, drill through the ice, and then
go explore the the under under the ice
oceans of those two. Uh yeah,
interesting, huh?
Wow. That is fascinating.
Yeah. And you we&#39;re making so so many
rapid advances in commercial space and
you look how easy it is to get into
space now with with what SpaceX has
provided. Yeah.
That we might we might see that in our
I want to know why we haven&#39;t gone back
to the moon.
That&#39;s interesting. Well, obviously you
could see it&#39;s hard and I think it&#39;s
mostly because the government is uh big
and and slow and we&#39;ve just burdened
ourselves with bureaucracy and I&#39;m
pretty much happy with some of the
things the current president&#39;s doing.
they keep pushing it back every single
Well, but again, I think I think
commercial commercial space industry is
going to it&#39;s going to they&#39;re going to
they&#39;re going to do it.
And in fact, we&#39;ve already had uh we had
I forgot what was the company that just
put a probe on the moon. Um this is this
is going to happen. It&#39;s going to
explode in the next decade of commercial
companies going out there. China&#39;s doing
it, by the way.
So to the moon.
Yeah. Yeah. So hopefully uh we can get
this Aremis program on on step. Uh yeah,
but I it&#39;s it&#39;s frustrating for those of
us who want to see more space
exploration.
Yeah, it definitely it&#39;s definitely
strange. It&#39;s what it&#39;s like the only
the the Apollo program is the only techn
technological program ever developed by
any country or company that has not
grown at all or not grown exponentially
since it was conceived of.
Yeah, that&#39;s
right. Like look at every other thing.
Look at every other technological
advancement in the history of man. Like
whether it be war tech or consumer tech,
it&#39;s all if you compare it to what it
was in the 70s, it&#39;s all like look at
the look at the phone, you know.
So have did you ever have anyone on your
show who said that the whole moon
mission was a fabrication?
Yeah. Cyrell had it. Yeah.
So are you convinced?
Um, I think
if I had a gun to my head, I would say
it was it was faked.
Would you?
I I don&#39;t know. I think I I think it&#39;s
complicated. I think that
it&#39;s possible that also if they did make
it, if they did go, I think they
probably had a backup plan, like a back
like backup footage of it. Or like even
if they did go, maybe they weren&#39;t able
to get the cameras and the film through
the radiation belt, right? It could have
been destroyed by the radiation. So,
it&#39;s like we went, but how do we prove
it? Well, we let&#39;s get this sound stage
and let&#39;s record some stuff and and make
it look like we win.
You know, there&#39;s just so many questions
and like the way like I I I have people
come on here all the time and tell me
completely obscene like crazy outlandish
things that they they come with evidence
for it and it seems compelling and
reasonable. And then I&#39;ll have somebody
come in and then completely show me how
that&#39;s all [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] full, you know, complete
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and and and preposterous and
with counter evidence.
But the moon one is one that I haven&#39;t
seen any plausible counter evidence or
hard evidence to refute what like the
skeptics say.
So like until I can get an Apollo
astronaut on here to like debate him, I
don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still up in the air with
it. I I don&#39;t know.
It&#39;s funny because I lean towards it
but the more I get into this UAP topic
and the government cover up, the more
I&#39;m inclined to believe almost anything
in terms of the government fabricating a
story, right?
The problem because there&#39;s all this
national interest for for doing so. We
wouldn&#39;t want the Russians to make us
think that we weren&#39;t ahead of them,
There there&#39;s a ton of reason to do
that. And the more I watch the
government and having played in it at
the high level I was at Noah,
I see how that spin doctoring occurs
every day,
And and uh and it&#39;s a fine line between
what is promoting American greatness
versus what&#39;s lying lying about what
we&#39;re really doing.
It&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s big
questions, man. I mean, it&#39;s uh for one
thing, there&#39;s so much stigma attached
to questioning the mood landing. You&#39;re
you&#39;re automatically a fool if you if
unamerican
completely. Yeah. And uh the other thing
about it is
that time smack dab in the middle of the
cold war when the American when JFK was
killed when we were doing MK Ultra
experiments with drugs on people to to
do mind control
and Watergate. I mean you name it. We
were doing more the the US government
and intelligence agencies were were
doing more deception and lying to the
American people than ever before in
recorded history. Very good point. And
the moon landing happened right in the
middle of it. So, is that the only thing
that they did that was legit?
I mean, there&#39;s a pretty strong record
of lying to the public right there you
you just brought up.
Yeah. Wow.
So, so yeah. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I
would love to uh And then the other day
I watched this crazy documentary called
uh Room uh 237,
I think it&#39;s called by St. It&#39;s a It&#39;s a
documentary all about the uh um the
hidden Easter eggs inside of The Shining
Cuz Okay, so this is crazy. So
we&#39;re addicts of that movie by the way,
my family.
Oh, really?
So Room 237 is a documentary about The
Shining and Stanley Kubric h uh
allegedly implemented some some hidden
messages in that movie.
Really? So, these people that made this
documentary, I think for sure uh they&#39;re
making connections that don&#39;t exist.
They&#39;re going way too far with it. But
there are maybe 25 to 30% of the things
in that documentary that I think are
totally legit.
For instance, there&#39;s this shot. So,
room 237 basically in that in that
movie, that&#39;s what they call the moon
room. So, all this stuff happens in that
room that doesn&#39;t happen anywhere else.
It&#39;s 23 237 which was in the 70s and uh
the 70s and 80s. We thought it was
exactly 237,000 mi to the moon.
Since then we&#39;ve gotten we&#39;ve developed
better sensing equipment to figure out
it&#39;s like 900 more miles than that. We
were like 1,000 miles off.
Um and then there&#39;s also a thing like
the pres the manager of the hotel looks
just like John F. Kennedy in that movie.
Oh. Um, there&#39;s weird sort of
inconsistencies with the continuity in
that movie where there&#39;s like obvious
things where the carpet pattern changes
from one shot to the other and other
things disappear and like he&#39;s arguing
with his wife about don&#39;t you know about
contracts? Don&#39;t you know about secrecy?
I can&#39;t you like he&#39;s he&#39;s fighting with
his wife about living these two separate
lives. And what they&#39;re speculating is
that Stanley Kubrick&#39;s using this as
like uh he&#39;s using that movie to like
sort of like tell people what really
happened. And there&#39;s also a famous
photo that you can find if you dig hard
enough, Steve. Um I was showing this to
uh Rogan the other day of Stanley Kubri
on the set of 2001 of Space Odyssey
walking between the soundstages in the
Europe and Jolly West is behind him.
Walking behind him.
Jolly West is
Jolly West is the uh the CIA
guy who was a part of MK Ultra.
Oh, right. He was uh he I think he was a
a psychologist, a CIA psychologist. I
could be wrong, but he was doing he was
doing stuff with drugs. He was basically
Oh, yes.
He was he was a part of the whole MK
Ultra thing. Find out what his actual
title was. I don&#39;t want to mess it up,
but he he was there for MK Ultra and he
was there uh he was the guy who
interviewed Jack Ruby.
Oh, right.
Right before he had the psychotic break.
Mhm. So, um, Jolly West is, uh, a a very
scary person who was involved in a lot
of the most like deceptive things that
ever happened. Uh, no, that&#39;s not it,
Um, Jamie found it in five minutes.
Steve, come on.
You can do it. Um, so anyways, we got on
off on a crazy tangent about the moon
landing. Well, and I bring that up
because of what&#39;s happened recently and
we kind of I know we revolting ahead on
UAP and we could talk about why I care,
But ultimately that&#39;s what&#39;s just
recently. You probably read those two
Wall Street Journal I did articles.
I did.
And total fabrication and I I know this
100% certainty. I actually wrote one
op-ed in the Hill about it with Chris
I saw that.
And I have another one in draft and I&#39;m
The Hill rejected it. I&#39;m trying to get
it actually. So explain to people who
who aren&#39;t familiar what what was the
the premise of that Wall Street Journal
article that came out. There&#39;s two of
them, okay? And they both basically are
are trying to debunk that UFOs are real.
that that ultimately the first one
talked about the fact that we were doing
advanced technology developments and to
cover it we were planning false
narratives out there about uh about
their about UFOs about that actually and
and we were tricking our own Air Force
officers into believing it was a real
program and they&#39;d go to jail if they
ever admitted it being UFO retrieval
program when and and they the article
basically said it was just a a hoax, a
and and and that was the first one.
Second one was regarded some of the
materials, crash retrieve materials and
uh and ultimately they mischaracterized
an article by Leslie Keane and Ralph
Blumenthal about that and and both of
them at a high level were trying to
discredit any validity with both the UAP
uh uh programs, the legacy program of
retrieving materials and and and that
was it. Both of them were doing that.
And if you look at the details, they
were all there were so many errors in in
these. It was it was all false
reporting. We tore it apart. Chris Mel
and I the first one. The second one
uh in fact was the same. And I wrote a
letter to the editor and so did Chris
Melon and she disregarded us. She never
answered. Right.
And the key thing about this is, and I
don&#39;t like disparaging individuals,
but it&#39;s I guess a key thing about this
is is the former Arrow director, Sean
Kirkpatrick, was the primary source for
and and he&#39;s he has a history of
of um discrediting whistleblowers.
Uh and and that&#39;s just true. He&#39;s he&#39;s
done that. So have others. And uh and
the thing that was most kind of telling
for me is that after I testified uh to
the House Oversight Committee in
November of 2024 about what I knew and
you could go look at my statement and
and my observations and experience with
the the Roosevelt strike group and the
videos that were subsequently released.
Um that uh and I talked about that. I
also talked about visiting Arrow and how
they were they were discrediting other
whistleblowers during my meeting with
them. They actually, here was the crazy
thing, and this is still out there. They
they said that Nimtt&#39;s tic tac event was
actually a US tech demo. And there&#39;s a
lot of reasons I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a
lot of BS.
Oh, yeah. Because first of all,
I was kind of under the I kind of
thought it was US secret tech, black
black budget stuff.
There&#39;s a lot of people saying this, but
here&#39;s my point. First of all, D I know
the four witnesses. I&#39;ve talked to I&#39;ve
talked to two of them, Dave Fraver and
Alex Dietrich, and this this is beyond
the acceleration was beyond anything
they&#39;ve seen, you know. Dave Fraver is
great. I like him. Navy pilot. I work
with these guys. He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know
what that was, but I want to fly it.&#34;
You know,
and of course, but ultimately, so he
couldn&#39;t imagine anything that we had
like that
with the instantaneous acceleration that
would have obliterated any material or
person pilot. And the second thing is
this that was 2004. If we had some
capability like that in terms of
transportation or movement uh we would
have used it on the battlefield in Iraq
and Afghanistan to save lives. And if we
didn&#39;t and if that was US tech then
there&#39;s some real irresponsible actors
out there. So I really that&#39;s why I
highly doubt it was.
but that&#39;s what the Arrow Office was
throwing at me and and actually I
visited them uh after Sean Kirkpatrick
left. But but the point being here is
that in the Wall Street Journal articles
that Sean primarily was a primary source
after my testimony, he made a statement
and you could see it on Twitter. I think
he it was published where he he said
this about me. He said, &#34;Uh, well, Mr.
Galedet&#39;s obviously bitter that when he
came to Arrow uh I wouldn&#39;t give him a
job and I I know that that&#39;s because he
was prone to conspiracy theories without
evidence and I I I verify that when I
asked some of his bosses
okay let let me kind of set the record
straight that was his statement public
statement he wrote it I never I never
went there when he was there I went
there months after he left and I didn&#39;t
go there looking for a job I actually
went there on request of the Navy
liaison a friend of mine in the Pentagon
for years. He asked me to visit
and and so there&#39;s that
first and and why would I now if you
recall I was an under secretary in the
department of commerce that&#39;s higher
than the fourstar service chiefs. So for
me to go graveling for a GS14 job at
Arrow is is a little bit absurd.
And then lastly when he says oh I I
check with my he checked with my bosses
to prove that I was prone to conspiracy
theories. So, in the last 15 years, my
bosses have been two twostar admirals,
four fourstar admirals, and the commerce
secretary. And I&#39;m in communication with
all of them except for the secretary.
And if Sean went to them, they would
have told me.
So, so he basically those were outright
lies about me.
Here I am. I&#39;m I&#39;m just out to serve
here and try to
So, what what
why did he do that?
Why is he doing this? So that of course
this is what you do when you want to
cover up something. You tell a false
narrative. It&#39;s what we do when we spy
on other countries. We don&#39;t admit that
we&#39;re spying on other countries possibly
with covert ops in their territorial
seas, but we do it all the time. We know
we do. So So that that&#39;s the nature of
of classification and and compartmented
programs is we never acknowledge them
and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll often say they don&#39;t
exist outright. And so that&#39;s just part
of the UAP coverup. And I I I&#39;m
convinced that they&#39;ve decided and they
believe they&#39;re right. I&#39;m so I&#39;m not
going to throw I&#39;m not going to throw
shade on their intentions. I think they
believe it&#39;s a national security
interest to keep UAP information and
materials classifi classified.
Where I think a little differently. I
think yes, let&#39;s keep the tech
classified. But so much is out there
now. And with the Schumer or with the
UAP Disclosure Act, the genie&#39;s out of
the bottle. And the American people,
they just they have a right to know the
nature of reality. And the fact that
we&#39;re not alone. We&#39;re being visited.
It&#39;s scary to admit that as a government
because we can&#39;t control our airspace or
water space, but it&#39;s it&#39;s the nature of
reality now. And more and more people
people like you are helping tell the
story. And and there&#39;s there&#39;s a story
out there the American people should
know. and we just have to be careful
about how we communicate it. And I I
believe what&#39;s in this UAP disclosure
act through a process of control
disclosure uh does that in the right
Yeah. Well, I mean going to that Wall
Street Journal article,
one of the things about it, it is so bad
like the excuses they gave in that
article. For example, like the Malstrom
Air Force Base thing that they were
saying it was an EMP that they were
that was so artificial. It was couldn&#39;t
be done. Yeah.
And Jesse Michaels did a beautiful video
on this. The people I recommend people
check out. He he he pointed out like all
the people behind the scenes working on
this. And like there was a lady who was
a source for this article who was quite
literally he looked up her LinkedIn. She
wked for uh Booze Allen Hamilton in the
department of psychological warfare.
Yeah. Oh yeah.
And she was the source for this article.
So like and there was a lot of other
really shady people that were uh that
were working for this article. One of
the guys who was one of the main sources
uh on this topic for the Wall Street
Journal was super sketchy. I forget his
name. But and then like also saying that
all this UFO stuff with all these people
in history like you know going back to
Bob Lazar all the way up to David Grush
was psych was hazing rituals.
Yeah. So, if these are hazing rituals
and these people are going through all
this psychological trauma, I think
there&#39;s like a big class action lawsuit
like that&#39;s coming down the pike.
I don&#39;t think they thought this through
because there&#39;s all these legal issues
with it. If it were true and it&#39;s it&#39;s
so obviously it&#39;s so obviously false.
Yeah, it was very in fact, you&#39;re right.
I thought it was pretty inept and uh and
but also there&#39;s some key people who&#39;ve
been following this issue for some time.
One, for example, is Kirk McConnell, who
had been on uh several Senate
committees. He was a senior staffer for
the intelligence committee and the armed
for services committees in the Senate.
And he&#39;d been involved with this topic
for years in ter at a classified level
and 37 years, by the way. And he hasn&#39;t
heard of this this whole hazing thing
So, it&#39;s just obviously false. And it
was again it was made for the average
American to potentially just basically
cast a little doubt and and stigma on
the issue.
And a lot of average Americans don&#39;t
think this through. And so they see a
Wall Street Journal uh uh publication
and think, okay, there you go. UFOs are
a hoax,
right? Hey guys, if you&#39;re not already
subscribed, please hammer the subscribe
button below and hit the like button on
the video. Back to the show. Yeah. No,
there there&#39;s so I mean to be one of
those officers that are working on those
ICBM bases like Malstrom Air Force Base,
you have to be like the top of the top
as far as like being a mentally sane
stable human being.
Yeah, that that&#39;s absolutely screened
for in fact uh because there&#39;s all these
reasons that for nuclear security you
wouldn&#39;t want someone who&#39;s unstable.
That&#39;s another great point. Jesse&#39;s
fantastic on this. He does his homework.
But um uh so and then there&#39;s the people
who&#39;ve written about it. So I I think
you probably know about Robert Hastings,
of course. Yeah. UFOs and nukes.
That&#39;s right. Great book. I&#39;ve read it.
I I&#39;m basically I stay in touch with him
every week
and we communicated about shared
interests. And here he he&#39;s done it. You
go you read the book
and uh he he did the research and and
the Wall Street Journal did not.
Yeah. that and that has been always one
of my my biggest fascinations because if
these things are cited all around our
nuclear sites on land, what the hell are
they doing with the submarines
underwater that are loaded to the gills
with nukes and are all out all
throughout the oceans?
Yeah. So, like if I&#39;m one of these guys
who spends months on a nuclear submarine
in the ocean,
I&#39;m I&#39;m sure these guys have to have
some incredible stories. Some of them
do, but I&#39;ve never heard one. I&#39;ve never
heard one story.
Well, there&#39;s a reason for that. Uh, so
first off, it&#39;s interesting. Let&#39;s just
look at the data. A lot of these events
have happened around nuclearpowered
aircraft carriers, right? The Roosevelt
Nimtts. Yeah.
So that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of lot lot of
activity there. Um and I have had one
report from an officer who was on a
Boomer some ballistic missile submarine
in the North Atlantic who observed a
contact. I&#39;ve shared this before but
really quickly. It had the
characteristics of basically a Russian
torpedo in terms of closing fast and um
at a high rate of speed and and and
coming at the submarine. And so they and
in an area they wouldn&#39;t have expected
it. So they they did all the crap
procedures to avoid it. They turned
around, they dove deep to nearly crush
depth and when the object got close to
them, it stopped and it it kind of went
around to their stern and followed them
for a while and then rapidly exited the
area. And uh he&#39;s not sure what to make
of that, but there shouldn&#39;t have been
anything there because it was in the
North Atlantic during a a 40 uh 40 foot
seas, right?
And so that&#39;s when there&#39;s high ambient
noise and they never nothing could
detect them. subs. Those subs are quiet
and and when there&#39;s really high ambient
noise, they&#39;re undetectable. So, that
couldn&#39;t have been a Russian
torpedo or high-speed submersible that
that that hadn&#39;t even been built yet.
So, there&#39;s no nothing he could explain
But I&#39;ve not heard a lot of other
reports from submariners because that is
such a classified area because it&#39;s it&#39;s
nuclear security and it&#39;s undersea
security and those are those are the
most highly classified programs in the
government
and I so I&#39;ve not been able to crack
into them. I I I was tangentially read
into some of that
but uh and so I know about that but
nothing regarding UAP but if anything
about UAP in the water is is we that
data resides anywhere it&#39;s in those
programs and they are locked tight.
Yeah. There&#39;s this guy who Jesse also
interviewed Harold Malgrim.
Who said to him the office of naval
intelligence has more data on this stuff
than anybody.
Well right. And he referred to the I
believe the national
more than the air force. Yeah, National
Underwater Reconnaissance Office. I Yes.
So, that&#39;s it. I know about them, but
again, I&#39;ve not been able to see that
information. He&#39;s very uh he&#39;s very
credible. And his his daughter also
served, I think, in the Bush
administration and the Reagan
administration, and her name is Pippa,
and she&#39;s uh she&#39;s terrific, too. He he
he was right on. In fact, that&#39;s
interesting. I&#39;ve been working on this
whole topic of the the nuke detonations
that brought down some UFOs and that&#39;s
that&#39;s what Harold had also talked
Right. Yes.
And there&#39;s a lot of data there too.
So like if you&#39;re So I mean also a weird
thing about being one of those guys on
the submarines is like you can&#39;t really
see it.
All you relying on radar or how does
that work? What other kinds of tools do
they have?
So how accurate can you get with
something? like how much can you find
out about an object that&#39;s around a
submarine but with just the tools that
they have available to them.
It&#39;s difficult and you don&#39;t want to go
active. So active is how you can really
characterize how how large it is and uh
potentially even its shape but that&#39;s
going to reveal your locations. That&#39;s
something generally don&#39;t
going active
using active sonar meaning pinging
sending out a transducer.
So they&#39;re making themselves their
location available to other subs.
Now you can use that. I did my PhD work
on this. You can use an active sonar
signal, bounce it off an object, and it
comes back. And you can use that just
like radar. It&#39;s the same principle with
sound instead of EM energy
to characterize an object, its shape,
it&#39;s if it&#39;s moving, if it&#39;s in its
structure.
And and we have high high frequency
sonars that do this really well. In
fact, that we use them to map the
seafloor and characterize shipwrecks.
Monoa does. It&#39;s great work. But uh
again some marines generally don&#39;t want
to do that because that reveals their
location. So they normally are staying
passive and and it&#39;s very difficult to
characterize an object uh passive
because of you&#39;re only measure or you&#39;re
only hearing the sound they admit which
is either from engineering or flow noise
around the hull of the of the the vessel
or vehicle.
That incident you were just explaining
to me where they thought it was a
Russian torpedo. Did they go active
No. No. Whoa.
So they were just listening and then but
they and they again they dived in.
They dove super deep though and they
thought they were getting
generously. So they they were convinced
they were going to get hit. This is they
they were doing all the things to
prepare for getting hit and having doing
the damage control necessary. Yeah. They
because they never seen anything like
this and they had trained for Russian
torpedo attacks. This was everything
like it. So he he called me up after I
uh uh uh went public on this information
because he said, &#34;I just got to tell you
about this experience.&#34; Wow. So we stay
in touch. There was another one uh I
think I shared about oh also where
someone has called me up and said hey I
I was one of these acoustic intelligence
specialists and we were on one of these
ships that does this they look for enemy
submarines by doing two things they they
first they send out a it&#39;s called a a
it&#39;s a high it&#39;s a high energy active
pulse and then they they listen in low
frequency it&#39;s low frequency active they
call it so high energy low frequency
pulse long range and it&#39;ll always get a
bounce off a submarine and and that&#39;s
how you find them. And then what you do
is you listen passively to characterize
the type of contact. So every type of
adversary platform, whether it be a
Russian submarine or a Chinese
submarine, we know their signature. We
know how and it&#39;s by the by the halt,
the actual hall number. We know we know
they sound like each the screws, the
engineering equipment, the flow noise.
It&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like
your your uh fingerprints uh
acoustically. It&#39;s some that&#39;s again
that&#39;s some of the most classified
information out there. You that because
we we can&#39;t if we reveal that we reveal
our sources, the people who found this
information and that would get them
killed. But this is how we that&#39;s how we
in the field know ah that&#39;s a that&#39;s the
Russian whatever. And so that&#39;s that&#39;s
what we&#39;ve done. The whole core war is
built on that. Some of blind man&#39;s bluff
is about that. Oh,
but ultimately this guy shared with me
that he was out there in Japan in the I
forgot 2000s
and they found twice a really loud hit
when they went active and they switched
on to passive and this is what they do
every time they&#39;ll get a passive hit and
they know okay it was either exercise
they did on one of our subs or they&#39;re
out there listening for Chinese. Ah,
it&#39;s one of theirs and they had nothing.
There&#39;s no passive hit and but but they
had a super loud active hit. What does
that mean?
What does that mean? It means there was
something big in the water moving
because it wasn&#39;t there later and it had
no engineering components making noise.
What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is that?
And then it was gone.
It was in the water column.
So what is Whales don&#39;t do this by the
way. They&#39;re soft. They don&#39;t they don&#39;t
reflect sound pulses at at that kind of
amplitude or that source level. So it&#39;s
a again these are people who had
anomalous observations and experiences
and after I testified they just wanted
to call me and say hey I saw this and in
fact nonunderwater but very cool after
my last testimony probably one of the
neatest encounters or w eyewitness
encounters I had was this uh I went and
gave a talk I I always say yes to
anybody any university who wants me to
talk about this topic because that&#39;s how
we&#39;re going to
that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to turn the tide
uh we&#39;re it&#39;s the next generation who
are not so stigmatized about this. So
any university I go I went up to Yale
they have a UFO society and I give a
talk and this guy comes down he&#39;s he&#39;s
getting his graduate degree and he goes
hey I want to tell you a story okay he
said I was a Navy air crew on S860
Seahawk helicopter flying off the Dwight
D Eisenhower in 2021 and uh he said you
know we a lot of the guys had filmed on
fourlooking infrared uh UAP uh in fact
they had a folder on their secret drive
and they called it range fowlers. And
this is a funny term because it&#39;s it&#39;s
so the term in the Navy for anything not
right like a fouled anchor.
Then you use that for everything. Okay.
Foul the foul the range, right? Like a
fouled anchor. And what what&#39;s fouling
the range? UFOs. So they had this whole
file on all these UFO videos they had
taken. And they kind of used that name
as a sort of joke, but ultimately they
were keeping track of the stuff. And uh
and so everybody knew about it, but it
was no one talked about it in the ready
room. The the skippers said, &#34;Hey, just
we&#39;re not we all know it exists. We&#39;re
just going to live with it.
No one really is asking us to report
it.&#34; And so um but then there was a
point in 2021 where the joint chiefs
based on pressure from Congress directed
everyone to start reporting. So that&#39;s
what they started doing, collecting the
videos, sharing them with the
intelligence officer, with DIA. And he
said one night he was uh getting there
was going to be a drill to do a a man
overboard and that&#39;s where they normally
off a helicopter carrier. You don&#39;t you
don&#39;t launch a boat. You launch a
helicopter. It&#39;s a lot safer and easier.
It&#39;s hard to launch really.
Yeah. You don&#39;t you don&#39;t launch a boat
off a helicopter because the the flight
deck is something like 60 feet off the
water line.
So that&#39;s what that&#39;s the MO. You launch
a helicopter to recover the man
overboard. Okay.
So this was his job. He was a crew chief
and they were he thought there was going
to be an exercise. Well, he got woken up
one night and they didn&#39;t say it was an
exercise. So, he got he thought, &#34;Oh my
god, it&#39;s a real world event.&#34; What had
happened is he&#39;s waiting to get the
plane ready and one of the pilots had
some NVGs and he asked him, &#34;What&#39;s
going on?&#34; He goes, &#34;Put these on. Look
Yeah. Night vision goggles. Look up
there. And he saw flying over the
character. Really just slowly moving
laterally a metallic sphere about the
size of a smart car. just moving slowly
like the Mosul orb like that but at
night and and everyone was tracking it
basically it was in the middle of the
strike group and everybody was basically
saying what the heck is that? So they
launched the Hilo to get video of it and
he&#39;s his crew chief has taken video of
this thing and it&#39;s just moving slowly.
There&#39;s no signs of propulsion or or or
flight control surfaces just a sphere
and then after a time it did what all
these UFOs do. It just accelerated
instantaneously and went to over the
And he said not only did that happen a
lot, he said that the guys and these
other squadron that embarked on the
Gerald Ford, the other carrier that
deployed after them
happened all the time, too. So the the
Navy is sitting on a trove of UFO data
videos just as you said. O and I is I
mean the these are all sources coming to
me saying it&#39;s all there and it&#39;s all
There was also a video that I saw I
don&#39;t remember off what boat what ship
it was but there was a video of like
this orb hovering above the waves and
you could hear people talking about it
in the background. They&#39;re like this
splash like oh it splashed down it
splashed down or whatever it like
disappeared.
So let me tell you about that. This is
great because the
the petty officer on bridge on the
bridge of that ship the USS Omaha
Omaha. Okay.
Uh he&#39;s come out actually. Oh, really?
Yeah. His name is Senior Chief Petty
Officer Alex Wiggins
and he came to me. So, uh after my at
one point I think maybe this Sean Ryan
show I was on or something and he uh he
basically wanted to make that report to
me. He was on the bridge then and and
what&#39;s interesting is I know how it is
on a bridge and that the procedure is uh
that&#39;s like a code word. It wasn&#39;t just
they weren&#39;t saying hey it&#39;s splashing
the water. If an object go is is seen to
enter the water, typically it&#39;s because
it crashed an an aircraft or or possibly
a decoy or something. That&#39;s sort of a
code that is a code word used in the
Navy that something has encounter the
water. And so that that&#39;s why they said
splash like that is that is a a term
that the log keeper put in the log,
right? So it&#39;s it&#39;s official. It&#39;s not
just oh it&#39;s splash. It&#39;s actually an
official term, right?
And so when that happened and that&#39;s why
it was so weird because it wasn&#39;t a
helicopter. It was hovering but you
didn&#39;t see blades. you. It was spherical
and it went into the water. What&#39;s up
with that? And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s it.
That&#39;s right there.
Give us some give us some volume.
Oh yeah, they&#39;re they&#39;re on the Omaha.
These are people. These are my people. I
stood many hours of Bridgew Watch.
Oh, look. He&#39;s filming the screen.
Whoever made this video, they&#39;re filming
another monitor.
Yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s right.
Did they get in trouble for that?
Omaha kid.
So far, not that I know of.
Hilo ASAP.
Yeah, they want to go interrogate the
Keep going, bro.
We could probably bring
Is this boat moving right now?
Yes, she was underway. Okay,
it&#39;s getting close.
Yeah, we have a 31 knots sustained wind
top side gust of
31 knotsy windy splashed
mark bearing in range.
Yeah, they&#39;re following their they&#39;re
following their standard procedures.
Good job, guys.
That&#39;s why.
So, I I have uh been on the bridges of
several ships, hours of hundreds,
thousands of hours of bridge wash. So,
those are folks I supervised. And that
that petty officer who was on the watch
there, he he called me, talked to me
about that experience. He said, &#34;We were
seeing them all the time.&#34; He said,
He said, &#34;Sir,
this is so frequent off SoCal, we&#39;re
desensitized to it.&#34;
Yes. Seriously. And then then and so the
you might have seen Jeremy Corbell had
released video from the USS Jackson,
same petty officer who gave it to him
because he came to me and and he
actually shared me on Signal that video.
And I I said and Jeremy of course said,
&#34;I I&#39;d love to talk to him.&#34; And I I
asked him, &#34;Are you okay with that?&#34; And
he said, &#34;Sure.&#34; So he shared
Is this guy still active? Is this guy
He&#39;s still active duty. Yeah. I I&#39;m a
little surprised, but uh that that he
he hasn&#39;t been outed. They don&#39;t know
that he&#39;s the one that&#39;s that&#39;s
Well, he did it as a private citizen. I
don&#39;t He I know he talked to the Navy
Which which are probably a lot looser
than the Air Force lawyers. So, uh
either way, he got it cleared and I I
know I think that&#39;s really significant.
I need to have a talk with him about
that. Uh but uh but a terrific guy and
he&#39;s one of many sailors right now,
former or still active duty, that are
seeing these things and and yeah, and
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to do.
What do these guys think they are? Do
you talk to them about it? Like what do
you think about it? What do you guys
talk about on the flight deck? Like what
is the
It&#39;s like everybody uh in um in the
public. It&#39;s a range of ideas and some
people are really care but that that one
crew chief who came to me after he he
left the Navy he was he said this really
affected him because uh normally he&#39;d
heard talk of it but he never seen it
and when he saw it he realized like I
did when I saw the video of the go fast
when it was still classified. I
immediately knew that&#39;s not ours that&#39;s
not our adversary tech because I know
adversary tech I&#39;ve been read into all
that stuff and uh I I I we&#39;re not alone.
There&#39;s something I don&#39;t know what
they&#39;re doing. Don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t know
their intent, especially with nukes.
That&#39;s pretty scary. But we&#39;re being
monitored.
I&#39;m skeptical of the go fast in the
gimbal videos.
Oh, no. No, I&#39;m not at all.
No. I mean, I saw the go fast. I I mean,
that&#39;s by the way, if if you look at the
go fast Yeah. Yeah. It wasn&#39;t going that
fast. Okay. It was just It&#39;s just a
relative. But the point of And
for the reason is the plane is flying
really fast in one direction. Yeah. And
there&#39;s something flying the opposite
direction. And with the parallax of the
ocean behind it, it&#39;s totally plausible.
It looked like it was going 1,000 miles
per hour.
Yeah. But it it&#39;s it it was So it was
nicknamed the go fast. That wasn&#39;t what
was anomalous about it. So Ryan Graves,
have you had him on your show?
I have.
He&#39;s great.
I&#39;ve talked to him a few times.
He was out there. They were seeing these
things all the time. And in that one
instance, it wasn&#39;t just one. It was in
a formation.
So what how do you explain that?
I&#39;ve talked about some things. I&#39;ll I
I&#39;ll talk to you about it after we do
the show of some other reasons why I&#39;m
really skeptical about those videos.
Really? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Well, I I I&#39;m I don&#39;t really I&#39;m in and
like the tic tac. Well, here I got
something to share with you. So,
everyone wants to kind of dive into any
given video, but what you really need to
think about is the whole collective body
of evidence. Mhm.
Uh I I&#39;m reading a book now by Jacques
uh who you should have on your show.
I&#39;d love to.
Uh he&#39;s terrific and
can&#39;t get a hold of him.
Oh, okay.
He&#39;s a he&#39;s a he&#39;s in high demand. I&#39;m
not I&#39;m not pushing it.
Well, I uh I just had a great exchange
with him recently. Really? Yeah. I&#39;m on
a group with him and um uh I&#39;ll ask him
if he&#39;s going to be in this area ever.
And so ultimately, he wrote this book,
The Invisible College. Mhm.
Uh I it was it 69 or or something or 75?
I forgot which. I&#39;m losing track cuz his
body of work is so huge and and he&#39;s he
just compiles thousands of these
eyewitness accounts and they&#39;re so
bizarre and so I you know okay I don&#39;t
know first there&#39;s two things the goast
and gimbal they look pretty odd. These
are pilots seeing these things talking
about them. They are in that airspace
every day training. if it looks unusual
to them now then
they&#39;re probably right in terms of being
can&#39;t characterize it don&#39;t know what it
is those things are out there in the
airspace all the time
now people say oh that was a US tech
demo just like the tic tac now in my so
in my experience here what happened for
me is I was I was under fleet forces
command the fourstar admiral norfolk and
I supervised all the weather guessers
and oceanographers in the navy and they
were on the ship weather forecasting the
the Roosevelt belt. So, I had I had some
authority and responsibility for what
was going on there. And um and I get
this email from the ops officer at Fleet
Forces Commander. He&#39;s overseeing the
training exercise that Roosevelt was in.
And he sends it to every subordinate
commander uh me, the the strike group
commander at the time, other strike
group commanders, other commands like
the Navy Safety Center who reported to
him. And and the title of it was all
caps urgent safety of flight issue. And
attached was the go fast video. And this
is over the Navy Secret Network in 195
or 2015 before it was leaked or
declassified.
And and he said basically, if any of you
know what these are, tell me ASAP. Uh
we&#39;re having numerous near midair
collisions. Remember Ryan talked about a
section of aircraft being split, which
is absolutely crazy from a state safety
standpoint. Aircraft, you don&#39;t want
aircraft to be within a mile of you if
and and uh and so he said, &#34;Tell me
ASAP.&#34; inferring and he said we might
have to shut down the exercise if this
still happens. Does this keep occurring?
The implication was if this is some
crazy US tech demo and I don&#39;t know
about it the two star in charge of the
exercise or the two star supporting the
four star in charge of the exercise. He
said I need to know now because there&#39;s
when aircraft carriers train deploy like
this it&#39;s very compressed. Every pilot
has to get certified to land on a flight
deck. Every ship has to check a box
about what they&#39;re doing. Can they do
underway refueling? Can they perform
these weapons launches and and etc. So
there&#39;s all these evolutions you have to
be able to prove you can do before you
go deploy. So there&#39;s no time to mess
around. And the fourstar that I work
for, every week he&#39;d hold meetings with
all his subordinates. I was one. And all
all they talked about was the training
cycle, where we were, anything
interfering with it. It was the number
one job of that fourstar. Train forces
to deploy. So when you have something
effing with a training event, that&#39;s big
And what happened is that video and that
email the next day it was wiped from my
computer and and we never and he never
talked about that UFO encounter. So what
was going on there? Well, it was
obviously classified. Was it a
classified US tech demo? I really doubt
it because again, you got the four star
and all these one stars and all the
these these forces, these ships getting
ready to deploy.
We don&#39;t do tech demos in training
ranges. That&#39;s that that&#39;s what we we do
that in instrumented uh test ranges
where we can gather all the data and say
that worked that didn&#39;t. And so I don&#39;t
know the whole the premise of the tic
tac and the go fast being tech demos in
training ranges
that just doesn&#39;t fly with me. I I don&#39;t
know. You know, there is this
possibility that&#39;s been floated out
there maybe they did do that uh that
that they wanted that kind of real world
sort of uh simulation, but um you know,
in all my years in the Navy, we didn&#39;t
just that&#39;s I never saw that happen.
How much collaboration does the Navy
have with private contractors?
A ton really. They build they build our
ships. They they
so so if if Lockheed or one of these
corporations wanted to test some of
their black tech that nobody knows
anything about not even the generals
China Lake. That&#39;s what they do. They
have an instrumented range there. Yeah.
And I&#39;ve been there.
What&#39;s China Lake?
Oh, it&#39;s something I forgot the exact
term of it. It&#39;s it&#39;s something like the
Navy weapons and training. Okay.
Ask Steve to look it up.
Okay. So, it&#39;s like a it&#39;s just like a
testing ground where there&#39;s no nobody.
That&#39;s what those places are for and
that&#39;s where we do it with those
contractors.
It seems like uh from some of the
stories of some of these whistleblowers,
there you go.
There it is.
It&#39;s beautiful part of the country by
the way, the the the high desert. It
just seems like, you know, some of the
whistleblowers we&#39;ve been seeing over
the last couple years um have been
alluding to this this shadowy uh private
navy or private military that has
essentially commandeered reverse
engineered somehow
advanced technology that they&#39;ve been
able to continuously develop and test
without anyone anybody in the US
military or or government for that
matter knowing about or having access to
like when you like for example like the
Michael Herrera stuff or some of these
other people that Jesse Michaels has
talked to with like um crazy psionic
type stuff stuff that you&#39;d only like
hear about in Stranger Things or
something like this.
So I think private contractor possession
and R&amp;amp;D of UAP materials is happening. I
think that was really we all know I
think generally that that&#39;s how the
legacy program was able to continue and
not be held accountable to Congress. Uh
now I don&#39;t know the ins and outs and
this is this is all information I I I
have second or third hand and I&#39;ll just
actually my my primary source is someone
who&#39;s researched this thoroughly and has
connections in the the right way and uh
and I I believe in him and his
authority. I won&#39;t say I believe in him.
trust him and so what he says I I hold
is true and that&#39;s Carl Nell
who&#39;s Oh yeah yeah yeah in fact I think
you ought to have him on the show he&#39;s
he&#39;s he&#39;s brilliant a great guy and he&#39;s
with me a leading advocate on the UAP
disclosure act so he&#39;s he&#39;s touched
these programs closer than me and recall
he was the army&#39;s point of lead for the
UAP task force another guy you might
want to have on after his book comes out
is Jay Stratton so he he led the UAP
task force these questions. They know
better than me. I&#39;m I&#39;m sure. Uh and um
and and they they all say words to the
effect of yes. I don&#39;t know about
Pentagon money going to it. I&#39;m not sure
about that. I I don&#39;t know. But they
they probably have a better better grip
on that.
Yeah. I think it&#39;s probably just a a
mixture of everything. I think it&#39;s uh
some of this stuff is probably stuff we
have no clue what it is. Some of it
could be foreign stuff. Some of it could
be black budget stuff. Have you seen
those uh those Loheed Cormarants?
No. What&#39;s that?
You haven&#39;t seen the Loheed Corrant? Oh,
pause that. Search for uh Jolly West and
look for the Lockheed Cormer.
It&#39;s a It&#39;s this crazy looking It looks
like a Corant flying through the air,
but it&#39;s an undersea sub. It&#39;s like a
drone. There it is.
Wow. Wow.
is it is it operational?
That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t know.
Okay. Well, interestingly, uh here&#39;s fun
Uh so, in my family history,
I uh
my the original immigrant came from
France in the late 1700s
and uh or early 1700s and he
his son or grandson fought in the battle
of Trenton and uh in the revolutionary
war 1776 and then that was Peter Wallace
Galedet became the
Yeah. uh became the I&#39;m going somewhere
with this became the personal secretary
to George Washington when he became
president and then uh his uncle was the
engraver of the first continental dollar
and then also a Galedet Elisha and and
down the lineage there was a guy a
Galedet who founded an aircraft company
that at the time I forgot his first name
Edson Galedet I think yes he had this
Galedet aircraft company and there was a
point maybe 1917 where his aircraft
called the Galedet Bullet was the
fastest aircraft in the world and then
down the road that company was sold and
merged and ultimately became Loheed
No way.
Yeah. So, I have a personal history
Holy cow.
Pretty weird, huh? Yeah.
That&#39;s a pretty wild story, man.
So, you you got some stock or what?
I wish that we lost that inheritance
long time ago. So, no. Galedet&#39;s a
badass name, too. It
uh you know, it&#39;s a small family.
There&#39;s not many of us in the country.
And uh but
it&#39;s like a strong Galedet. It&#39;s like a
really cool like
Well, it&#39;s like any of names like that.
It originally was French.
It had a a T and an E on the end. You
know how it is. When they came over,
they made it easier for people to
pronounce.
Right. Right. And ultimately, yeah,
we&#39;re happy with it. How about that?
Yeah. No, like these Cormont drone like
these underwater drones are fascinating,
you know, and I&#39;m I&#39;m just like curious
to know.
I had the biggest underwater drone fleet
in the Navy.
Yes. Yeah. That over 120 and there&#39;s
What do they look like?
So, there&#39;s this this is kind of my this
is my business right now. I&#39;m a tech
consultant for underwater mostly ocean
technology but space too. Okay.
And uh I&#39;ve advised a whole bunch of
ocean drone companies, surface,
undersea, and there&#39;s a whole range of
types. The types I owned were
oceanographic. So they were long
endurance. They&#39;re called gliders. Uh so
they don&#39;t they have a thing called
buoyancy propulsion where they use an
air bladder to change basically the
buoyancy. So it goes up and down and you
throw some wings on it. There you uh
Whoa, that thing&#39;s spooky.
So that&#39;s that&#39;s an article I wrote.
That&#39;s pretty cool. That is the Manta. A
DARPA developed ocean drone. Yeah,
DARPA developed ocean drone.
That&#39;s right. Yeah.
Oh my god,
that is a badass looking drone. I again
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s operational but I&#39;d
like it to be so.
Yeah. But uh uh and the other piece is
is paper article I wrote on ocean drones
we&#39;re turning into the aliens ourselves.
I know exactly right. That&#39;s the
interesting convergent. We we&#39;re not are
we the origins of all these NHIS and
we&#39;re just seeing our relives. I think
so. I think we are.
I think so. That&#39;s my favorite
hypothesis out of all of them is the
time traveler one. I think that&#39;s the
most compelling one. I know it&#39;s hard. I
know there&#39;s a lot of a lot of people
try to debunk it and there&#39;s a lot of uh
questionable holes in it, but um god
damn, you know, just with like the
history of of human beings and our
evolution and like the way we&#39;re going
is like dropping sperm counts, dropping
testosterone, fertility rate, dropping
off cliff and uh are you familiar with
Michael Masters, his his
extraterrestrial hypothesis? Like if you
look at all the abduction accounts of
taking sperm and eggs from people,
if there was some sort of cataclysm in
the future, they would want to come back
in time to replenish their population in
the future with sperms and eggs of
people in the past.
And godamn that&#39;s interesting.
I I heck yeah. And and I I tell you my
wife and I we both are into this topic
and uh it&#39;s an interesting journey we&#39;ve
been on and I can tell you how it
started but quickly we would have
thought two years ago this is all a
bunch of BS you know abductions and all
this but man now that we&#39;ve met
and we&#39;ve read John Mack&#39;s book by the
way uh which is really heavy and the
communion by Whitley Strieber we&#39;ve met
uh I and then I&#39;ve they&#39;re documenting
all so when Whitley wrote the book he
got all these letters and they&#39;re All
they&#39;re all housed by people who said
they had the same experience and they&#39;re
all housed at this place called the
archive of the impossible at Rice
University.
And uh and the director of that is
Jeffrey Kryball, Dr. Krypal,
who&#39;s another interesting guy you might
want to have on your show.
Great guy. And actually, let&#39;s follow up
after this. All these people I
recommended, I&#39;m I&#39;m personally in touch
with. And if I say you should go on
Danny&#39;s show, they&#39;ll probably go on
your show.
Beautiful.
Yeah. Jeffrey is amazing. I love him.
Yeah. Um, so back to your drones. I want
to see your drones. You&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re
you&#39;re a consultant for tech companies
that are developing these underwater
drones. Are these them?
Look for ocean glider, Steve.
Ocean glider. Okay. What is the purpose
of these drones? What are they what&#39;s
their function?
It&#39;s oceanography. So long long
endurance uh sensing of the ocean.
And it&#39;s really relevant. So I had 120
of these. A big fleet always out. Uh
that that was that&#39;s one right there. Um
Oh, cool. Like torpedoes. Yeah, that&#39;s
what they look like. And see that big
the antenna at the end? What they do is
they do a basically a zigzag up and down
the water column. Uh so change the
buoyancy. You have two wings. So that
allows forward propulsion with the
seawater hydrodnamics
and and once they once they make a down
and up profile the antenna pops on the
surface and sends the signal up by
saccom and and all gets fed into our
ocean models which are used by
uh surface forces doing undersea warfare
or anti-ubmarine warfare. M
so you have to know just like weather
and and its impacts on radar and visual
satellite communication imaging the
ocean has weather
and so you know this you&#39;re a surfer so
currents uh sea states
salenity differences all affect the
speed of sound so there are areas of the
ocean that
see these are all China ones can find
can you find this
find the American one god it&#39;s a
look at naval oceanographic
what&#39;s the name of your company again.
Look at the Naval Oceanographic Office.
Naval Oceanographic Office.
And that&#39;s funny. Uh ultimately there&#39;s
a story there. So when I had that fleet
of ocean drones and and we had brought
the head of the Navy, chief of naval
operations, John Richardson to see them
all. And he he said, &#34;Great, you should
be doing this. We need to do more
autonomy.&#34; Um, a little a short time
after that, the 2015 or so, you might
have heard the news, maybe it was 2016,
when China seized one of our ocean
drones. Do you remember that?
I do remember that.
Yes. And Trump even tweeted about it.
Some I forgot what he tweeted and said,
but but that got the news, right? And
and what happened? It was interesting.
Um the uh I I never got that. That&#39;s
good. There you go. Uh that&#39;s exactly
what we&#39;re talking about. And so, uh, I
never got a call saying by anybody in my
chain of command, &#34;What are you doing?
You know, why&#39;d you put your drone out
there?&#34; They wanted us to be doing that.
So, they actually screwed up. And we use
that to basically uh highlight all their
negative and malign activity in the
Pacific. And so, we got a lot of good
press out of that. And and they they
quickly returned it to us. And what we
get, what we think is that it was a
lower level com commander of a ship who
saw it surface and thought, &#34;Oh, we
should get this. this will be a prize.
You know, the the leadership of the
Communist Party will be so pleased. And
of course, it was an international
incident and made them look really bad.
So they So I I it was
and it was designed that way.
Uh no, I what I&#39;m saying is I think they
screwed up.
I don&#39;t think they made China look bad,
not us.
Right. But we we we intended for them to
Not really. No. So it was just doing its
job. We didn&#39;t throw it out. now
partially because it was in the South
China Sea and that&#39;s an area that we
want to know the ocean really well
because if China Taiwan is going to get
invaded, we&#39;re going to have to put our
submarine forces and special uh
operations forces there to
keep that block keep that that um that
blockade from happening.
Have you heard of that base called um
Diego Garcia?
Yes, of course.
What&#39;s What is that place all about?
Place looks crazy.
Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s a
Pull up a photo of Diego Garcia. It&#39;s
where we It&#39;s a strategic base right in
the middle of the Indian Ocean.
I heard I&#39;ve heard people call it the
Area 51 of the Indian Ocean.
I don&#39;t know anything about that. So,
sure, Tim.
No, no, I&#39;ll be honest with you because
if there was something I couldn&#39;t say,
I&#39;d tell you.
I would. I&#39;d be on uh Yeah, but uh it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s a strategic asset. I think we
based long range bombers there uh at
different times.
And in fact, if I recall Yeah,
I find like a real like a satellite
photo of it. There you go. Look at that.
Crazy. So they pull submarines inside
there. Like it&#39;s like it&#39;s a perfect
little like a circular island that you
can like park ships inside of so they&#39;re
So those are called atoles.
Atto holes. Right. Okay.
And and they&#39;re formed when a let&#39;s say
an island or a kind of volcanic formed
island uh starts to subside geologically
and the fringing reef around that island
continues to build up over time.
Takes millennia. But uh
we did all the nuclear tests at at
holes, right? Like bikini atole. That&#39;s
And they&#39;re perfect because it&#39;s like a
safe haven from the from the um from the
That&#39;s right. These are great bases, of
course. And that&#39;s why the Japanese
seized them all in the Pacific
at the outset of World War II. They they
had a lot of value and then we went and
retook them.
So they&#39;re they&#39;re Yeah, this is a very
valuable asset.
What a crazy place to be stationed, too.
Yeah. I have a good buddy uh he&#39;s in my
book actually because he&#39;s a mentor of
mine. His name was Admiral Tim McGee and
he was stationed there for a while and
uh surfer like you and uh surf surfed a
lot there during that tour
on the atole.
Yeah. Yeah.
I don&#39;t know if you ever been to Guam.
Especially when you got a typhoon out
there. Guam can have some good
Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. I&#39;ve seen it.
Dang, man.
Yeah, the Pacific Islands for sure. And
and great great scuba diving.
Oh, I bet. I bet it&#39;s probably
incredible there. Um,
you mentioned also this dude Victor. Um,
Visco. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What&#39;s
this guy&#39;s story? Are you I heard you&#39;re
like working with him to do some sort of
mapping of some some stuff.
Yeah. Great guy. So, I got to know him
because he and I signed an agreement
when I was at Noah. He had this
expedition going on where he as a
private equity investor, he had
basically bought a ship and and got a
firm called Triton Submersibles to build
a sub that it was full ocean depth rated
and and he decided well here&#39;s a
backstory of Victor. He&#39;s a um a
mountain climber. Started out as a
mountain climber. was also a naval
intelligence officer in the reserves and
he uh just really enjoyed climbing and
he eventually scaled all the seven
highest peaks on the continents and then
uh there&#39;s a thing called the explorers
grand slam where if you do the seven
highest peaks and ski to the north pole
and the south pole that&#39;s what you get.
So Victor did that and that wasn&#39;t
vicious fella.
Yeah. Yeah. Actually you he&#39;s he&#39;s a
very soft spoken guy. He&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s a
total gentleman. and he&#39;s not full of
himself in any way, but he he can do
things. And and then so he said,
&#34;There&#39;s more to do here.&#34; And he
realized that all the deepest trenches
around the world, ocean trenches, had
never been dived in. Only one that was
Challenger Deep in the Pacific, the
deepest one. And a Navy lieutenant named
Don Walsh did it in 1960 with a
Frenchman named Jean Pequard in a
submersible called Triest. And uh and
then James Cameron tried it again in
2012. Ariana&#39;s Trench.
Yes. And the name of that specific deep
part of it is called the Challenger
Deep. And
how deep is it in?
35,000. So that&#39;s
uh 7 miles.
7 miles deep. Is that the deepest part
of the ocean?
Yes. It&#39;s crazy. And uh
that we know of.
Well, I think we have a pretty good bead
on on on we we we have the general uh
understanding of the bethimemetry of the
seafloor around the world. We just don&#39;t
have very precise measurements in in all
of it. Okay.
But we have mapped that area quite a
bit. Okay. And in fact, the coolest
thing is that when we signed our
agreement, we put our scientists on his
ship. And to do a an accurate depth
measurement that deep, you actually have
to um measure it quite a bit and put
down put down sensors to uh um a to
calculate the sound speed profile all
the way up all seven miles because you
need to know how how the sonar refracts
all all the way down to get a true
estimate of its vertical depth. It&#39;s a
tricky combin it&#39;s a tricky calculation
and so we put enough data in there to
make the most precise measurement of
that deep spot ever. Wow.
And and then he went and mapped the
Illusian trench for the first time ever.
Never been mapped. And that&#39;s
where&#39;s the illutian trench?
It&#39;s up it&#39;s up near the illusian
islands in Alaska.
And that that&#39;s US exclusive economic
zone. It&#39;s important information to have
and and that was part of our whole
national plan to map the US EEZ
exclusive economic zone. That that
that&#39;s something I put forward as a
recommendation and the Trump
administration said do it. And so we put
together this whole national plan to do
it. and uh and they&#39;re still it&#39;s still
being followed. So that&#39;s why we have
mapped uh at least 25% of the seafloor
in our EEES. It wasn&#39;t even 20% when we
started. But anyways, Victor helped us
with that. And a great guy. Now what
he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s realized the cheapest
way to map the ocean, all that 75%
that&#39;s not been mapped is to uh um use
autonomous ships and um and make a fleet
of them to do it. And actually he wants
well probably better to have them be
minimally manned with one crew. And so
he&#39;s he&#39;s building this plan to deploy
that and I&#39;m I&#39;m an adviser with him on
this and and we stay in touch in
different topics. We actually have a
special project I can&#39;t talk about to go
somewhere that your podcast has talked
about. I&#39;ll just say that a uh ancient
site underwater.
an ancient site underwater that I&#39;ve
talked about.
with with man-made stuff underwater,
we we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to go map
it and put a ROV on it. Okay.
And try to date it and and confirm its
existence. And I just I&#39;ll leave you at
There was a story that came out. I heard
recently who told me this, that there&#39;s
I don&#39;t know if this was like special
information that shouldn&#39;t talk about
but I heard that Oh, no. There was an
article. There was an article in the
Jerusalem Post actually about uh they&#39;re
they&#39;re making some sort of a movie
about a discovery off the coast of
Spain. They think it could be Atlantis.
I saw that. Was it Spain?
I think it was off the coast of Spain.
Yeah, I read about that and I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s right.
Why not?
Well, uh and and this is if you do if
you read that&#39;s
if you read
uh Plato&#39;s
dialogues uh where all that information
he puts out a lot of information on the
very specific Yeah.
location of it. And so I I don&#39;t think
it was that close to Spain.
No. No. According to what Plato wrote,
um it was most likely
what is that chain of islands called?
What&#39;s the chain of islands called?
That&#39;s off the coast of It&#39;s It&#39;s kind
of off the coast of of Spain. It&#39;s like
in the Atlantic. Uh Azors, the Azors. Um
my buddy Randall Carlson, who talks a
lot about this stuff. He&#39;s he&#39;s been
trying to put together an expedition to
go out to the Azors for a while. Um it&#39;s
a fascinating looking place. That would
be a fun place to scuba dive.
but uh Yeah. Yeah. The the problem with
the Atlantis stuff
is that are you familiar with the chain
of transmission?
With Atlantis?
It&#39;s insane. Steve, I don&#39;t know if you
ever saved this photo, but we we
famously we&#39;ve gone over this many
times. There the train and transmission
with Plato is it starts with
uh it basically
from the time Plato wrote about it he
was told about it from somebody like a
hundred years before that. I think it
was Ply the Younger.
That&#39;s right.
And then Ply the Elder was like a
hundred years before that. And then
apparently the gap between
uh Solon
and the person Solon got it from was
like a thousand years or something like
this. So there&#39;s like it&#39;s like a
thousand years of verbal basically
transmission never written down once
until Plato. And then you know an oral
history going back 1500 years is crazy.
Oh, there we go. Beautiful.
So, okay. Number one, the destruction of
Atlantis 9,000 years before Solon.
Um, so the oral history of of a thousand
years written down by the Egyptians 8,
this is confusing. 8,000 years before
Solon, it was written down. So, there&#39;s
a thousand-year gap between when when
Atlanus was allegedly destroyed from the
Crus and when uh it was first written
about. So um no actual writing of this
from Egypt. Uh the priest the priest
reads records years pass then tells it
by memory to Solon without consulting
any written records. Uh Solon tells uh
tells his relative Dropodeses. Dropodes
tells it to his son Ceas the elder. At
age 90 tells his Cus the younger. And
then the younger tells Socrates 50 years
later. and then Plato writes it down.
So this is like so it&#39;s basically uh
uh like eight like 7,000 years of just
oral transmission of the stories before
he writes about it.
Um you know which is like maybe but uh
it&#39;s really it&#39;s really fascinating and
Plato was known for he was not a
historical writer.
He was a philosophical Yeah. writer and
he wrote about hypothetical war games
and you know things like the the
allegory of the cave and he was he was
he was writing about you know
hypothetical thought experiments things
like this you know
well yes and
not to discredit not to say that there
there absolutely could be some you know
remnants of a lost underwater city or
civilization just the way like the way
that the climate has changed over
millennia you know since before the
younger dries the place to scene and
like the lowering of the sea level, it&#39;s
very very likely that there could be
ancient cities that are under the
100%. And actually, have you ever heard
of the Saluran hypothesis?
I think so.
Steve, check it out. S I L U R I A N. I
believe it&#39;s this idea that the earth is
so old that there would have been enough
time for an advanced civilization to
have existed millions of years ago and
that there&#39;d be no sign of it in the
geological record because of of a
millennia of of all the geologic and
volcanic and cataclysmic processes that
occur here. So if you just do the math
like like A&#39;s done, there could be
intelligent technology civilizations
that have already formed here and become
right? Totally.
And uh why not? So I I don&#39;t I think
ultimately I want to see some data on
Atlantis and and
I have a few leads, but uh I&#39;ll just
leave it at that. But but then there&#39;s
even the idea going farther back. And I
you maybe you&#39;ve had some folks on your
shows that have found for example metals
and objects that were in parts of the
geological strata that that they never
should have been.
You know I forgot the exact examples of
that but there there are a few out
there. Very odd.
Yeah. Uh this says the core idea is the
hypothesis questions if a civilization
capable of industrial activity could
have risen and fallen on Earth before
humans and if so how we might find
evidence of it. That&#39;s the problem is
there&#39;s no toasters in the desert. We
can&#39;t find any ancient toasters, but we
do have the megalithic blocks. We do
have the great pyramids.
So I This is our discussion before.
Yeah. You look at you go if you&#39;ve been
to the Louv or or have you been to
I&#39;ve never been there.
Have you been to the Lou?
I have been to the Lou.
So you&#39;ve seen the the Egyptian uh
carvings, stone carvings, and it&#39;s just
as you said earlier, they didn&#39;t have
the tools to do that,
right? Did did Georgian Johnny on your
show talk about his hypothesis, for
example, of ancient stone structures and
and and Atlantis specifically?
Uh he&#39;s got a lot of crazy hypothesises,
but uh hypothesis, I don&#39;t know how you
say that.
That&#39;s right.
One of his is that the pyramids are like
time travelers going back and like
creating this stuff to like try to
communicate with us. I get lost in some
of this stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. He&#39;s interesting. But I I
did I did like his Atlantis uh I guess
explanation and and he he in this show
yeah remind me what it was. He he
thought that the Atlanteanss had
developed a form of collective
consciousness that and and you when you
start looking at sigh phenomena
uh this and you extend it to uh a
civilization.
uh his his thought was that large stone
structures could be carved and
transported with a collective conscious
mental like sigh psychokinesis
um and mass effect and when you and I&#39;m
just starting to look at this whole
thing u because it&#39;s it&#39;s coming out now
as we talk about NHI and UAP and
like levitation.
Yeah. Okay.
100%. And and the actual carving of the
stones. I mean you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you&#39;ve had
on guests who who have said that they
did not have the tool the Egyptians and
others before did not the what&#39;s this
gocley tech te tech
they didn&#39;t what do they have to do that
they did not have the metals to do that
this is the most fascinating stuff to me
have you seen these
these are this is a 3D print obviously
of a real granite vase that was found
underneath the step pyramid
granite one of the hardest stones known
And there&#39;s multiple. There&#39;s one over
there. That&#39;s another 3D print. I have a
friend of mine who bought a bunch of
these on the antiquities market. And
they were confirmed, created uh 4,000
years ago, between four and 5,000 years
ago when tra uh conventional
Egyptologists say the Egyptians were
carving stuff using flint chisels and
pounding stones. That&#39;s all they had.
That&#39;s right.
And now you have granite, the hardest
stone on the earth. They took these
vases that were made of that are made of
granite and they measured them in a
light scanner at uh a huge aerospace
company. It might have been Rolls-Royce.
Yeah. What was the precision in terms of
It was they were perfectly symmetrical
and the deviation
uh the the biggest deviation was like
less than the width of a human hair.
Yeah. Yeah.
And um
that that looks machined.
Oh, 100%. Especially when you consider
the fact that these handles are built
into it.
Wow. Yeah.
The handles are part of the of the whole
entire piece of granite,
right? And you look inside the actual
vases and you can see little tiny lined
machine marks in etched in the granite
like it was like it was a built on a CNC
Oh wow. But they know like we like
people have at like there&#39;s been people
that are studying this right now who I&#39;m
currently talking to that are are
talking to all the biggest gr granite
manufacturers, people in China who are
contracted to use CNC machines to print
stuff on computers and they say there&#39;s
no way they could do re recreate
something like this
with granite.
With granite.
So how did they do that 5,000 years ago?
That&#39;s right.
If it was 5,000 years ago, it might have
be way older. We don&#39;t I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s any way to carbon date it.
But, you know,
there&#39;s so many questions, man. It just
doesn&#39;t line up. I mean, the just the
idea that this we&#39;re on this linear
timeline and that, you know, we started
as cavemen, you know, 100,000 years ago
and just was a linear progression ever
since then is uh is is I think that&#39;s
debunked big time, especially there&#39;s
just so much evidence contrary to that.
I do. I think we have to reexamine many
of our theories and it&#39;s a and this is a
big reason why I&#39;ve come out on this UAP
topic. It&#39;s just again like AI said it&#39;s
not extraordinary to think that
technology or advanced civilizations
from somewhere are visiting us or have
evolved elsewhere and it&#39;s it&#39;s
extraordinary to think they wouldn&#39;t be
because of the size of the universe. So,
and but but nonetheless, the mainstream
media and mainstream science refuse to
open the door to that possibility.
They&#39;ll entertain it a bit. Uh but they
don&#39;t they won&#39;t there&#39;s only a few
journalists, not a few. There&#39;s not many
journalists. They&#39;re out there that&#39;ll
embrace this topic and uh and they&#39;ll
kind of treat it as something novelty
and then they&#39;ll move on to the more
mundane everyday things that are in the
world. And I think I&#39;ve always
I don&#39;t have an agenda here. I just want
to know the truth.
Right? This is the this is one of the
most frustrating topics to talk about
because it is by design it the whole
topic and the whole narrative combined
with the way the internet works
is the perfect deception cauldron pot of
disinfo and and and accurate info. So
it&#39;s it&#39;s designed so you will never
find the truth. You&#39;re constantly going
to be a dog chasing its tail.
With this stuff.
Well, true. Uh,
and and when you add in the fact that
you also have people like me online
trying to talk about it and you have
people that just do this stuff because
they make money doing it, right? They
they want to sell books. There&#39;s people
doing it, you know, people that aren&#39;t
actually objectively looking at stuff
like Jesse Michaels is. He&#39;s one of the
but he&#39;s doing great work.
But you have other people that are just
like latching on to like specific
narratives and just pushing that because
it gets them more followers. It makes
them more money.
Then you have to add in all the disinfo,
all the intelligence agents, all the
freaking media people that are paid off,
like the Wall Street Journal that are
being told by people, you know, in
intelligence whether or not something&#39;s
right or wrong, like signing off on an
article like before it gets published.
That&#39;s crazy.
Yeah, yeah, that&#39;s right. I think
there&#39;s just a lot of um very
disingenuous and uh um unethical
activities going on in this whole world.
And I in this space and so uh I&#39;m trying
to counter that or avoid it or get
beyond that. It&#39;s it&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s
definitely difficult. But here&#39;s one for
you. So uh as we my wife and I Karen
pursued this topic uh she have you had
any remote viewers on your show? You
have. I saw I saw that. Um, well, it
turns out, uh, my wife is taking a
course and one of the original remote
viewers is Paul Paul Smith and he was in
the army and he did this work, I
believe, for the CIA and he has a book
out. It&#39;s basically the guide to remote
viewing and this has been really
interesting. Okay, so how does it work?
Well, I I don&#39;t know, but but it works
because if you read his book and some of
the work by um Joe McMonagle,
he&#39;s he&#39;s also any of his interviews are
really terrific because he lays it out
there and so my wife&#39;s been taking these
courses and you it&#39;s very deliberate,
methodical how they do that the course
and she&#39;s um
and uh and she&#39;s basically gotten what
they call hits. She&#39;s had the instru
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, we&#39;re talking
what they do is they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have a
scene and they&#39;ll give her coordinates
and they have a clear image. They have a
picture from it and and then then they
teach her a protocol on how to basically
channel or if you for lack of a better
word where where that is what what&#39;s
there and and and they she&#39;s done this
probably seven or eight times and uh on
almost every time she&#39;s gotten it right
and it&#39;s been these complex either
buildings, landscapes and she has
described them. It&#39;s you can&#39;t make it
up. And so it&#39;s been fun to watch
because everybody has the ability. And
when they teach you the protocol about
how to it&#39;s non-local communication and
information transfer, which is nothing
unusual if you
if you accept the fact that quantum
mechanics and physics is real,
That&#39;s non-local uh communication and
information transfer
that our minds have the same ability.
And in fact, there&#39;s a guy named
Alexander Went who wrote a book about
this called social science and the
quantum mind, I believe it&#39;s called. And
he he he he looks into this idea that uh
we are um we&#39;re basically
wave functions like if you study quantum
mechanics and the fact that an obser
observer will collapse the wave function
the observer effect.
That&#39;s right. And and that that&#39;s what
we are really.
Yeah. Have you heard Georgian&#39;s theory
on this?
No. Tell me.
He&#39;s got this theory uh that reconciles
that with the simulation.
Oh, that&#39;s another one. Okay.
Yeah. So, um
there&#39;s this guy named Claude Shannon
who was the one who developed the idea
of transmission transmitting data like
like bits, binary bits. And um that was
after the touring computer in the 40s
after we first developed computers. Um
and then uh there&#39;s this other guy named
Ralph Landau who came up with a theory
that data on a hard drive has mass.
So uh the way he reconciles the way he
he explains that is um using like the
two laws of thermodynamics. One of them
that energy can never be created or
destroyed only transferred and the other
one is entropy always goes up in a
closed system in our universe. um
disorder it it always increases hence
like the heat death of the universe.
So if you if you take those laws that
entropy always goes up and that energy
and energy and mass are interconvertible
and energy is never created or destroyed
only transferred.
If you have a blank hard drive
it&#39;s going to be all ones or all zeros
before you encode data before you store
data on it. Then it becomes high entropy
disorder of chaos a chaotic mess of ones
and zeros on that hard drive. Right? So
what happens if you erase 100 terabytes
off of this hard drive? It goes from
chaot chaos ones and zeros to all zeros
all ones. The entropy goes down which
according to the laws of thermodynamics
it can&#39;t happen. That that has to be
transferred out of the hard drive.
if you do have all the data on the hard
it would be theoretically according to
Landau that and you could and you could
weigh it and if we had tools to weigh
those hard drives, he thinks that all
the hard drives across the face of the
earth right now and all the server
farms, all the data on every single hard
drive would be like a a kilogram right
Oh boy.
But like every year the data storage
goes up 25%. Now, if you add in uh
exponential growth, like reaching the
tech technological singularity, how much
that&#39;s going to grow, it&#39;s going to be,
we don&#39;t know what that&#39;s going to be.
But if you keep it stable at 25% growth
every year, he theorized in like 340
years, we&#39;re going to have the mass of
the moon on the surface of the Earth in
data stored on hard drives, right?
So, and then, so here&#39;s the crazy way.
Here&#39;s where it gets crazy. If you crack
open a hard drive when it has all this
data stored on it, you can&#39;t see
anything. There&#39;s no, you can&#39;t see the
mass, you can&#39;t see the data, right? So,
if the stuff on the hard drive is
actually mass
and if you can weigh it and it actually,
you know, is mass and it&#39;s
electromagnetically indetectable. He
says, what other kind of mass do we know
of that is not detectable
electromagnetically?
Dark matter. M because we looked at the
spins of the galaxies. We looked at like
the center of the galaxy. The spin is
the same as the outer rim of the galaxy
when it should be faster on the inside.
So they&#39;re saying that dark matter has
mass that&#39;s flattening the spin rate of
all these galaxies.
So he&#39;s saying if dark matter is the
same thing as mass on a hard drive,
that means mass,
energy, and information are all
interconvertible, not just mass and
Yeah. So that means dark matter is a
computational cloud
and our consciousness, we&#39;re using
consciousness as a fundamental way to
interact with that. The same way you use
a computer screen to interact with a
hard drive.
So I was just talking to my wife about
and he thinks that reconciles perfectly
with parasychology and stuff like uh
That&#39;s right. And uh in fact I forgot
the researcher Karen told me and I don&#39;t
remember she there&#39;s a paper out there&#39;s
probably many about um
weighing someone&#39;s brain after before
they die and after they die
and it weighs less after they die. And
this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t anything about the
the fluids and whatever. It&#39;s energy and
mass are equivalent. And you have energy
as an conscious entity and that that
trans that somehow that that energy gets
transferred somewhere and you can
measure it in in the mass equivalent.
Yes. And I and I and I we haven&#39;t gotten
into this part yet, but uh I&#39;m 100%
certain that human consciousness
survives physical death. I I don&#39;t have
any doubt in my mind. Yeah. Yeah. And I
know this for a lot of reasons and um
that have all sort of just a big uh
series of events and things I&#39;ve read
and and I I again um there&#39;s so much in
other religions that embrace this. And
so I I it&#39;s this is again like UAP.
People think this is so fantastic in the
mainstream media and mainstream science
where almost every civilization has
embraced it.
And we&#39;re only now coming back to that.
Yeah. Uh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a and this is
all being studied. Bigalow studied it.
And then there&#39;s the University of
Virginia&#39;s division of perceptual
studies, DOPS. I think that&#39;s the right
name of it. They this this is what they
do. They they have scientists that are
dedicated to studying this
this whole phenomena, which is really
fascinating. And again, I I have actual
And I I know this is I know uh we had a
life experience that caused us to look
in come into contact with a number of
mediums and they are all more accur so
accurate that you can&#39;t make it up. You
can&#39;t accidentally arrive at the things
they know.
In fact, I know several of them. They&#39;re
very and they&#39;re not charlatans. They&#39;re
not doing this to make money. This they
have a gift. They could connect to that.
And there&#39;s a weird interplay again with
NHI and I don&#39;t know how that fits but
it&#39;s it&#39;s and in fact Jacques Valle in
the invisible college talks about this
paranormal element of UAP.
I don&#39;t understand it all yet but I I I
know what I&#39;ve seen and uh yes
there&#39;s definitely something there and
the the simulation aspect to it. If you
if you look at the observer effect and
you say that you know when the wave
function collapse only when you&#39;re
collapses and you see things only when
you&#39;re when you&#39;re observing them do
they actually happen. I mean that makes
perfect sense in a video game because
it&#39;s conserving processing power. When
you&#39;re in one room in a video game the
outside of it is not being rendered
until you actually go there, right? And
that also works perfectly with Sheldre&#39;s
morphic resonance. Right? If one problem
is solved in one part of the world, like
if one person breaks a world record in
France, some they&#39;re going to be five
more people breaking that same world
record in the next couple years
somewhere else.
I like what that guy says. In fact, I
because because he explains monarch
butterfly migrations over generations.
Do you know about that?
So, if you look at monarch butterflies,
how they migrate from Mexico to the US,
I&#39;ve seen it firsthand in in New
Orleans, and it&#39;s spectacular. But
ultimately these these animals they they
do they don&#39;t learn it uh from an
experience. They don&#39;t they don&#39;t ride
the bus with their parents one day and
then next after their parents pass
they&#39;ve learned it and they do it. No,
these animals die before they&#39;ve
completed a full cycle of one going one
way and coming back. So they they uh um
and the only way that would explain how
they know
and then there&#39;s there&#39;s also things
like uh whale migrations or whatnot over
the whole half of the planet
that there&#39;s there&#39;s this resonance of
of consciousness somehow and I I know
that&#39;s touchyfey and there&#39;s not you
need we need more data to explain it but
but it&#39;s the first step I think in
explaining phenomena like that.
Yeah. Same with bird migrations, too.
I have a friend who
You have a friend?
I won&#39;t say his name. One friend. He uh
he he was telling me this funny story
yesterday and he&#39;s a he&#39;s a uh like a
very wealthy guy who uh is not really
into like any kind of like woo woo
spiritual stuff at all, right? He&#39;s all
about his business and and and
uh doesn&#39;t want to waste time doing
anything. and he recently did DMT in his
backyard by himself. And he was telling
me, he&#39;s like, &#34;Danny,&#34; he was like, &#34;I
was sitting in my backyard and I tried
this DMT stuff and I noticed this tree
that I never even knew was in my
backyard. I never even thought about
this tree. Never even looked at it once
or ever had one thought about this
tree.&#34; And he&#39;s like, &#34;It started
communicating to me and telling me that
it was in pain.&#34;
What? Really? And he&#39;s like, it was it
was struck by lightning, I guess, like
during that hurricane that happened a
couple months ago.
And this is so weird coming from this
guy. This is the opposite. This is the
opposite guy I would ever expect. And he
was telling me this sober, obviously.
This was like a day later.
And uh he&#39;s like, &#34;Dude, it was so
convincing.&#34; He&#39;s like, &#34;I&#39;m hiring
people to come out and like try to bring
this tree back to life.&#34; Oh my gosh.
And he&#39;s like, &#34;I&#39;m going to go talk to
it again tonight.&#34;
That is a great story. But like
I think of all the stories you just
I think that&#39;s real.
I think it&#39;s totally real. I you have to
think living things. Living things I I I
have consciousness and and you know damn
well other mammals do. If you have a dog
or a cat, they are absolutely conscious.
Okay. This is
Why wouldn&#39;t other living things have
some degree of that?
And I mean I I not I fully can&#39;t grasp
how how that what that is.
Yeah. But and you&#39;ve probably seen the
studies where they&#39;ll put in a like an
arboritum or what or a greenhouse uh a
bunch of plants and they&#39;ll play like
heavy metal and and another one time
they&#39;ll play like classical music and
and they&#39;ll start thriving under the
classical music and they&#39;ll start
wilting under what you know there&#39;s
something there.
Yeah, that&#39;s an interesting story. My
wife&#39;s a big animal and plant lover so
she&#39;s just going to love that story. I
hopefully it won&#39;t get start taking DMT,
but maybe that&#39;ll be good. I don&#39;t know.
Hey, man, there&#39;s worse drugs you can
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right.
Yeah. No, I think um you know,
especially too like animals like cats
and dogs, you know, there&#39;s always like
I think they can they can sense stuff,
you know,
like they can sense stuff that we don&#39;t
know what it is like energy like you
know like you ever go into a house or
whatever and just be like ooh something
like somebody was murdered in that house
before whatever
like when you know you&#39;re being
that too or uh so animals dogs this is
interesting there&#39;s there&#39;s that uh and
then there&#39;s other stuff too may maybe
related so everybody knows dogs
sometimes know when an earthquake&#39;s
going to occur.
You know what that
I&#39;ve heard this.
Oh, I know it to be true. I lived in
Southern California. I&#39;ve been through a
lot of earthquakes. Really? Oh, yeah.
And then I have friends, neighbors. Oh,
yeah. The the dog was freaking out. So,
now there&#39;s a physical explanation for
this. And this this goes to an this
reminds me of the UAP thing because it&#39;s
ignoring mainstream science, ignoring
really uh relevant
research pursuits. Okay. So when uh I
work I&#39;ve been working with this company
and they uh use what they call space
weather which is ultimately ionospheric
variability. The ionosphere has charged
particles. You see evidence of that in
the auroras. Uh and so um and what
happens and they call this space weather
that as I said that when before an
earthquake is two big seismic plates
start building pressure there&#39;s a lot of
there&#39;s a lot of metal in those plates
and what it does is it induces a charge.
And and it is coupled from the lower
atmosphere all the way up to the top of
the atmosphere.
And you can take space weather
measurements of what they call total
electron count. And before an earth a
big earthquake uh like the coobe or the
the um the Japanese earthquake, what was
it called? The uh uh
Tooka. Yeah. No, To&amp;lt;unk&amp;gt;hoku I think it
was to
that uh giant signature in the
ionosphere right before that. In fact,
this company they&#39;re called precursor
SPC. Yes.
They they uh three four earthquakes in
2024 all above 7.0 magnitude. They
predicted between three and four days in
advance by just looking at space weather
signatures. So, uh this is and so I&#39;ve
been trying to get the US Geological
Survey to uh take interest and actually
maybe do earthquake early warning. They
refuse to look at it.
What it&#39;s Yeah, it&#39;s this earthquakes
kill as many people and cause as much
damage as a world war. But they&#39;re the
typical bureaucrats. All they are is
seismologists and that&#39;s the only way
they&#39;ve known how to study earthquakes.
They refuse to look at a an Earth system
approach, which is what meteorologists
have done for several decades. We
started to couple the ocean and the
atmosphere and the land and the ice
caps, and that produces a better
predictive model.
But no, these bureaucrats have just, oh,
no, we&#39;re going to do it this way.
Have you ever heard of this NASA
physicist by the name of Freriedman
Let me get there. Uh, but but
ultimately, that&#39;s what I think dogs are
tapping into this this this uh
electromagnetic potential that
increases. Um, and they they have a they
have a a they&#39;re more sensitive to it.
well, I think they have senses that um,
and and whales migrate and I think they
are using the magnetic lines in the
earth, right?
That&#39;s what is a hypothesis out there.
So, yeah, a lot a lot of living things
are more sensitive to parts of the earth
system than we are by far.
I always think about like what kind of
things are existing around us right now
that we have no idea are there. You
know, like we didn&#39;t if we didn&#39;t have
the sense of smell. If we didn&#39;t,
right? Wi-Fi. Yeah. Perfect example. If
we didn&#39;t have the haven&#39;t evolved the
sense of smell to detect things like
prey or, you know, whether your building
is on fire or whatever it is. Um, we
would never know if somebody, you know,
farted next to you and you were sitting
in somebody&#39;s fart. Right.
So, how many other things are like that
out there that we don&#39;t have the organs
to detect? You know what I mean?
That&#39;s right.
like sharks. They they do that, right?
They have these uh what are they called?
They&#39;re they&#39;re a word there&#39;s a name
for them. Oh, after an Italian
like the like like Lorenzini.
Yeah. I forget what it is.
But they they can detect electrical
pulses in the water when an animals
That&#39;s why they say to punch it in the
face if it gets tries to attack.
All they have all these senses up there.
Screws up its hole.
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right.
Yeah. They have that.
We don&#39;t.
Yeah. And I wonder like what what kind
of freaking senses do other animals have
that we don&#39;t like even dolphins, you
know? John Lily was doing that study on
dolphins uh that was funded by NASA
where he was like uh looking at their
brains. He was trying to figure out how
to communicate with dolphins like
telepathically, I think.
Right. Right.
Yeah. That&#39;s interesting because we know
we&#39;re we&#39;re beginning to understand and
I don&#39;t know if anybody on your show has
talked about these telepathy tapes.
Do you know what that Oh, yeah. And uh
so why wouldn&#39;t other living things have
the same ability to communicate like
that? And in fact, how do they this is
interesting if you look at how how
complex the social behaviors of a
variety of animals are
and and and they don&#39;t talk. I mean they
may make calls but uh like birds but
it&#39;s interesting how animals can can
communicate without
a visible or oral even way. I mean know
whales vocalize but uh is it&#39;s
interesting. I I think there&#39;s there&#39;s
something there too.
Yes. And I I think it
is I think humans possibly had a
stronger connection to whatever that is
like in the past.
That&#39;s what Georgiani says. I I told you
that that collective consciousness
psychokinesis.
Yeah. I I think this is kind of like a
this is kind of
my thing my thing about this is that I
think before we had ubiquitous
technology and the ability to offload
our memory onto devices and you know
we&#39;re just con constantly
existing in this technological
civilization. I think that we probably
had to have had
a stronger antenna to connect to
whatever that is. Whatever telepathy is,
whatever psychokinesis is. I feel like
those abilities were stronger with us
before we developed all this technology
and that sort of ability has atrophied
as technology has risen.
I I think you&#39;re right. I think people
dependent upon that certainly in the
distant past. Uh, and there&#39;s a u study
out there somewhere. I think anybody
who&#39;s a twin knows this. I&#39;ve talked to
twins. They sometimes can uh communicate
with their sibling, their twin sibling,
without talking. And and it&#39;s it&#39;s hard,
but I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve heard this so often.
It&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a one-off,
right? And uh and so there&#39;s something
similar there that that we all maybe
have that innate ability, but it&#39;s yeah,
it&#39;s atrophied and distracted from
technology.
Going back to your earthquake uh what
you were saying about the earthquakes.
Um there&#39;s this guy named Freriedman
Freud. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of
him. He&#39;s a NASA physicist. No.
And he did this talk. He he&#39;s done TED
talks before and he&#39;s also had a
conversation with Christopher Dunn who&#39;s
the guy who wrote the uh Giza power
plant book and his his new book&#39;s called
the Tesla connection.
So what Freeman Freud figured out which
I think is directly connected to what
you were saying is you can detect
earthquakes using uh these things called
earthquake lights. So what he&#39;s saying
what he&#39;s what he&#39;s showing is like
ignous ignous rock deep beneath the
earth deep beneath the earth. Easy for
you to say. When it rubs against each
other, when those rocks grind under the
under the earth, like deep deep in the
earth, it creates it sort of like
creates this electron these these
electrons. Yeah. Same thing.
That light up and create these lights
that shoot up out of the out of the
ground and it people mistake them for
but it&#39;s like if you can find images of
earthquake lights, apparently it always
happens in Marfa, Texas.
Oh, right. So Marfa, Texas is like
synonymous is like famous for having
these earthqualites.
I didn&#39;t know that that was due to
seismic activity. Yes. Oh, it is. Oh,
According to Freriedman Freud and he did
a he did an experiment where um they
they took granite, right? And they they
took it and they grinded it against each
other and they smashed granite together
and they were put putting electrodes on
either end of the granite rods and they
were they were measuring electrons.
Yeah. It was creating electricity.
A current. Electric current. Yes.
That&#39;s the exact same thing. He&#39;s
talking about that location under the
surface. So it&#39;s it&#39;s throughout it&#39;s in
the strata up to the surface up to the
top of the atmosphere.
So yeah, however you want to detect it,
you can detect it. Yeah. I mean talking
we&#39;re talking tons of metals that are
all pressuring.
Look up Freriedman Freud. Um and then so
so Chris Dunn interviewed him for his
book uh the Tesla Giza the Tesla
connection. And what Chris Dunn&#39;s new
hypothesis is is that um the great
pyramid is on the Giza plateau which he
believes is is seismically active or
whatever. Like I guess there&#39;s a lot of
ignous rock that moves around underneath
the pyramids.
And he thinks that it that the Great
Pyramid is a solid state these are just
photos of him, Steve. Um a solid state
electron harvester.
So he thinks that&#39;s interesting.
Yeah. He thinks that all of the stones
and all of the all of the um the
limestone and the granite is harvesting
the electrons from deep underneath the
Channeling them into that pyramid and
using it to conduct electricity. He
thinks it was like a a free energy
That&#39;s a big That&#39;s a big machine.
Have you been there? Oh, yeah.
I&#39;ve never been there. No, I I I can&#39;t
wait to go.
That is a phenomenal experience when you
see something so massive and uh it&#39;s
Yes. Yeah. I I that that that&#39;s see that
is uh makes a lot of sense and the
physics are pretty well proven. In fact,
the um for this the space weather
element of this phenomena the Europeans
the European Space Agency did a a study
they called it inspire and I forgot what
the acronym stands for but it was about
these uh ionospheric precursors that are
observable before earthquakes. So we we
have studies out there and then you got
our government that&#39;s just sitting on
you know what rather than being
innovative just it really again people
just not looking at things with clear
eyes and taking some action on it. M so
back to this underwater stuff.
If you were if if uh
the leader of the free world was to go
to you and say we need to figure out out
a way to ensure the survival of our
species in the case of an thermonuclear
war or a cosmic cataclysm.
Uh and we need to do it underwater or
maybe not. Maybe they don&#39;t even say
that. Would you would you think or
suggest that underwater would be the
best case scenario for something like
It it would be a a top contender. I
mean, underwater or under the land. And
I don&#39;t know it there&#39;s um it could be
either, but we&#39;d have to we couldn&#39;t
live in the surface because of the
radiation. So, we&#39;d have to find a way.
I think the water&#39;s a good buffer for
It would be a much easier underground,
I don&#39;t know about that. Uh, I guess
depending on the Yeah, very deep in the
ocean is hard to get to. But uh,
interestingly, I&#39;m working with a
company called deep that is building
undersea habitats. And so this is this
is not just a theoretical. They&#39;re
building these
mostly for tourism, dive tourism, and
recreation. But uh,
that might this is something that can be
done. We have the engineering behind it.
People have proven it. Funny thing about
the space program, uh, I got to meet
Scott Carpenter who was one of the
Mercury astronauts.
And he happens to be the only one, you
know, that I know of that also was a
aquinaut. So, he lived in sea lab for a
while off La Hoya,
the La Hoya coastline in California, and
set some human undersea endurance
record. But, uh, and I asked him about
that and I said, &#34;What do you how do you
compare space exploration and ocean
exploration?&#34; And he and he told me that
they don&#39;t compare. Space is all
glorious and shiny and it&#39;s very quick.
You open a space mission in just a few
days, but when you&#39;re underwater, it&#39;s
cold and dark and everything breaks. And
I laugh because he he made it sound like
space was a cakewalk and the ocean was
was the real challenge. Yeah. And and
what&#39;s funny about that is that if you
remember Kennedy&#39;s speech at Rice when
he challenged America to go into space,
he talked about we do these things not
because they&#39;re easy, but because
they&#39;re hard. So he was saying space is
hard, but we&#39;re going to do it. And I
got the astronauts to tell me, yeah, but
ocean&#39;s a lot harder. However, I&#39;m
seeing a lot of ocean innovators like
this deep company that&#39;s making it
happen. Victor made it happen in his
submersible. He dived all the five deep
trenches, right?
And uh and that was just extraordinary.
Um Not like the Ocean Gate disaster that
that submersible which collapsed because
they didn&#39;t do the right engineering. In
fact, Victor and I know two of the
people that were on that sub.
Yeah. Yeah. There was a Pierre Narle.
Victor knows him well. I met him. And
then there was um um Oh, Hamish Harding,
Explorer. Went into space with Victor. I
met him at the Explorers Club. And uh
and it was just so disappointing because
we we Victor had warned them that
engineering of that is not it&#39;s not
proven. They never did a test in a tank
like Victor did. There&#39;s only one tank
in the world that can pressure depth the
full ocean depth.
Yeah. It&#39;s in Russia. But Victor did it
because he knew he had to do that to
ensure he was safe to go down.
So it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a big pool that
they can like they can increase the
It&#39;s a tank. It&#39;s a tank. Yeah. It&#39;s all
enclosed. They increase the pressure.
They simulate seven miles down and they
did it and they proved that the pressure
haul of the submersible could withstand
that pressure.
Do they do this with full size like
battle subs?
Well, I I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I
think they
No. Submarines. Yeah. Submersibles that
do that are are smaller. Submarines
don&#39;t go down more than a few hundred
Oh, really?
No. No. They don&#39;t.
How deep what&#39;s the deepest nuclear sub
could go?
Uh, it&#39;s classified, but it&#39;s several
hundred feet.
Several hundred.
Several hundred feet. And uh ultimately
uh though that because that&#39;s all we
really need to operate. Why would you go
deeper when the the targets you care
about are no deeper than you are. There
other subs and ships.
We need to get windows on those subs,
too. So they can see the UFOs flying
That&#39;s right.
The UFOs.
All right. I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to do
something about that.
We need to Yeah. Or get some sort of
technology where you can make the metal
transparent or something. Translucent,
you know.
Yeah. I I I want to I in fact I&#39;ve been
I know the science adviser to the
president Michael Katzios and I&#39;ve asked
him and I&#39;m going to ask him again every
year the office of science and
technology policy in the White House
puts out an annual research and
development priorities memorandum and
I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;ve contributed to it I
always put ocean things on it when I was
at Noah
but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve asked him to start
considering UAP and USO research so that
if he puts it in the memo that means all
the federal agencies that do stuff in
either in the atmosphere or ocean have
to start studying them. So if I were to
get him to do that, that means no would
have to would start researching USOs as
well as OI and my old organization, the
Naval Oceanographic Office.
Do you think that there&#39;s actual like
underwater bases that these crafts are
going to?
So I saw you had Richard Dolan on who is
a friend of mine and I like him a great
He&#39;s incredible.
Yeah, this book is 600 like witness
Oh, I I&#39;ve I&#39;ve uh read through most of
The one from the 1700s, the ship.
Was insane.
I uh saw you talk to him about that. And
yes. Uh so, well, I don&#39;t know. Uh but
we know they they&#39;re in the water a lot
and they come from the water, go into
the water. We just saw the Omaha. Where
do they go? They have to they so that it
if we know that there and by the way, we
don&#39;t know much about the ocean. So, if
we&#39;re seeing them come from the ocean
and go in and we&#39;ve only explored 10% of
the ocean volume and 25% of the
there&#39;s a pretty good bet that more
research into explore the ocean might
teach us a whole lot more about USOS and
And what would where do you think if you
were them would be the best place to
hide your base?
Antarctica.
Well, uh all these places that people
aren&#39;t. Yes, exactly. But the weird
thing is that this big hot spot is off
SoCal. You might know
that is weird. Yeah. Like
it&#39;s highly populated. What&#39;s going on
there? And in fact, I have a friend who
is u I have a friend.
You too?
Yes. Exactly. And he uh his actually his
daughter is going to the Naval Academy
on the swim team with my daughter
and uh so we&#39;re proud of them. And he
was a Naval Academy graduate in my
wife&#39;s class and became an F-14 and F-18
pilot and just retired. and uh um so
credible guy and knows about uh military
capabilities and he&#39;s his wife has seen
them over to the Catalina channel
repeatedly in broad daylight.
Yeah. And so there there&#39;s this is
what&#39;s happened is so many people are
coming to me credible people average
citizens former military uh personnel
all with their stories and I&#39;ve had
dozens of of this. So it&#39;s it&#39;s
happening more than you&#39;d think. So,
when you were in front of Congress and
they were asking you all these questions
and you were saying stuff like, &#34;Yeah, I
have this answer, but I can&#39;t tell you
unless we&#39;re uh in a private setting or
in a skiff or whatever,
what do you know?&#34;
If I can&#39;t tell them, I wouldn&#39;t tell
you. But it&#39;s really
Do you like Can you do you know [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
that like can put all these questions to
No. So, I wasn&#39;t involved with any UFO
UAP programs. I was not read in. Okay.
So, the reason I talk about this now is
I had my eyewitness account of the Go
Fast video and Ryan
and I had people supporting Ryan
Squadron who seeing these all the time
and here I am. I&#39;m a Navy retired
admiral and people like Fraver and Alex
Dietrich and Ryan are speaking out and
this petty officer Alex Wiggins and I
just felt these these courageous folks
deserve top cover, right? They deserve
someone like me, a retired admiral, cuz
no one else is. I don&#39;t know why, but to
say this is credible. This is a real
thing. It deserves attention and
So, the stuff that you were telling them
uh I guess I imagine that you did
eventually tell them uh what they were
asking you in a private setting. This
stuff was was uh secondhand accounts
that were told explained to you by other
Yes. Yes. And these are people I trust.
In fact, as I told you, I knew people
who touched the legacy program. Mhm. I
I know them and and many of them are out
already. Eric Davis, how put off Joel
Joe J Stratton was not in the legacy
program, but he led the UAP task force.
So, he&#39;s seen a ton of UAP information
that&#39;s not been declassified,
and I trust him. Lu Alzando, I trust
him, too. So, the these these have all
been in the mix. Carl Nell, and they&#39;re
we&#39;re all saying the same thing. There&#39;s
a lot of information that&#39;s being
withheld from the public. some of it,
some of it should be uh released and the
full story.
And what&#39;s stopping what what&#39;s stopping
all this from being released? Like what
what what
it&#39;s it&#39;s the classification issue is
we&#39;re too afraid.
People what are they what are people
scared of?
Well, it&#39;s the government not really
thinking it&#39;s good policy to say we
can&#39;t protect our citizens, our
airspace, our water space. That&#39;s a
tough one to overcome.
Sure, I understand that.
And I&#39;m not sure how they how they
resolve that myself. Again, I&#39;m here
from the standpoint that the American
people were governed by the people for
the people. Uh that they deserve to know
the nature of reality and the government
knows it. They should they should
disclose some of that
to uh to our taxpayers.
And what is to stop like any of these
people who have this top secret
information like from just coming out
and and saying it like what like other
than losing your career?
Jail time. You could go to jail.
Oh yeah. These this is all these are all
But wouldn&#39;t that just confirm it if you
came out if I came out tomorrow and I
was part of some like deep deep access
What we&#39;re talking about is and I I&#39;m
I&#39;ve signed these myself. You get read
into a program and it&#39;s and you have a
non-disclosure form that says I
acknowledge that if I divulge any of the
information in this program and it&#39;s a
prerequisite before getting into the
So you might not even know you&#39;re
getting ready into a UAP program. It
might be, hey, you&#39;re a we think you we
want to have you know about this because
of your responsibilities and we think
you have a need to know.
So first before you get read in sign
this and it says I won&#39;t do anything or
I can go to jail.
Sure. Okay.
Yeah. And actually Yes.
But the problem with that is in public
in the public&#39;s eye if you do come out
and say some crazy stuff that this is
I&#39;m claiming this is true and then you
get thrown into jail people are going to
say, &#34;Oh my god, it&#39;s true. They threw
him in jail.&#34; Yeah.
If it was [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] why would they put
him in jail? Well, so the good thing
here is these these I don&#39;t think I
don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve been passed yet,
but maybe there are I know that uh
Burchchett has introduced some
whistleblower protection legislation to
get around that.
And I&#39;ve heard some of that&#39;s been
subverted, too. Like some of the
whistleblower protection groups or or
fundraisers that people have been
putting together are just like like
intelligence operations just to like as
like like a like a fly trap for
whistleblowers.
I&#39;m pretty sure of it. Yeah. Yeah.
Crazy, man.
I know it. It&#39;s a never a dull moment
with UFOs.
Um, you have a heart out. You got to be
out of here by 4.
I do.
Okay, cool. It&#39;s 3:55. Um, tell people
about your You have a book and some
other stuff that you can uh
Yeah, I I here. Uh, so a lot of what I&#39;m
doing now, I don&#39;t know if you can show
this or not. I got my book cover finally
Oh, beautiful. Hold that up like this.
A little bit higher. There you go.
Holding fast in heavy seas, leadership
for turbulent times.
Yes, I love it.
Well, what happened is as a agency
leader at coming from the military, I
had a lot of of our scientists come up
to me and say, &#34;Hey, uh, I have a tricky
situation. You were a leader. Uh, I
don&#39;t know a lot about leadership
because I haven&#39;t been trained on it.
What are your ideas? What are your
thoughts on leadership?&#34; And this
happened to me almost every day. And so
what I did is I I really just answered
that question in my book is I I go
through what I learned about leadership
in the Navy and and that&#39;s what you do.
You you it&#39;s I love the service because
it&#39;s it&#39;s a officers lead and and that&#39;s
their job and you learn many people
learn how to do it well because they
have great mentors and I go through all
the people that showed me the ropes on
uh on how to be an effective servant
and uh and it&#39;s a good story. Everyone
wants to be a better leader, whether
you&#39;re a dad or a a you know, business
manager. It&#39;s it&#39;s about positively
influencing people you care about,
Uh and so then I go into this agency
called Noah Science Agency. And it was a
challenging time because and I&#39;m a fan
of a lot of what President Trump is
doing right now, but he he&#39;s not an easy
guy to work for and and and inspire uh a
federal workforce. You can see this
right now uh under and uh but but I I
think I did that pretty well because we
succeeded on a lot of fronts. I talked
about our partnership with Victor and
ocean mapping and there were many others
and so I just go through that in this
book to talk about and teach how to lead
during challenging situations
and it was a lot of fun too. I I uh I
had um some great friends and we did
some fun things and so there&#39;s a good
amount of humor because there&#39;s a sea
story behind every
Oh, it&#39;s amazing.
Yes. So,
um, is there gonna be is it available on
Fishing involved.
Oh, hell yeah.
And a lot of scuba diving.
I&#39;m in. Okay.
I&#39;m in. Um, we&#39;ll link it all below.
Great. Um, as well as social media.
What&#39;s what where are you on social
media? Your name?
Oh, uh, LinkedIn. I think it&#39;s Tim
Facebook, Insta. And X, but I&#39;ll have
uh, and it&#39;s Coler Books is publishing
it. I&#39;m just waiting for the DoD uh,
Pentagon review, the security review
that everybody else has to go through
like Lou and Jay. And uh when that&#39;s
done, it&#39;s gonna go hopefully in the
Fantastic, man. Thanks again for your
time, man. This has been fascinating.
Oh, look. He finally found it. Steve,
you&#39;re the man.
Only took an hour. No, I guess my email
is so the very back. That&#39;s Jolly West.
Yep. He was the guy who was the head guy
of MK Ultra and the guy who basically uh
drove Jack Kuby, Jack Ruby insane after
he killed Oswald.
So, a lot of unethical. What was he
doing on the set of 2001 Space Odyssey?
That&#39;s all I want to know.
That&#39;s right. Interesting. I I learned a
Thanks, man. It was great meeting you,
Danny. Hey, do you uh It&#39;s 3:59. Do you
have five minutes to answer some Patreon
questions? Let&#39;s go. All right, let&#39;s do
it. All right, that&#39;s the end of the
podcast. Good night everybody.
