              <li>Jeffrey Sachs came on the show to break down the Ukraine summit and Trump's comments.</li>
              <li>Trump hinted at eliminating mail-in ballots and even floated the idea of suspending elections during wartime.</li>
              <li>He also refused to rule out putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine under "Article 5 style" security guarantees.</li>
              <li>Sachs argued Russia will never accept NATO troops or guarantees inside Ukraine.</li>
              <li>He said Russia's baseline demands are a neutral Ukraine, permanent control of Crimea, and recognition of the four annexed territories.</li>
              <li>Without that, Sachs thinks the war will keep grinding on and Ukraine will keep losing territory.</li>
              <li>Sachs also emphasized that Ukraine has already lost more than a million lives and public opinion there favors ending the war.</li>
              <li>German Chancellor Mertz insisted on a ceasefire before any summit involving Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.</li>
              <li>Sachs dismissed Mertz's stance as unrealistic because Russia won't agree to a ceasefire without major concessions.</li>
              <li>Zelensky, by contrast, sounded more positive toward Trump and stressed the importance of U.S. security guarantees.</li>
              <li>Sachs criticized Zelensky's rule as martial law without real democracy, saying his legitimacy is questionable.</li>
              <li>He also said Zelensky blew a chance for peace in April 2022 when he walked away from the Istanbul talks under U.S. pressure.</li>
              <li>Trump seems to be dangling a big-stage meeting with Putin as leverage to get Zelensky to make concessions.</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, the U.S. slapped tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases, which Sachs called a huge blunder.</li>
              <li>Instead of isolating Russia, the tariffs pushed India closer to Russia and unified the BRICS bloc.</li>
              <li>Sachs said this move destroyed years of U.S. diplomacy with India and proved America can't be trusted as a partner.</li>
              <li>He singled out Lindsey Graham as the "worst senator" and Peter Navarro as incompetent for pushing these policies.</li>
              <li>Breaking Points also reported new details on Israeli official Tom Alexandervich, who was caught in an FBI child sex sting.</li>
              <li>Alexandervich identified himself as an Israeli government official and asked to be flown back to Israel right after arrest.</li>
              <li>Despite being scheduled to meet with the FBI and NSA on cybersecurity, he was quietly allowed to return to Israel while others in the sting faced prosecution.</li>
