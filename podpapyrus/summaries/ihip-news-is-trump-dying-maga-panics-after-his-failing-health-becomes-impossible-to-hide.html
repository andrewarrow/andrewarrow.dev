Cankles, Mc Taco tits, the convicted
felon, president of the United States
health is in rapid rapid decline. There
is a massive cover up going on at the
White House regarding this. But the
rightwing is starting to figure it out
and Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist,
absolute abject piece of is
starting to get to the bottom of it.
Kylie, pop up this headline. We have a
crisis. Alex Jones warns that Trump is
headed for health collapse, a health
collapse. Kylie, now play the clip
because you can see him
declining faster and faster. It&#39;s not
super bad yet,
but unlike Biden that was completely
shot and had all these brain surgeries
and the rest of it, Trump has got great
genetics. He&#39;s tough. And if he takes
care of himself,
he can make it through these years and
then after. But if he doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s
going to have
I predict Trump is going to have some
type of collapse within the next 12
months at the current trajectory. I&#39;m
not saying he&#39;s going to
All right. Deep in the heart of MAGA,
he&#39;s giving Kanks, who I&#39;m going to
refer to him as instead of Cankles, Mc
Taco tits, for expediency and
efficiency. He&#39;s giving Kanks 12 months.
12 months to live. Alex Jones. Well,
here&#39;s the thing. He says a couple
things that are just really odd. It&#39;s
not that bad yet. Alex, it&#39;s terrible.
His ankles are as big as my head. He&#39;s
got bruises on his palm from what I
think they&#39;re giving him IVs. And then
he says he has great jeans. Let&#39;s not
forget his do his father died of
dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s. This man&#39;s
genes tell us exactly where he said it.
In my opinion, and I&#39;m not a doctor,
this is just the fluffery that has to go
on on the right wing. He&#39;s calling out,
it&#39;s clear that Trump has massive health
decline. Not only cognitive, but like
his health. But in order to say
something, he also has to throw in
flattery. Oh my god, he has great jeans.
He&#39;s a stud. He doesn&#39;t have a teeny
weeny. I don&#39;t care what South Park
says. So they always have to throw in
that pornographic fluffery to make sure
they keep the MAGA base hard. All right,
next up you guys. Kanks is actively
hiding the cankles. The Daily Beast is
reporting Donald Trump lashed out at
MSNBC after the network suggested the
79year-old president is taking steps to
hide his cankles from public view. Let&#39;s
You don&#39;t see him sitting at the
fireplace anymore, flanked with a world
leader. Now he&#39;s sitting behind the
oval. When Zalinsky came, he would
normally have had Zalinsky in the chair
like he did when they bullied him, but
then they they were all at a round table
to where the cankles were hidden. He is
actively hiding the cankles. Canks is
hiding his cans. Here&#39;s the thing. I
agree with you 100%. But the fact that I
absolutely positively know it&#39;s true is
because he&#39;s going bananas about it. And
when something triggers him and he gets
defensive, that&#39;s when he goes bananas.
Yeah. And I think, you know, this his
health decline when you combine it with
he has these moments where he&#39;s like,
&#34;I&#39;m trying to get into heaven. People
say I&#39;m not doing well.&#34; Well, who are
these people? the doctors, right?
The doctors are probably saying, you
know, look, we&#39;re trying to give you
blood thinners. We&#39;re trying I mean, I
don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not a physician, but
we&#39;re trying to treat this. All the
blood&#39;s still down in the cankles. And
then he, you know, he gets on online. He
gets online chronically. He&#39;s
chronically online. So, he sees all of
the memes. And then there&#39;s a new one
out where they show Gavin Newsome&#39;s very
slim, very hot, very sculpted ankles
juxtaposed to Kank&#39;s cankles. And you
know that stuff just sends him into
orbit because he cannot be exposed if
you just scratch the slightest bit of a
narcissist surface underneath. And
especially with Canks, it&#39;s just this
boiling, festering evil insecurity that
just comes lashing out. So, the fact
that he&#39;s going after MSNBC after they
did a story on him intentionally hiding
the cankles, you know, it&#39;s true. Okay.
And then here is that&#39;s just the
physical decline, you guys. Now, I want
to segue over to the mental decline.
talking to a radio show host. This is
yesterday about his plans for yesterday
evening. Play the audio. I&#39;m going to be
going out tonight. I&#39;m going to keep it
a secret, but I&#39;m going to go. You&#39;re
the only one that knows you and your
lots of of listeners. You have a great
show. You have a very successful show,
by the way, in case you haven&#39;t heard
that. But uh I&#39;m going to be going out
tonight, I think, with the uh with the
police, with the and with the military,
of course. So, we&#39;re going to do a job.
The National Guard is great. They&#39;ve
done a fantastic job. Okay, here&#39;s the
sitting convicted felon mechanical
mc taco tits calling into radio shows
when we have all of these geopolitical
issues. The markets are collapsing and
uh he&#39;s saying that he is going to go
patrol the streets of Washington DC with
the police and the military and the
national guard. Well, and what an
exercise in stupidity all the way
around. First of all, I hate the
president of the United States calling
in on these radio shows. The
president of the United States should be
solving problems, but he can&#39;t solve
problems because he&#39;s too compromised
mentally. And for him to go out and make
this show, he looks like the biggest
dumbass I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. And
people hate him in DC. Well, and and the
larger narrative that I&#39;m trying to get
out here is the mental decline of this.
Absolutely. to call in. He knows or does
he know? But a pre sitting president of
the United States would know and this is
his second term would be abundantly
aware that he would not be able to go
out in Washington DC on police patrols.
He would know that he couldn&#39;t do that.
That that would be a national security
risk. But it appears to me that he
doesn&#39;t know that. And so we have just
day after day piecing together massive
dementia and cognitive decline that is
not above the fold that is not in the
lead of legacy media. This is something
that if Joe Biden were calling in to
some radio station rambling about going
out in a squad car playing, you know, I
guess they&#39;re all about cosplaying,
cosplaying cops and going out and
arresting people. They would go bananas.
And this is just largely unnoticed.
It&#39;s, oh, it&#39;s just Trump being Trump
and the the the mass cover up of his
supporters, the people surrounding him
at the White House, legacy media that
are actively covering up this man&#39;s
cognitive decline is something I think
that will be studied forever, especially
on the foothills of Jake Tapper, right?
His book about Biden. And listen,
there&#39;s no question Biden was old. I
mean, I saw it with my own eyes. You
could tell he had aged, but it wasn&#39;t
this crazy We&#39;re not we&#39;re not
patrolling the roof of the White House
talking about putting nukes on it. We&#39;re
not talking about Hannibal Lectar. We&#39;re
not giving microphones, I
mean, this guy just gets crazier and
crazier. And so, it&#39;s super important in
this vein, you guys, as we take keep an
eye on what is going on with Kanks. We
have to make sure that we are properly
vetting our news and you as citizens or
you know global citizens make sure
you&#39;re getting the facts and that&#39;s why
every single morning Pumps and I go
straight to ground news and you know the
right-wing losing their mind about
Cracker Barrel and so here&#39;s just a
prime example of what we find on ground
news. The left is reporting the headline
as follows. Cracker Barrel debuted a new
logo and MAGA is pretty mad about it. On
the right, they uh frame it as such.
Cracker Barrel CEO responds to backlash
after ridiculous woke rebrand and it&#39;s
as bad as you imagine. We&#39;re talking
about a restaurant. That&#39;s how dramatic
they make it sound. And the great thing
about um ground news is it tells you who
owns the news source and it tells you
the factuality rating in it. Pumps and I
love that part. She&#39;s always, &#34;Oh, look
at this. It&#39;s mixed factuality or very
low factuality.&#34; And you can imagine
which side when it says lean right, the
low factuality goes down. So listener,

to get your 40% off the ground news
vantage plan that Pumps and I use every
single day. They are subscriberfunded

News. That&#39;s ground gnews.comihip.
Kylie has linked that right below in the
show notes. All right, moving along and
keeping Trump&#39;s dementia and cognitive
decline at the top of the news cycle.
And we need to keep this Epstein.
There&#39;s so many things we have to walk,
chew gum, do cartwheels, all the stuff
all at the same time. But here we have
Kanks going to meet with police in DC.
And this is what he is saying to a group
of policemen. Play the clip.
Good at grass cuz I have a lot of golf
courses all over the place. I know more
about grass than any human being I think
anywhere in the world. And we&#39;re going
to be regrassing all of your parks. All
brand new sprinkler systems. The best
that you can buy. Just like the Augusta.
No doubt. It&#39;ll look like Augusta. It&#39;ll
look like, more importantly, Trump
National Golf Club. That&#39;s even better.
But, uh, we&#39;re going to look, we&#39;re
going to have all brand new, beautiful
grass. You know, like everything else,
grass has a life. Do you know that grass
has a life?
Okay, pause it right there. For those of
you that are listening, you see all the
white crusty men surrounding Trump with
this smug look on their face like, &#34;Oh,
he&#39;s so funny. They&#39;re regrassing. He&#39;s
a grass expert. He has a PhD in grass.
What a riot. That&#39;s a real knee slapper.
And then you see this female police
officer, stone cold, serious. She gets
how ridiculous this is. She&#39;s not
engaging in it. He is demeaning every
single person around him. If he were at
the memory care wing having this
conversation, I get it. If you&#39;re in a
nursing home at the domino table or
playing bingo and you&#39;re rambling on
about being the world&#39;s top grass
expert, it would be a real knee slapper.
You&#39;d leave and you get in the car and
you&#39;d be like, &#34;Papa Hank sure is a
riot. He thinks he knows more about
grass than anybody in the world. Boy,
he&#39;s such a nut.&#34; And you ride home and
you think, &#34;Thank God he doesn&#39;t live
with us and we don&#39;t have to change that
diaper.&#34; Well, in the United States of
America, we trot this guy out who has
militarized the police who are
kidnapping citizens and 71% of the
people that they are kidnapping have
zero criminal record and they&#39;re so
unserious they trot him out and he&#39;s
claiming to be the top expert on grass
in the world. Well, here&#39;s the thing. He
thinks he&#39;s the expert about everything
in the world. Just going back to the
photo for a minute, Doug Berman, his
face. I looked at that. Kylie, will you
put that back up?
It looked like love. It looks like love.
Look at that. And these are the alpha
alpha alpha males. Twitter. Pause it.
Far right. The guy on the far right.
It looks like love worship. It is
cultlike love. It is broke back
mountain. I can&#39;t quit you love is what
that is. This is pathetic. This is an
American face plant. These people are
abject abject That&#39;s all we
have. We&#39;re going to have more drops
today. But listen up. Support Pumps and
Me, you guys. We&#39;re trying to keep
everybody sane, keep you laughing, keep
you focused. The best way to support us
is to go purchase our book, if you can
believe it. Two old Broads Wrote a book.
It&#39;s called Life is a Lazy Susan of
Sandwiches. And you can click our link

little weekend read. We&#39;ll see you all
