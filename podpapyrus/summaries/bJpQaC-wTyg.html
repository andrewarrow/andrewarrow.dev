We and many others in the media for the
past few months have been saying that
when you normalize masked law
enforcement officers just rolling up on
people uh and effectively throwing them
in the back of a van and carting them
away. That is going to be very appealing
to people who want to commit crimes.
Those who are just as xenophobic, just
as racist as some of the people doing it
with a badge but don&#39;t have the badge
can use the fact that that&#39;s a thing
that&#39;s happening now to do it
themselves. And we warned about that and
it is evidently happening. There have
been at least three instances that
Huffpost has compiled, let alone uh
others that might be out there of men
impersonating ICE agents in order to
specifically target and hurt women. And
we&#39;re going to tell you about those
cases. There is a North Carolina man
reportedly posed as law enforcement and
threatened to deport an immigrant woman
before he kidnapped and raped her. In
Maryland, a man allegedly approached a
Latina woman in a parking lot, flashed a
fake ICE badge, and told her to get into
his car or face deportation. He
reportedly raped the woman in his car
before law enforcement was called. A New
York man allegedly posing as an ICE
agent punched a woman in broad daylight
and then tried to rape her before
stealing her phone and her purse. And
one would think that after these dark
predictions started coming true in
states around America. Well, obviously
something needs to change. ICE policy
needs to change. They need to stop uh
masking themselves, making it so that
you can&#39;t see what their name is, be a
little bit more clear about their
identification, their badge, the legal
right to be doing what they&#39;re doing.
But obviously that&#39;s not happening. And
so we need to appeal to the leadership
which is for some reason uh Christy
Gnome I guess is in charge of this. And
so the Democratic Women&#39;s Caucus has uh
they&#39;ve appealed to her to do something
about this. And we&#39;re going to we&#39;re
going to read to you a little bit of the
letter that they sent. I just want to be
very clear. Christine does not care at
all at all if migrants are being
assaulted or raped if US citizens are
being assaulted or raped. And if the
policy that she&#39;s not only pursuing when
it comes to ICE, but participating in
doing cosplay, like she&#39;s one of the
officers or whatever, if that&#39;s enabling
this, she doesn&#39;t care. But I&#39;m glad
that the Democratic Women&#39;s Caucus is at
least trying to appeal to a better
nature that she does not possess. So 33
members of that caucus uh signed it.
They shared it with Huffost and said
that I they they urged ICE agents to
visibly and clearly identify themselves
when conducting immigration enforcement
activities to stop enabling
impersonators who leverage women&#39;s
uncertainty and fear of immigration
consequences to rape, harass, and abuse
them. And the letter also says this,
&#34;All our lives we are taught to fear
masked men in unmarked vehicles. We
learn we should run from such men to
avoid being kidnapped, sexually
assaulted, or killed. Yet, ICE is
increasingly conducting raids and
arrests and masks, plain clothes without
visible identification or badges using
unmarked vehicles, tactics that cause
confusion, terror, and mistrust among
the public. And thus far there has been
no response whatsoever from Christino
who doesn&#39;t give a damn about this
because uh unfortunately the Democratic
Women&#39;s Caucus needs to understand that
appeals to protect women are only useful
if it&#39;s used as a weapon against trans
people, if it&#39;s used to police what
happens in women&#39;s sports or whatever.
Outside of that, they do not care and
they&#39;re not remotely interested. And so
you&#39;re likely to see a lot more of this.
And all of this is being brought to you
by this insane policy that never should
have begun in the first place. And I do
also want to remind everyone that while
uh people who are not a member of ICE or
Border Patrol or law enforcement are
using all of this to abuse these women,
never forget that the people with the
badges also abuse those women. And
sexual assault is a constant in these
detainment facilities. Um and not just
under Donald Trump, by the way. This
goes back. It&#39;s throughout
administrations. It happens in prisons.
It happens in immigration detention
facilities. This is just a new form of
sexual assault that women need to face
being attached to all of this. Sharon,
what do you make of all this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, what you related is it&#39;s
chilling because I had these thoughts
that, well, John, we don&#39;t know the half
of it. This is so convenient to deviant
souls who wish to commit these kinds of
crimes. It&#39;s easy. You might even have
sympathy from onlookers if you&#39;re in the
right jurisdiction. And I think that the
population that they&#39;re targeting is not
even reporting all of it. Not by a long
shot. So this is absolutely disgusting
and chilling. You&#39;re right. I mean, I
guess they had to try it with Christine
Gnome, but she could care less. I mean,
she shot a puppy. Come on. In a gravel
pit. Is it? She doesn&#39;t care. Steal her
bag at a restaurant while the Secret
Service or whoever is guarding her is
around. Now that she cares about
although she has plenty of money. Okay.
This is again devaluing life. Women, men
too, as you mentioned in these centers.
The the gay hairdresser who came back.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, he talked about how he was
sexually violated. It&#39;s torture. It&#39;s
disgusting. And when will the targeting
stop? Every day there&#39;s another upping
of the ante. Like, oh yeah, there&#39;s more
fallout here. It&#39;s gross.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, I&#39;m
going to be doing a short uh later on
today, so look for that. Uh responding
to uh SEC Cup, who&#39;s angry at the
Democrats for uh constantly pointing out
that crime is down. Uh evidently the
Democrats are falling into a trap by not
just like meekly going along with
Trump&#39;s fascist propaganda or whatever.
Um and I&#39;m going to say, uh uh thank you
for your opinion, SCP, but no, I&#39;m going
to continue to point out what&#39;s actually
happening. Uh we&#39;re going to point out
when there are lies about criminal
activity and we&#39;re going to point out
when there&#39;s actual criminal activity
and when all of this is going on and
Donald Trump&#39;s answers. Instead, I&#39;m
going to post hundreds of soldiers
around the National Mall. By the way,
tons being posted in areas that have
literally not had a single crime
reported this year. Then we&#39;re going to
point out to people that he&#39;s not
interested in fighting crime. He is
interested in fascist imagery. That&#39;s
it. He himself is a criminal. He is
pardoning criminals. He has filled his
administration with criminals. And his
uh insane xenophobic immigration policy
is helping to facilitate further crime
and exploitation of women. That&#39;s what
I&#39;m going to do. Now, I don&#39;t have a
fancy show on cable news like she does.
She can use her time how she wants. She
can misuse her time how she wants. But
that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do with our
little YouTube channel. And with that
said, we&#39;re going to move now to um what
is uh I guess a growing genre of news,
which is uh MAGA and members of MAGA
finding out uh all too late that their
love of Donald Trump is not necessarily
going to save them. And by the way, um
people saying that I should interview
John Oliver. No, I I I&#39;d like to. I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen. That&#39;s
not the problem necessarily. I would
like to hang out with him. I would like
to I want to be friends with him, but I
just I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen.
I don&#39;t think he knows who I am. But
anyway, with that, why don&#39;t we jump
into this next story? We have covered so
many Trump supporters getting utterly
screwed over by their God Emperor and uh
most of them, this is the most tragic
part of it, afterward love him just as
much as they did before. Far rarer is
the time in which they are screwed over
and they learn as a result of it. And we
have an example of that today. So this
is two Trump voters who alleged that
border patrol agents racially profiled
them after they were stopped and
questioned while they were driving to
the dentist and they were treated
horribly. They were also treated as tons
of people are treated across America
every day under the Trump
administration. But in this particular
case, it did get through to them. So
let&#39;s talk about their experience. This
is George and as Esmeralda Doyles, both
US citizens for all the good that does
you in a lawless society like America
2025. They were driving to an
appointment in Southern California when
a dark SUV started to follow them.
George told a San Diego NBC affiliate
that the SUV put on a siren, pulled them
over, and a group of masked Border
Patrol agents got out to question them.
Why did they have to be in masks? God
only knows. I guess because they&#39;re
doing things that you wouldn&#39;t want to
be identified with, I suppose. They said
that they had uh the the Doyles said
that they&#39;d been scoping out potential
camping sites in the area on the way to
the dental appointment. See, they had
made the mistaken assumption that in
America as a citizen, you can go to the
dentist and you can plan a vacation.
Maybe you could have at some point. You
can&#39;t freely do that today. Don&#39;t worry,
they&#39;ve gotten that message. And so a
border patrol agent questioned uh the
husband through the car window saying,
&#34;If you have a dentist appointment, it
probably wasn&#39;t the best idea to be out
in the middle of nowhere.&#34; And he said,
&#34;We have the right to travel anywhere we
want to travel.&#34; To which the guy says,
&#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. You do. And I
actually have the right and authority to
stop you.&#34; It&#39;s called reason. It&#39;s
called reasonable suspicion. Reasonable.
So the reasonable sus suspicion is that
they were in an area where he thought
there wasn&#39;t much going on. So I guess
you can&#39;t be there. And then let&#39;s also
of course acknowledge their race. That
is the obvious unavoidable part of this.
Tom Hman told us and the lawyers for the
Trump administration are appealing to
the Supreme Court. Please just get off
our back and let us racially profile
people. We&#39;re going to do it anyway.
Just give it the stamp of approval. And
so that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing right here.
Now, they said that there was a known
alien who had been detected in the area.
Well, hold up. You just said that there
was nothing around there. So, what has
he been living in the brush or
something? And oh, so you suspect that
there&#39;s an alien in a geographic area so
you could racially profile anyone you
want? Again, that&#39;s not how a modern de
democracy is supposed to work. It is,
unfortunately, how America works right
now. He also said that they had aroused
suspicion by making several Uturns which
again add this to the list of things
that you might have thought that you
could do but you cannot do in America
anymore. And in the wake of the incident
uh which left George terrified and his
wife shaking and crying, the couple said
that they regretted their votes for
Trump, saying quote, &#34;I feel shame,
guilt, and anger at the same time
because of the promises that he made
that he lied to us about going after the
worst of the worst. He lied on those and
he stole our vote and they are 100%
right. Sharon, what do you think?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am trying to remember I I told you
Jenk kind of changed my heart and mind a
little bit like well Sharon don&#39;t assume
that people always are watching the same
sources or know the same things. Uh he
did tell them he did lie and say we&#39;re
going after the worst of the worst. I&#39;m
not celebrating that they&#39;re now
terrified and regretful. I am
celebrating that. Well, actually, I am
celebrating that they&#39;re regretful
because it means they&#39;ve at least
learned something here. You have people
who&#39;s we profiled a guy whose wife was
was taken away. She&#39;s not the lowest of
the low, the worst of the worst, and
still plans to vote for a known liar
and, you know, he&#39;s got those other
crimes, convictions. I just I don&#39;t get
it. Sometimes I do believe that people
who come from other places that are far
more restrictive, I don&#39;t know if we
could put the word far in front of it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are grateful for what they have. And so
if you want to restrict them a little
bit, it&#39;s not like back home. I don&#39;t
understand some of these people. I I
don&#39;t I can&#39;t identify with them. But
it&#39;s going to get a whole lot worse for
more people like that. And let&#39;s hope
more wake up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I Yeah. Again, I like you had said
with the thing with Jenk, we can&#39;t we
can&#39;t know what people pay attention to
like like that if they pay attention at
all, which is difficult. It&#39;s a luxury
to be able to follow the news on a
regular basis, let alone where they get
their news from. I mean, they could
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that they&#39;re doing that by watching F. I
mean, I watch the news and you learn
absolutely nothing because it&#39;s just
propaganda. It&#39;s state sponsored
propaganda. Um, and some people they it
takes a certain thing to get them to pay
attention. So, I try to bear that in
mind. Uh, sometimes when I&#39;m not
thinking about that though, I am
astounded that a person can have made it
to this last election and not know a
thousand times more than you need to
know about Donald Trump to know
everything you need to know about him as
president. But that said, they do regret
it. Uh thankfully they were eventually
released, so that&#39;s good. And I&#39;m I&#39;m
assuming their political activity in the
future will probably be different. But
either way, nobody should be treated
like this. This is not the way our soci
society is supposed to work. And uh I
think that more and more people are
going to realize that more and more
people are going to maybe get
uncomfortable with like, yeah, remember
when like you could like be in a city
and there weren&#39;t soldiers everywhere?
Like why is why is that like this is not
America? Okay. And hopefully people&#39;s
attachment to the the abstract concept
of what our society is supposed to be
overrules the propaganda and the lies,
the fear-mongering uh by Donald Trump.
