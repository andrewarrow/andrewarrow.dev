Hi guys, my name is Haley Gossaran. For
those who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m on
Netflix&#39;s new show, Building a Band, a
lot of people have wanted me to share my
story. So, after reliving everything on
national TV, let&#39;s talk about my
experience. What most people don&#39;t know
is while filming, I was going through
the hardest time of my life because my
mom was battling breast cancer. And I
was fortunate I got to be with her
throughout her chemo treatments and her
first surgery. I wasn&#39;t going to do the
show originally because I didn&#39;t want to
leave her, but she encouraged me and
wanted me to do it and said seeing me do
my thing on TV would make her happy. At
the time, being 20 across the world in
the UK without my phone in a high stress
situation was not easy. I opened up to
my bandmates about my mom having cancer,
which was hard for me to share, but I
really needed support and I hope to
build connection on top of what I was
dealing with personally. If you watch
the show, you can see a glimpse of how I
was treated. And through it all, I
decided to stay positive, kind, and
empathetic because that&#39;s just who I am.
A lot of people asked how I was able to
handle everything. And as hard as it got
at times, all I wanted to do was keep
the peace and try to make it work. When
you&#39;re dealing with real life problems,
you really don&#39;t have the energy to deal
with negativity. I went in so excited to
build a band. I&#39;m a team player, and I
really wanted us all to shine together.
I&#39;ve always been a girl&#39;s girl and I was
really hoping to form that kind of
sisterhood and supportive friendship
that we saw in the other bands. You
didn&#39;t see one person trying to be the
boss or make all the decisions. And I
think that&#39;s why they worked so well
together because they had that mutual
respect and balance that we lacked.
During filming, I stayed focused on
keeping grounded and tried to do my best
given the circumstances. After the show,
I continued to give grace and hoped that
even if building a van didn&#39;t work for
us, that maybe building a friendship
could. And there were fun moments
outside of working together. I&#39;m a very
forgiving person. And even though I was
treated poorly at times, I try to
overlook it, but watching the show back
and seeing the full picture, and hearing
comments in solo interviews that I was
unaware of was eye opening. A lot of the
remarks that were made don&#39;t align with
me personally, and watching it back was
very difficult. At the time, I didn&#39;t
realize how much I was letting slide. I
didn&#39;t want any tension since we did
have to live and work together, but you
can really only brush things under the
rug for so long before you have to
protect your peace. I&#39;ve been through a
lot of unfortunate things in my life and
it&#39;s made me mentally stronger. I think
it takes a lot of strength to not lash
back out, especially when you&#39;re being
talked down to or disrespected. Even
though my friends and family were upset
about the way I was treated, they&#39;re so
proud of the way I carried myself
throughout the show. My story and who I
am as an artist wasn&#39;t shown, but I&#39;m so
happy I have my platform so you guys can
get to know me more. I absolutely loved
working with the glam team along with
the crew and meeting all the other bands
and judges. I&#39;m so grateful for this
opportunity. And to my bandmates, we had
our ups and downs, but I&#39;m very thankful
for the growth and the lessons we shared
along the way. Anyone going through a
difficult time, never give up. Keep
going because it&#39;s only going to make
you stronger. And remember, kindness
always wins. Now for the fun stuff. I&#39;m
so excited to keep sharing my journey,
not just as a singer, but as an artist
and an actress. I have some really
special projects coming up, including
new music and some fun TV and film roles
I can&#39;t wait to share. Thank you so much
for the love and support. It really
means the world to me.
