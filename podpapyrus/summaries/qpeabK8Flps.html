streamer destiny may be legally trapped
as we look at this new scandal and we&#39;re
turning to what may be criminal charges.
Of course, I&#39;m Andrew Esquire, American
Attorney. This is Legal Mindset. We
teach you to be your own judge. Of
course, it&#39;s a fast facts version. Give
you the quick and dirty and the latest
of legal news. If you like this version,
if you like the fast facts, make sure
you like the video and leave a comment
on the video below. So, as always, we
have a nice PowerPoint for you here
today to kind of walk you through this
uh situation with Destiny. Now, once
again, uh I&#39;m going to give a content
warning because this is once again a
very serious topic. I unfortunately I&#39;ve
been covering some very serious topics
lately that involve deep materials uh
and deep subjects that can be sensitive
to some people. So, if you are very uh
sensitive to this thing and anything
involving um you know explicit materials
involving minors, this might not be the
topic for you. I&#39;m going to refer to it
as CSAM. I know people like to use the
cute cheese pizza stuff and it&#39;s you
know good enough for an emoji or
something else somewhere, but I&#39;m going
to use CSAM because that&#39;s the
professional designation and uh it just
talks about it in a more professional
way. So, that&#39;s what I try to go for on
my channel. Please be respectful in both
the live chat and in the comments below
and I would deeply appreciate that as
this has affected many people and this
is something that really is uh truly
hurtful uh to a large percentage of the
world population. So let&#39;s go into the
introduction. First of all, I previously
covered his ongoing civil lawsuit. So
you can check out my previous video for
that information. Uh however, this does
relate and not relate to his ongoing
lawsuit with Pixie. Of course, this will
be information that Pixie&#39;s lawyers will
be very interested in getting at, and
there&#39;ll be all sorts of twists and
turns, but what I&#39;m going to really
focus on today is the latest controversy
and the legal issues presented. So, I&#39;m
not focusing on the interstream drama.
There&#39;s a lot of stuff going on. I&#39;m not
going to bring up, you know, St. Per,
right? It really doesn&#39;t have anything
to do with him or what Ethan Klein
thinks or anybody else. It really has to
do with destiny and the legal hot water
that he&#39;s put himself into. So, that&#39;s
our focus today. And the last thing I&#39;m
going to say, and I&#39;ve said this before,
is like with all of my videos, I have no
personal bias or anything against for
Destiny. And frankly, I don&#39;t care how
this turns out. So, it really isn&#39;t
something that I&#39;m for or against. And
what I want to say is if you&#39;re a fan of
Destiny, if you&#39;re a Destiny fan who&#39;s
tuning in to watch this, right, please
watch this with an open mind because
this both presents the challenges, the
things he stepped in, as well as, hey,
what can he do moving forward? Because
at this point, you&#39;re at where you&#39;re
at. So, what do you do? So, listen to it
with an open mind. Whether you&#39;re for or
against Destiny, whatever side you&#39;re
on, just try to focus on the law and
what is objective in here because all of
this is really objective information.
So, let&#39;s get into explaining the
controversy. Now, you guys can go over
watch this 4-minute video I reported
Destiny to the Police by Willie Mack.
Uh, if you want to see the whole video,
I&#39;ll have it on my live version. You can
watch the whole thing there. But as a
quick summary um on this expose video,
the streamer Willie Mack contacted
Destiny when Rose seemingly was
confirmed as underage was confirmed on a
third party uh as being underage at the
time and when explicit material is being
shared with her. So this woman, this
girl is underage and you know receiving
explicit material that&#39;s uh not
something that&#39;s good. So, uh, they
were, you know, talking and as part of
that voluntary conversation, once again,
Destiny chose, this is a big deal. He
voluntarily engaged with Willie. There
was no legal obligation. This was not a
deposition. This was not something that
was required by any court of law. This
is something he did because he just
wanted to talk. He just wanted to get it
out there. And this is a very common
problem for streamers because they often
talk about stuff and get themselves in a
hot water. And that&#39;s exactly what
happened here today. Destiny voluntarily
commented likely without consulting his
lawyer. I&#39;m I&#39;m almost certain that he
did not talk to his lawyer before he
talked to Willie Mack. And he shared a
video where Rose apparently, according
to all the data, appeared to be underage
at the time. Therefore, he shared an
adult video, of course, a piece of it.
He didn&#39;t share the actual video file
itself, but he had the file name and he
had a top of the video where she was
underage and stated, &#34;Hey, yeah, I&#39;ve
got this. I&#39;ve still got this this uh
information. I&#39;ve got this on my
computer, right? Where this girl is
apparently a minor. Therefore, this
would be what would appear to be CSAM.
I&#39;ve got that on my computer. And
Destiny&#39;s defense to that, his kind of
push back when he was questioned by
Willie was, &#34;Oh, I have a legal duty. I
have a legal obligation to preserve
evidence.&#34; So, of course, Willie turned
around and then reported Destiny to the
police in addition to making a video,
four-minute video, uh, which I&#39;ll put in
the description below. So what happened
afterwards? Well, of course, Destiny uh
goes and fights back. He goes and
comments back saying almost everything I
DM is wrong. Willie Mack is running
cover. He goes in on Ethan Klein. He
goes it on Hassan. He says he has no
CSAM on his computer. I&#39;ve only complied
with my legal obligations
for my court cases. The 60 uh gigabyte
screenshot was read to a claim that
someone whose name and birthday have yet
to be reliably confirmed. Well, I think
that&#39;s where the problem is. It seems
like that indeed has been confirmed
according to sources out there. And if
those sources are correct, if those
sources have indeed pulled up the right
information, then it appears that if
that is confirmed, that would indeed be
CCM. So, he may be asserting that it&#39;s
not based on a mistake of fact, which
we&#39;ll talk about today. However, that
can entirely change things legally. So,
let&#39;s get into how this splices legally.
So, preservation of evidence. So,
channel uh fans and you guys out there
know the term. You&#39;re big fans of my
channel. You know the term spoilation.
You guys know about that. I&#39;ve taught
you that uh because it comes up time and
time again with people deleting
evidence. I talked about that in the
Ethan Klein case with the Reddit and
Discord mods trying to delete stuff,
right? Or hide stuff or denims or
anybody else trying to hide stuff. That
would be spolation. If they&#39;re trying to
delete evidence, hide evidence, that is
a problem because once a lawsuit com uh
starts, whether it&#39;s civil or criminal,
does not matter. You have a duty to
preserve evidence. And that applies to
all evidence, physical, digital,
anything relevant to the case. That&#39;s
very broad, right? Anything relevant
broadly, you have to preserve. So any
attempt to hide or punish or uh destroy
that evidence, anything you&#39;re that&#39;s
relevant and you try to hide it or
destroy it, you can be punished by the
court, including criminally for trying
to hide or destroy evidence. So Destiny,
when he said he has a legal duty, you
know, and listen up, Destiny fans,
Destiny is right about that here. But
however, pause. He&#39;s sort of right about
that and he&#39;s forgetting about all those
other duties that are out there and all
those other responsibilities. He&#39;s
forgetting about privilege. And this is
where I think he did not talk to his
lawyer because if his lawyer knew he was
going to have this conversation, he
would have certainly said no because it
made his job a living hell. Let&#39;s talk
about that. So, let&#39;s talk about cander
to the tribunal. A lot of people know
about attorney client privilege. If you
watch Breaking Bad, you know, with Saul
Goodman, Put a Dollar Pocket, Engage
Confidentiality, and attorney
confidentiality is strong. It&#39;s very
strong, but it&#39;s not unbreakable. There
is supposed to be theoretically a
balance. Now, of course, I will say this
too, different lawyers are different and
take different ethical stances on what
is uh what is, you know, confidential
and what they need to disclose to the
court. But you actually need to balance
what&#39;s called cander to the tribunal,
which means confidentiality is on one
side and cander to the tribunal, the
court on the other side. You have to be
honest with the court. As a lawyer, you
can&#39;t lie to the court. If you know you
are lying, you cannot do that. So there
is a duty to report facts such as
criminal behavior, criminal conduct or
fraudulent conduct, perjury, fraud to
the court. All of these things you have
to report. So if the lawyer knows, you
have to report it. And that&#39;s the key
there, right? That&#39;s the key. The lawyer
does not have to report mere suspicion.
So if you only suspect something, you
don&#39;t have to report that. But if you
actually know it, if you know it&#39;s true,
what you&#39;re like, I know this as a fact,
you do have to report that. So the
problem is, are you seeing the problem
here? This moved from something his
lawyer may have suspected because we do
or don&#39;t know this person&#39;s age to oh
yeah this person was factually underage
therefore this is factually cessent.
That completely changes the dynamic from
something the lawyer might not have to
report because he doesn&#39;t know one way
or another to something he&#39;d say well
now we&#39;ve got to talk about this. Now
we&#39;ve got to disclose this to the court.
It&#39;s a mandatory disclosure. It&#39;s no
longer an elective disclosure. That&#39;s a
problem. That&#39;s a big problem for the
lawyer. The other problem is we&#39;ve got
privilege. So any information that had
been protected by attorney client
privilege, that super strong privilege.
You can throw lawyers in jail and they
don&#39;t have to break attorney client
privilege, that duty is absolutely waved
when you speak to a third party, when
you disclose to a third party. Now,
there&#39;s a difference between inadvertent
accidental and intentional disclosure.
If you accidentally leak something, if
it was something that, &#34;Oh my god, I fax
somebody something. I should have faxed
him that.&#34; Okay, you might get away. Who
uses a fax anyways? Well, the Japanese
do. It&#39;s a It&#39;s a Japanese thing, guys.
Trust me, I&#39;m in Asia. But you
accidentally send something over an
accidental email, whatever else. That
may still apply, right? There&#39;s no
guarantee. You might have waved that
privilege, right? It&#39;s possible you
still wave it, but there&#39;s an argument
that the attorney client privilege is
preserved. However, if you leak
information intentionally, privilege is
lost forever. So, here&#39;s the issue. He
spoke to Willie Mack voluntarily. There
was no obligation. There was no court
order. There was no gun to his head.
There&#39;s no duress. There was no money.
There was no nothing. There&#39;s nothing
going on here, right? There wasn&#39;t any
sort of situation where this could be
argued as an inadvertent disclosure.
This was an intentional disclosure,
fully intentional. There&#39;s no way this
was not voluntary. So that&#39;s the
problem. All the privilege on this is
waved now. So all of you, for example,
talking about Pixie and that lawsuit,
they can come after that because there&#39;s
no privilege on that anymore. That&#39;s
just wide open. So, let&#39;s talk a little
bit more about applying this uh to the
law. Let&#39;s talk about mistake of fact.
So, Destiny argues that he lacked the u
men&#39;s rehea, right? He lacked the intent
to commit the crime because he had an
honest and reasonable misunderstanding
of a factual circumstance at the time of
the act. That&#39;s the defense of mistake
of act. This is a defense that comes up
particularly to specific intent crimes.
So, the best example was let&#39;s say you
had a very expensive jacket. Let&#39;s say
it&#39;s a designer jacket and you picked up
a jacket at you&#39;re in a place that&#39;s
cold so you have to put the you know
when you come in in the winter you put
your jackets up front and you take
somebody else&#39;s jacket maybe it&#39;s their
Canada Goose jacket whatever it is I
don&#39;t know what&#39;s trending nowadays but
you take their their expensive jacket
and it&#39;s not yours. Well, that&#39;s a true
mistake of fact. You did not know it was
identical. It was a genuine honest
mistake. It&#39;s a reasonable mistake a
reasonable regular person can make.
You&#39;re not going to go to jail for that.
typically, right? Uh, however, however,
that&#39;s only for certain types of crimes.
So, there are certain types of crimes
called strict liability. So, most but
not all uh criminal charges related to
CSAM are strict liability. And what that
means is with strict liability, strict
liability means your state of mind does
not matter. So, your specific intent
does not matter. Now, that&#39;s not all
charges. Some of them it does related to
CCM, some of it doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s other
lawyers, you know, shout out to uh some
of my friends out there in Law Tube that
have gone over the long list of
potential crimes. There are some that
don&#39;t require it and some that do,
right? It&#39;s a mix and it&#39;s really up to
prosecutors what they&#39;re thinking about,
what they go for. That&#39;s not in the
control of any streamer. It&#39;s not in the
control of Ethan Klein or Hassan or
anybody else. It&#39;s in the control of the
prosecutors to decide, hey, why why are
we going to how are we going to go after
Destiny? If we go after Destiny, that&#39;s
up to them. And mistake of fact and
mistake of law defenses typically do not
work for strict liability crimes. They
typically are not a defense. However,
there are exceptions. Of course, there&#39;s
a very complex and specific area of law.
There&#39;s lawyers that dedicate their
entire career just to this. I am not one
of them, but I will give you an overview
of some of the defenses that Destiny
might bring up. So, of course, uh
there&#39;s two main ones he might bring up.
The first one is, of course, not having
intent, and that would block anything
with specific intent. So, saying, &#34;Hey,
um I genuinely believe this person was
an adult, not a child, and argue, I
don&#39;t have the intent to possess or
distribute.&#34; So, a lot of the possession
or distribute uh statutes might involve
some specific intent to distribute. So,
okay, I don&#39;t have the intent to
distribute, so it&#39;s not going to be a
distribution charge. The other one is
negating the element, uh regarding
child. So there&#39;s usually language
saying, &#34;Okay, this is a child.&#34; So even
if it doesn&#39;t require specific intent,
it say it requires that that person be a
child. So if you say, &#34;Hey, I honestly
didn&#39;t believe they were a child,&#34; you
would negate that element of the crime,
even if it isn&#39;t specific intent. I know
it sounds complicated, but it&#39;s it&#39;s
just taking out that one little piece.
Once again, not guaranteed, not
foolproof, not something you can
necessarily get away with. I&#39;m just
saying and presenting out there as
always professionally, hey, here&#39;s the
the attack. Here&#39;s the defense, right?
And it doesn&#39;t look good for Destiny.
This does not look good. So, my
conclusion is Destiny is certainly now
under criminal scrutiny. Absolutely.
There&#39;s been a report. So, law
enforcement is looking into it.
Absolutely, without a doubt. Um, and
this is in addition to his civil case.
So, this has gone from something that is
purely civil to something that is now
potentially criminal. He gains nothing
debating with people on the internet.
And uh as much as I can tell him and
I&#39;ll probably make a short or something
else like that. Hey, look, this isn&#39;t
useful. I I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s factual.
I say it all the time. I put out the
meme there on X. Shut up. Shut up. Shut
up. He probably won&#39;t because that&#39;s his
MO and that&#39;s what he&#39;s been doing for
the longest time. Uh but that really
isn&#39;t going to help because it&#39;s not up
to Willie Mack anymore. It&#39;s not up to
his son or Ethan or anybody or myself
even. Arguing with me doesn&#39;t really
help. The only thing that helps is to
fully disclose information to his
lawyer. Stop talking. you know,
definitely don&#39;t give any other
interviews and possibly engage a
specialist lawyer. But even doing all
that, there&#39;s no guarantee and Destiny
is certainly in for a very bumpy ride. I
want to know what you guys think about
this in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one.
