Today, Democrats pushed back against
President Trump&#39;s plan to send National
Guard troops to more cities, including
Chicago, New York, and Baltimore. State
and local leaders say they have crime
under control. CBS&#39;s Willie James Emmen
is at the White House tonight with the
very latest on this back and forth.
Willie James.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Jerica, good evening to you. Democratic
leaders are calling the president&#39;s
threats to deploy troops in American
cities unconstitutional.
On Sunday, President Trump and Maryland
Governor West Moore engaged in a war of
words over the issue of crime. Trump
posting on social media, quote, &#34;If Wes
Moore needs help, I will send in the
troops, which is being done in nearby
DC, and quickly clean up the crime.&#34;
Moore pushed back in an interview on
Face the Nation. It is so frustrating
when we&#39;re hearing from the president of
the United States something that is just
purely performative without actually
focusing on these communities and these
neighborhoods who believe that progress
is possible. The public lashing follows
the Maryland governor&#39;s criticism of the
National Guard troop deployment in the
nation&#39;s capital and an invitation he
sent Trump to visit Baltimore where
officials say violent crime is down.
Trump has blasted Baltimore and other
Democraticrun cities as crimeridden and
threatened to send in the military.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I think Chicago will be our next and
then we&#39;ll help with uh New York.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This weekend, the Washington Post
reported the Pentagon is drawing up
plans for a possible military deployment
in Chicago. Governor JB Pritsker says
the president is trying to manufacture a
crisis and Illinois did not ask for
federal help. Chicago&#39;s mayor says
violent crime is down in his city.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The president does not have the
constitutional or legal authority uh to
federalize the National Guard here in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, President Trump has a lot more
power in Washington DC, but presidents
can federalize state national guards
elsewhere in an emergency like Trump did
in June in Los Angeles. Jerica. All
right, Willie James, thank
