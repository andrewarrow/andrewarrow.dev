So, this story right here is wild, man.
Uh, I don&#39;t know how many of you guys
have heard of this. I bet a bunch of you
have by now, but um, there&#39;s this
streaming platform called Kick. And, you
know, I guess they originally were
basically competition to Twitch. Twitch
was known for having some sort of like,
I guess, strict rules around what they
allow and what they don&#39;t allow and what
they suspend and and all that stuff. And
so, Kick was like, &#34;Hey, we&#39;re more of a
free-for-all. We&#39;re more of a wild west
type situation over here. The rules are
more lenient.&#34; And um you know, you have
a bunch of people stream on kick. I
guess Aiden Ross, I guess, is one who&#39;s
one of the most prominent people who
streams on kick. Um but you have you had
a horrible thing that happened, you
know, the other day where there&#39;s this
uh group of French guys, I guess, in
their 20s and and 30s. They look at
least like they&#39;re in their 20s and 30s.
And what they did is they had this
stream marathon where they have this one
guy who&#39;s a little slow who&#39;s part of
their group. His name is Jean Pormanov.
And um they basically like humiliated
this guy, hit him, forcefed him some
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that may have been toxic.
Effectively, they tortured dude on air
and I believe it was supposed to be like
a 10day stream or something like that.
They tortured him on air. Um, and the
apparently the whole point of this this
group is literally just like torturing
this guy, right? That&#39;s the whole point.
And so they had some marathon like 10day
stream where they were doing exactly
that. And come to find out, dude was
tortured to death. Now, I think uh it
was probably my guess is that it the
death was probably more because of
something that they gave him some like
toxic thing that they made him swallow.
Uh so he died from whatever substance he
was forced to ingest. But the whole
story is just absolutely catastrophic
because the fact that this was allowed
in the first place is wild. And by the
way, you go do yourself a favor and go
watch the ABA and preach video on this
because in that they speak French and
obviously these are French dreamers and
so they can understand what they&#39;re
saying in their native tongue. And
like there were moments where the idea
that oh the guy was in on it and he was
just having fun and he was like cool
with it and everything. That&#39;s not true.
There were moments where the guy like
tried to fight back and and panicked and
said like you know this is going too far
and and stop it. Uh there was also a
just a horrible thing about
communication he had with his mother
where his mother was concerned for him
and saying, you know, this has gone too
far. You got to you got to shut this
down. And Jean Pormanov was like, I
don&#39;t think they&#39;re not letting me
leave. Like they&#39;re not letting me
leave. So he was basically like
kidnapped and tortured to death. And it
was all while
a lot of people were watching it. A lot
of people were watching it and seemingly
enjoying it. Right. I said to Crystal
that this story makes Remember the
Remember the show Jackass? The MTV show
Jackass? If you&#39;re around my age, you
do. But this makes those guys look like
angels cuz those guys, you know, they
were doing crazy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] but you know, 99%
of the time they&#39;re doing crazy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
where like only it&#39;s only your own
health and safety on the line, right?
And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re torturing
somebody else and forcing them to do
something they don&#39;t want to do. So just
a horrible, horrible scenario. But then
we also learned this. Ready? Look at
this. Kick founder and CEO Ed Craraven
is listed as the fifth top donator to
Jean Pormanov, the man who recently died
mid-life stream on the site. Viewers
would give subs as acts of violence and
physical and moral humiliation were
conducted on the stream. Kick CEO had
donated 150 uh from the New York Times.
Quote, in live stream broadcast, viewers
would egg on the streamers as they
conducted acts of violence and physical
and moral humiliation on Mr. for graven.
So the literally the kick CEO was
watching this, enjoying it and donating.
Meanwhile, of course, when this
happened, everybody went like, &#34;Well,
where the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is the leadership of the
company? Why didn&#39;t they step in? Why
didn&#39;t they [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] ban this? How is
this allow allowed?&#34; Crystal told me
there was another scenario on some other
uh streaming site, I think it was, where
was it kick? I don&#39;t know. It may have
been kicked, but I don&#39;t know. where
some guy like left his his girlfriend or
his wife outside in the middle of the
winter in like Russia or some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and
she froze to death, right? And look, it
begs the question, and I&#39;m curious what
y&#39;all think of this, but I don&#39;t know.
Are we getting worse? Are we getting
more evil? Are are people just like,
have we collectively lost our [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
minds? Is there just mass psychosis and
mania overtaking the world at the same
time? or were we always this disgusting
and brutal and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] up, but it was
just like under wraps for a little bit
there, right? Because the thought of a
site like this existing and something
like this happening even just going
back, you know, whatever 12 years, 15
years, it&#39;s like, nah, you know, it used
to be things that were underground were
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] underground. You know what I&#39;m
saying? Like there there was that thing
when I was in like high school or
whatever called faces of death which is
like oh here&#39;s videos of people dying or
whatever and it was like oh if you watch
that oh that&#39;s crazy. Now it&#39;s like a
popular streaming site that has
celebrities who are like pretty big
internet celebrities.
They&#39;re hosting torture sessions where
somebody gets tortured to death. I mean
Aiden Ross is on kick. Mr. Beast made an
appearance on some kick show like the
week before this dude got tortured and
killed being live streamed on kick. Mr.
Beast, you know, the guy who all the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] like eight-year-olds watch,
right? What are we doing? So, are we
just getting more evil? And look, I have
to say this this has changed my mind
about something because I was always I
was I&#39;ve always been this massive free
speech bro. And I&#39;ve always been the guy
who says like, yeah, let everybody talk
and in the marketplace of ideas, the
better ideas will win out in the long
run. And you know, it&#39;s better to have
fewer rules about stuff like this. But
then you see this and you realize like,
oh wait, I was too optimistic about how
moral we are collectively and how
intelligent we are collectively. Like I
naively thought that yeah, there&#39;s
enough good people and enough morality
in the world where if you give people
freedom in space, nobody would set up a
show where they [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] torture somebody
to death in front of the in front of
hundreds or thousands of people. I
naively thought like of course if you&#39;re
given uh you know if you&#39;re gifted a
website that is a live streaming site
that is lenient with its terms of
service and its rules well obviously
nobody&#39;s going to take advantage of that
and end up doing the most disgusting
depraved [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you&#39;ve ever seen. But
that&#39;s literally exactly what happens.
It&#39;s a race to the bottom. If you don&#39;t
have rules, if you don&#39;t have
regulations, if you don&#39;t draw clear
moral lines, people will exploit that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] and they&#39;ll go lower and lower and
lower and lower in a sad attempt to try
to get more donations, right? And so, I
was wrong. I was flat out wrong. You
need rules. You need regulations. You
need the government to step in in a
scenario like this. I hope the
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] who tortured this poor
guy, I hope they end up locked up for
manslaughter. you know, is I don&#39;t think
they were actively trying to kill him,
but they ended up killing him, right?
Also, they definitely kidnapped him. He
wanted to leave. They didn&#39;t let him
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] leave, right? And then also, all
these sick, disgusting [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] who watched
it. How do you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sleep at night?
How does the kick CEO sleep allowing
this on his website? No problem
whatsoever. A man being tortured to
death. How do you sleep at night? The
fact if you enjoyed watching this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
do you know that you&#39;re a shitty person?
Do you know that you&#39;re bad? Do you know
that you&#39;re evil? Do you know that
you&#39;re demonic? Cuz you are. You are
that. And I&#39;m secular. I don&#39;t even
believe in God, but I believe in good
and evil. And what we see here is
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] evil. So, do you know that
that&#39;s what you are? If you&#39;re watching
this, that, hey, I shouldn&#39;t be enjoying
this. Why am I enjoying this? Does that
happen in your mind? Or are you such a
sick, depraved, disgusting [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that you
watch it and you&#39;re like, you love it
and you don&#39;t even think there&#39;s
anything wrong with liking it? Some poor
guy getting [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tortured to death.
Were you under the illusion that it
actually was consensual? that. Oh, Jean
just wanted to be tortured. Are you
really that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] stupid? There&#39;s no
way you&#39;re that stupid. Are you Are you
that dumb? So, I This throws me for a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] loop, man. And there&#39;s a lot of
people who should go to prison, but I
don&#39;t know. In the world we live in now,
I don&#39;t know. It seems like there&#39;s not
much accountability for much [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
right? And so, it&#39;s very possible nobody
ends up going down. It&#39;s very possible
uh kick is not going to update the rules
and regulations and not allow this kind
of stuff. But it makes me sick that this
is the kind of world that we live in now
that you know I&#39;ve been saying this a
lot and this is this happened in France
obviously but there really was some sort
of weird sea change. I I think during
the Trump era where it used to be the
case that if you were bad you at least
had to try to pretend to be good, right?
But in the Trump era everything was
flipped and reversed. So, it became a
virtue to be an [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] everything that
we were taught as kids like this makes
you a good person. Be honorable. Be true
to your word. Be kind. Be empathetic.
Like all of these things, they just they
threw it out and they said, &#34;No, it&#39;s
virtuous to be incredibly selfish and
greedy and narcissistic and going with
your gut instinct on everything is
better than doing research and learning
the nuances and the facts and adjusting
accordingly.&#34; this. So, like all the
values that we thought were the right
ones that are the right ones were
flipped and reversed in the Trump era
were now, you know, you&#39;re inauthentic
or you&#39;re a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] or you&#39;re a wonk or a
nerd or whatever if you abide by those
old school values. And here we are. This
is the result, right? This is the
result. Uh, and it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a
coincidence that at the same time [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like this is going on. We have
concentration camps being built in the
United States. You have people being
sent to SECOT, the concentration camp
Gulog in El Salvador. We have people uh
being sent to Guantanamo Bay. Trump want
to send 30,000 immigrants to Guantanamo
Bay. People being sent to Alligator
Awitz, even though that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] a judge
just said, &#34;Shut that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] down because
it&#39;s totally illegal.&#34; You have, you
know, we&#39;ll do a story either today or
tomorrow on Kilar Bgo Garcia and what
now what they&#39;re doing to him even after
after he was tortured even though he&#39;s a
totally innocent man. You have all that
going on. You have the bombings of all
these different countries. You have all
this going on. It&#39;s not a coincidence
it&#39;s happening at the same time as [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
like this. We&#39;ve lost our [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] minds
collectively. Nothing is held sacred.
People don&#39;t believe in good and evil
anymore, you know, and uh that&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s a dark world. That&#39;s a dark [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
world. So, in a world that made sense, a
lot of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] people would be going to
jail as a result of this. But um I don&#39;t
know if that&#39;s going to be the case. I
don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to be the
case. And that really is disturbing to
me. Hey y&#39;all, do me a favor and like
