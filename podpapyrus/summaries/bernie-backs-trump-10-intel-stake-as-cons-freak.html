Let&#39;s get to intel. This is a very
interesting story actually. Lots of uh
perhaps some left leftright horseshoe. A
lot of the right people are very upset
about it. So, let&#39;s go ahead and put it
up here on the screen. New uh
announcement made by Donald Trump. He
says, quote, &#34;It is my great honor to
report that the United States of America
now fully owns and controls 10% of
Intel, a great American company that has
even more incredible future. I
negotiated this deal with the highly
respected chief executive officer of the
company. The United States paid nothing
for these shares and the shares are now
valued at approximately 11 billion.
Great deal for America. Also a great
deal for Intel building leading edge
semiconductors and chips which is what
Intel does. Fundamental to the future of
our nation. Make America great again.
Thank you for your attention to this
matter. And so this has invited a lot of
very interesting discourse. Just to give
everybody some more details, we can put
the Wall Street Journal story up on the
screen which gives some of the uh some
of the details. Basically, what it does
is it converts Chips Act grants into
equity. So, they were going to get this
money anyways from the government. What
it does is converts to equity in the
company. And what it basically says is
it&#39;s going to be followed potentially by
other types of these deals. Under the
terms, the 8.9 million in grants that
had already been awarded to Intel from
2022 but had not yet been paid will just
be transferred to equity in the company
with basically a swap of that. They
won&#39;t even have any like voting, you
know, direct control in the overall
thing. they&#39;re paying some quote $2047 a
share which is actually a discount
apparently uh from what was recently
offered to the Japanese controlled soft
bank just so everybody aware but the
point is is that it&#39;s a bigger question
about government control and whether the
government should have a say in how
these type of companies operate and this
is a big like libertarian more like Koch
brothers traditional free market view
and what I would say is an industrial
policy view and it&#39;s actually important
for everybody to sit and to think about
the story of Intel. Intel was the
flagship American semiconductor
manufacturing company. It remains one of
the only major semiconductor
manufacturers in the United States today
who creates their own fabs. This is
another important thing. A lot of people
don&#39;t understand this. Nvidia and AMD,
two of the largest shares of market cap
chip companies, they don&#39;t make
anything. They design them and TSMC
makes all of it. Intel is the only one
that actually knows how to make it. Now,
why does that matter? Because if 90% of
advanced manufacturing for chips,
happens on the island of Taiwan, one of
the literally most geopolitically
unstable places in the world, that seems
to be like a little bit of a choke point
and uh maybe one where America has an
advantage in moving away from that.
That&#39;s why we&#39;re both supportive of the
chips act. Well, everybody needs to
understand this. If you leave it to the
free market or to American capitalism,
Intel is the story. You shut down the
fabs, become less competitive.
Meanwhile, Samsung, which is aka a
branch of the Korean government, TSMC,
aka a branch of the Taiwanese
government, SMIC, aka branch of the
Chinese government, are going to eat
your lunch because they don&#39;t care about
profit and loss statements on a
shareholder. They will subsidize the
out of the industry to roll it up
and to let Intel basically sacrifice
itself at on the altar of quote free
markets because it&#39;s easier to outsource
than it is to actually build
especially here in America. So then the
question is how do you accomplish that?
Now the grants themselves part of the
problem is that they&#39;re not stringent
enough in my opinion to make sure that
they do not continue a lot of this MBA
style process. So the question is how do
you actually compete if it&#39;s even
possible with TSMC with SMIC with
Samsung with all of these chip
manufacturers who build actual fabs? One
way is the current way with the chips
act where we&#39;re trying to get those
companies to build here in America. I
think I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything
necessarily wrong with that. But part of
the problem is is you still, you know,
it&#39;s not an American company. You&#39;re
still don&#39;t have nearly as much control
as you would for national security
purposes. The Taiwanese are Taiwan&#39;s
always going to be Taiwan first. Korea
is always going to be Korea first.
China, I mean, what you know, they&#39;re
the best at being China first. So,
shouldn&#39;t we have some sort of answer?
And so, before I get your uh take,
Crystal, we got to put out Senator
Bernie Sanders, the goat as always,
sticking to his principle. Let&#39;s put it
up here on the screen. Here&#39;s what he
had to say. If microchip companies make
a profit from the generous grants they
receive from the federal government, the
taxpayers of America have a right to a
reasonable return on that investment.
And so, not only do I endorse that, but
I actually would say that if anything,
we should have more of control with
Intel here. Yes, I know, crony
capitalism, whatever. All right, let me,
you know, again, spell it out for you.
There is no critical national security
interest which should not be under the
control of a government. It would
actually be irresponsible to do so
because if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re going
to end up like America today, which is
basically a hollowedout husk of people
who design and then let the
Chinese, the Taiwanese, the Koreans, the
Japanese actually build all of it for
us. God help us if we&#39;re ever actually
in in a bad situation. That&#39;s my overall
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um Bernie&#39;s principle 100% agree with.
Unfortunately, I just know that Trump is
going to use this to do some like stupid
corrupt Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gold chip. Well, the first gold chip
ever manufactured.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, not only that, like I think it&#39;s
also important for people to really sit
with these chips are incredibly
important. They genuinely are, which is
part of the case for why we should have
a direct interest and yes, I I think
Bernie&#39;s principle is totally true that
if we are giving these companies all
these subsidies, and Bernie, I think
actually opposed the chips and science
act or had some issues with it because
if of all the, you know, the taxpayer
subsidies. So, I think it&#39;s reasonable
to say yes, the American people should
benefit from profits. However, becau
this is such a critical industry. We&#39;re
talking about for defense, we&#39;re talking
about for aerospace, we&#39;re talking about
for EVs, for like the industries of the
future, renewable energy. So critical.
You could just see the way Trump would
use this way to, you know, punish his
political opponents, to reward his
cronies, all of those sorts of things.
And so that&#39;s why it&#39;s like, well, we&#39;ll
see. I mean, it&#39;s kind of like with the
tariffs, right? In general, do I support
some, you know, protectionist policy in
key industries? Sure. Does this man
execute that in any sort of like a
reasonable way in the American interest?
No. He executes all his policies in his
own interest. It&#39;s all about him having
him personally having more power, money,
influence, control. And so that&#39;s why I
can&#39;t totally be like, let&#39;s go with
this. Have some of the some of the same
reservation,
right? Like I said, all they got to do
is build a gold chip and give it to them
and be like, &#34;Oh, okay, cool. I&#39;m good.&#34;
You know, I don&#39;t need to make anything
else here. But I still think it&#39;s worth
fighting because all of Wall Street and
all these other people are up in arms.
They prefer the Nvidia AMD model, which
is pay for play. And I I think that&#39;s
ridiculous, which is basically grants
Nvidia and AMD as long as they pay their
10% to the US government, they get to do
business in China. No, we decide whether
you do business in China or or not. And
again, the question is this is the value
problem and the American problem in a
nutshell. Have you ever noticed every
time you buy a laptop and you open it
up, what does the word say? It says
designed by Apple in California.
Designed by Apple in California,
manufactured in Guangha, Shang, you
know, whatever. Uh, same thing with all
these chips. The reason Nvidia and and
AMD are so massively profitable is
because they take the service sector
part of our economy, which we&#39;re great
at, right? We have all the world&#39;s
talent and we design all this stuff, but
Taiwan makes it. Over 80% of Nvidia
chips manufactured in Taiwan. Over I
think it&#39;s 90% of AMD manufactured at
TSMC. The actual nitty-gritty of the
manufacturing, we don&#39;t do it. Why?
Super expensive. If you look at the
history, there&#39;s a acquired podcast. If
anybody wants to go and listen, I highly
recommend on the history of TSMC. 48% of
initial startup capital for TSMC
Taiwanese government. People don&#39;t
understand this is not an industry which
you can compete by the quote free
market. It will not happen. You will get
crushed by state capitalism. And in
fact, this is again I would ask all
these conservatives and all that. Let&#39;s
look at the model because their claim is
state capitalism can&#39;t work. Really? BYD
doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s news to the largest
one of the most profitable car companies
in the world. Uh BYD doesn&#39;t work. SMIC
isn&#39;t a juggernaut in terms of chip
manufacturing. Look at their battery
manufacturer. Look at their airplane
manufacturer. All their high-tech
manufacturer. None of it makes any
actual profit. All of it is subsidized
by the government. And all of it is,
frankly, creating in many cases much
better products than so-called free
market capitalism here in America. This
isn&#39;t to say a whole endorsement of the
Chinese model, but you cannot sit with a
straight face and say it doesn&#39;t work.
It obviously works. I mean, the number
of people that China has lifted out of
poverty is genuinely an economic miracle
is genuinely an economic miracle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, do we think that Trump with
Howard Lutnik and these people are going
to be have the long-term interests of
America in mind and even have the cap
even if they did have the capability to
like plan strategically and execute on a
you know a whole industrial policy? Of
course not. And so on the one hand,
look, I hope that there are some, you
know, bold Democrat out there somewhere
who&#39;s looking at all of this and can,
okay, well, they sort of laid down the
marker here. We can take this model and
we can expand and we can actually do it
in the American interest. I hope that
maybe that exists. Am I confident about
that? No. In the meantime, like we know
this is going to be less of the China
model and more of the Russia model of
like, you know, let me use the state
control to like reward my cronies and
lock in this, you know, group of
oligarchs who surround me and bring me
gold bars in the Oval Office or whatever
and pad my own bottom line and use it in
order to make sure I can punish the
opposition. And if Gavin Newsome wants
to do renewable energy projects in the
state of California, I&#39;m going to make
sure he can&#39;t get the chips that he
needs to be able to succeed in his
project, etc. Like that&#39;s more like much
more likely to be the direction that we
go in with this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, let me give a defense of the
Russian model is uh whenever the
sanctions hit, what happened? Their GDP
grew. They actually survived because the
Russian model, if correctly executed, is
yes, we will be massively corrupt and
give it out to our oligarch friends, but
at the very least, it&#39;s all here because
we&#39;re the worst of all worlds. We&#39;re
oligarchic and we&#39;ve outsourced
everything. So we have a Russian style
pay-for-pplace system without any of the
domestic manufacturing, domestic
capabilities. And watching people freak
out about this, you know, about
socialism and the scary word and all of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is funny to see like people who
freaked out about Zoron&#39;s five grocery
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Totally right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Then turn around and be like, &#34;Oh, this
is fine.&#34; You know?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So here&#39;s a good taste uh of some
of it, shall we? This is from C5, Eric
Ericson, one of the classic, you know,
never Trump style original
conservatives. Here&#39;s what he had to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s no national security
justification for this. In fact, I had
some anonymous account on Twitter say,
&#34;Yeah, there&#39;s a national security
justification for having control of of
Intel.&#34; Really? We don&#39;t have control of
Rathon. We don&#39;t have government control
of Nvidia. We don&#39;t have government
control of Apple. We don&#39;t have
government control of Boeing. We don&#39;t
have government control of Loheed
Martin. We don&#39;t have government control
of any major weapons developer or
defense contractor, but you want 10%
control of intel in exchange for money
the government already promised to give
them. That&#39;s socialism. You may be
comfortable with socialism. You may
decide you like socialism because
someone from the Trump administration
wants socialism, but my god, people,
what have we been fighting for for the
last decade? You want smaller
government, this expands it. You want
the the government not to go woke. Well,
what happens when the Democrats get in
charge and they become the largest
shareholder of Intel? Good luck stopping
that from happening. You know, there&#39;s
no such thing as permanence in politics
in the United States of America. You&#39;re
not going to stop a Democrat from one
day winning re-election or getting into
the White House. Having the government
take control of a private corporation in
exchange for government funding. First
of all, they shouldn&#39;t even get
government funding. You should let Intel
fall flat on its face for having a bad
business decision and let the creative
destruction of the marketplace pick them
apart. Let other companies buy up their
pieces or let them regroup. A government
bailout. You know what this does is it
causes a distortion in the marketplace.
Something called a moral hazard where
more and more companies realize they can
take extraordinary risks and fall flat.
Irresponsible risks, not extraordinary
risks, irresponsible risks. And the
government will just say, &#34;Well, give me
10% of your company and I&#39;ll make you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That would be national suicide. That&#39;s
literally a case for national suicide is
we should let it&#39;s like the auto
companies. Don&#39;t bail them out. Let them
fail. Okay. Yeah. Great. That&#39;ll be
awesome. For the people of Detroit for
any sort of manufacturing during World
War II, the US took control of a
literally the war production board set
the actual amounts that every company in
the America had to produce. At many
times they would come in, seize the
mines, seize the actual factory floor.
No strikes, none of this This
is the amount that we&#39;re pumping out
today because we have actual national
security concern. The idea there&#39;s no
national security concern again on chips
is preposterous. We are in the opposite
where we it is one of the most glaring
problems that we face as a country. It&#39;s
like a slowmoving crisis. every single
day that we move forward and we come to
some sort of quote solution as the
Chinese like to call it to the Taiwanese
question, we are so screwed. We
literally as a country, we would have to
turn our laptops in. We probably have to
stop broadcasting. We have to turn all
these uh computers in because the
government would need to rip the chips
out of them for missile production or
any of that. People do not understand
how vulnerable we are. Fabs and all that
takes 5 10 years to come online. It is
so difficult, massively capital
intensive. Again, the only reason the
Taiwanese are where they are is because
they subsidized the hell out of it
because they knew that we were so dumb
that we would let our companies fail.
And the best part is Morris Chang. Where
do you think he learned everything that
he got? Here from Texas Instruments. He
came to America. He learned our learned
our system and he&#39;s like, &#34;Yeah, these
guys are idiots.&#34; Went back to China.
Went back to Taiwan.
Game over. Killed us. Same with, you
know, I mean, with the Koreans and more.
So anyway, look, I understand your
concern, but the benefit actually is,
sure, three and a half years of Trump,
it&#39;s probably going to be dumb. All
right, let&#39;s all be honest, but it&#39;s
staying and that&#39;s a good thing. I think
it&#39;s a good thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We&#39;ll see how it all pans out. I I will
say at least Ericson is consistent. You
know, the number of Republicans who, you
know, panic over the five grocery stores
and then they have nothing to say about
this is pretty funny to me, pretty
entertaining. Nobody actually believes
that for it national security industry
that you should leave it to the free
market or creative destruction. That&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; some people do that. I mean this has
been like but you know a lot of people
do in this town because that&#39;s been the
de facto policy for years is like let&#39;s
let all of the you know pharmaceuticals
go overseas. Let&#39;s let you know also any
sort of critical production. let&#39;s not
have any sort of a national strategy or
you know and and let&#39;s not care
certainly at all about the way that
we&#39;re destroying the lives of the uh
working middle class in this country. I
mean that has been the policy what Eric
Ericson is describing that continues by
and large to be the policy of America.
And that&#39;s the issue, right? I thought
that we all fought against that. I
thought that we I mean, if you look at a
poll or whatever, they would be like,
&#34;It&#39;s preposterous the idea that you
should not have a chip manufacturing or
frankly pharmaceutical manufacturing,
oil refineries, nuclear reactors,
anything that sustains something like we
are so we are so outdated and
increasingly embracing national
suicide.&#34; And it&#39;s like watching it all
happen every day is disgusting. I just
recently was talking with someone about
um the old this just the old model of
America in World War II which a lot of
people want to look at and venerate as a
production the com the country the B7
Boeing and who we are. One of the
benefits that we had as America was we
were a country that was able to turn out
all of this weaponry and these tanks. We
did it with machines and with a
population and a troop force which knew
how to do that for mobilize. And what we
were fighting were the Germans and the
Japanese who were people who didn&#39;t have
mass production but had highly
specialized like art almost artistic
types of manufacturer where for the
Japanese zero or for the very first jet
engine that the Germans were ever able
to create. We&#39;re the Germans now. We&#39;re
the Japanese. We have these crazy
expensive B2 bombers and all this stuff.
Do we have the fuel to fly them? Do we
have all of the bombs or the uh
ammunition or the chips to actually put
into them? No. We&#39;re the Germans now.
And that putting it in that terms has is
really important for people to
understand. Like we have moved away from
that mass production economy economy to
this highly specialized one that
actually in a crisis would never be able
to function. And that&#39;s really honestly
it&#39;s scary. Like Russia today is a much
better model for a country who&#39;s able to
survive as a result of a crisis. And so
anyway, this puts us hopefully I think
on a better direction.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, if if it all ends with, you know,
a Democrat coming in and nationalizing
pharma, I will retrospectively say yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, look, what Dem what Dem would be
dumb enough not to at least say that on
the campaign trail? Seriously, all of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Huh? You really think so? At this point,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, maybe I don&#39;t know. Name one
that would be like nationalized pharma.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Somebody&#39;s got to say or somebody&#39;s got
to say something about it. I mean,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe we&#39;re so
captive. Do you think Gavin Newsome is
going to say nationalized pharma?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s that many
Gresian Whitmer. Uh these people are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wonder where they I need to look into
it for where their manufacturer bases
are because I mean most of them are
European anyways. Screw them. All right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there&#39;s a lot I think in New England.
