Boom. You could vape inside.
Sometimes I just need to have the action
of like
something blowing out my mouth, I guess.
Are we addicted?
We&#39;re just addicts basically. Just a
bunch of addicts.
Yeah. How&#39;s everyone feeling?
Good. I mean, Payeyton pissed me off
this morning, but it worked out.
What did I do?
Okay, so we get to her house. No. Okay.
we get to her house and my phone was
blowing her phone up. We&#39;re just outside
and there&#39;s, you know, a homeless person
right there and he was just staring at
us and I&#39;m like pissed off cuz like why
are you not answering the phone? You
how long were you waiting?
Like 5 minutes.
No, it was 10 minutes. I looked at the
and you know what else I told Kayla? I
said she going to come down here and be
super dry and be like, &#34;Sorry, guys.&#34;
And that&#39;s exactly what you did.
What am I supposed to do? Oh my god. I&#39;m
so sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. Forgive me. No,
it was the, &#34;Hey, I got to walk.
I got to walk Baka.&#34; And it just walks
past us.
What made it worse is that you proved
exactly what she was going to say. You
I&#39;m just a dry person. Like Baka was I
am a dry person. Like I&#39;d definitely be
Thank God somebody was coming out
because that&#39;s how we got in. Wasn&#39;t
because of you.
But we&#39;re here now and I feel good now
Did that ruin like your whole morning?
It ruined my morning for a little 10
minutes. Yes, it did. But it don&#39;t
predict my day.

Okay. Yeah,
that would be that would Hey,
that&#39;d be crazy, huh? My next biggest
thing that I&#39;m taking care of right now
is Peyton&#39;s trip. Just know I&#39;m excited.
I&#39;m about to be in the waters.
Yeah, but y&#39;all need to watch that Amy
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like fear.
Watch it. Okay.
I don&#39;t believe in fear.
Go on the boat.
I just seen today. So sad.
The Amy Brley.
No. This lady had a heart attack on a
cruise and since her husband did not
have $15,000 for the air air helicopter
to airlift her to a hospital, she died.
That&#39;s sad. So, make sure you have
travel insurance. That&#39;s what I&#39;m going
to pay for today
before I go anywhere.
There&#39;s traveling insurance.
You should have life insurance in
I don&#39;t think I think that&#39;s two
different things.
She had she had insurance, but the
insurance is not taken everywhere. So,
Oh, yeah. Cuz usually your insurance is
just in the state that you live in.
You need $15,000 or travel insurance and
they didn&#39;t have neither.
And she had another cardiac arrest.
you know they have like a they have like
cruise jail and then they have like a
cruise hospital.
Yeah, but that&#39;s not nothing. After
watching Amy Bradley.
Oh my god.
What happened to her?
She went missing on the cruise.
She was found.
No, they never found her. She&#39;s
somewhere in Carousel Barbados.
Stop fair.
They&#39;re talking about she was
trafficked. Oh,
they took her off of the boat. A worker.
How did you traffic through a cruise?
they ain&#39;t taking none of us off the
I don&#39;t know.
Fearongering.
We almost got kidnapped in Jamaica.
What were you doing?
I mean, I didn&#39;t mean to say.
What are you doing to get kidnapped in
That&#39;s another story for another day.
Jamaica was a long
It&#39;s a lot been going on in LA. Like the
freaking dude that plowed into the 30
people. Oh my god, that was so
And then they said they said that he got
pulled out of the car and shot and beat
and beat up. I said
they beat him up after he was shot.
No, they shot I think they shot him and
then beat pulled him out the car and
beat him up. I was like, dang.
Why is that funny?
Well, it is funny cuz he plowed over 50
50 people but 30 people got injured.
That&#39;s crazy.
Did anybody No, nobody got mad. I mean,
nobody died, but he he got mad because
he got kicked out the club. So he came
around and started running them over cuz
they kicked him out the club.
Excuse me.
Oh, he deserved to get shot and beat up.
So that&#39;s why that that&#39;s how
that&#39;s just crazy though. Like
And then the girl RIP another girl just
died recently I think in honor
from from what?
At a sports bar over a um a was No,
that&#39;s not over.
They were supposed to be meeting
fight or what?
I just heard it was an altercation from
the news.
Somebody was trying to fight.
Yeah. And then instead of um fighting
the other girl uh
shot her.
Oh wow.
That sounds like some GTA I mean stuff.
Hawthorne somewhere.
This girl I saw I was like let me not
talk about that cuz you know I know
somebody that know her.
I know somebody know her too. So rest in
peace to her and you know sending love
to all her family.
That is so sad.
The world is crazy. But
let&#39;s talk about some love.
Is it love?
No. I said let&#39;s talk about some love.
Let&#39;s bring this topic up. what we&#39;re
talking about today, you guys. What&#39;s
hot right now? Well, it&#39;s over, but it
it&#39;s hot. Love Island.
It caused such a chaotic season. Like,
the last couple months have been just
and I&#39;m glad that it came to an end. But
I was really consumed by that show.
Everybody started saying like, um, I&#39;m
glad Love Island is over. I feel like I
got my life back.
No, for real. But now I&#39;ll be bored.
No, not with Nick. Not with Nick and all
his lives
Snapchats. No, you could see so many
on Tik Tok. Yeah.
Why did Tik Tok Why does Tik Tok have a
thing now where you can subscribe to
watch like exclusive videos?
Oh, really?
Yes. I did not know that. I was trying
to watch a video on his channel and it
said I had to just subscribe.
that&#39;s smart.
That is really smart though.
Extra money
cuz people are tuned in to their stuff
right now. So, he&#39;s making they&#39;re all
making That&#39;s why you need to go
That&#39;s why you need to go on their pay.
You know how many how much brand deals
these people are getting now that
they&#39;re out of the um villa.
Okay, look. Listen.
When do they go back to work?
On Friday, I met Sinko.
Sinko from Love Island season 3.
Oh, he was at age single.
He was at Sco.
And I told him I was talking to him
about the podcast. I said, &#34;I would
really love to get you on our podcast.&#34;
And he followed me. He was like, &#34;Tap
down.&#34; Say, &#34;Remember my name cuz I&#39;m
going to message you. And if you are
happen to watching this now, I&#39;m going
to message you and we need to have him
on the podcast.
Yeah, I would love to know about like
the ins and outs of the
And he was on the challenge.
Yeah, he was.
Who watches that? Tell her. Is that
Yeah, that&#39;s him.
Tell her the challenge is big.
I don&#39;t even know what that is. Like is
that like a fear factor type show?
Show. But
not to the extent of fear factor, but
like that like a survival type of show.
Challenges earn money. And I think he&#39;d
be such a good guest. not only a male
guest, but just having someone from
reality TV and like we can start asking
questions for you because I I think you
should go on there and what to expect.
Like do you think you could go two
months without a phone? No contact.
Two months.
No IRL, no Twitch, no nothing
and no liquor, no weed. Y&#39;all would
probably die.
was acting like that.
Think about how much like everything is
just paying
all the money you&#39;ll get off that like
everything will take off.
You don&#39;t have to even do Twitch no
You&#39;re the guest on people&#39;s Twitch and
like I don&#39;t know like
now they&#39;re all twitching.
They want you on their stuff.
Kais wants you on his show,
K have no on there. I mean, no females
on there. He had Jeremiah.
He had Jeremiah from Love Island on his
That&#39;s because he was a fan before he
went on Love Island.
Why Jeremiah?
He was a fan. They It came out that he
was watching one of somebody in AMP&#39;s
like live streams before and they pulled
up his chat logs.
So, I think that&#39;s why they ended up
asking him to come on the stream. I
think it was Chris next door or
one. It&#39;s somebody from AMP.
It was Davis.
Davis. Yeah.
Wow. I think that&#39;s why that happened.
With Love Island being the talk of the
town, why do y&#39;all think this season
made such an impact in society or just
within our social climate?
I think because of season six. Season 6
made such a big impact that I feel like
season 7 was everybody was tuning in
like, okay,
is it going to be better than season six
when season 6 still holds their crown.
This season did not do that. They didn&#39;t
take that from them. And yeah, I
realized a lot of the new watchers
didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t watch season six and
how like
like legendary that season was and how
they really like walk so this season
could run.
But I feel like the new watchers really
ruined it for us though. Like it&#39;s not
the same. There&#39;s no movie nights.
There&#39;s a lot of things cut out. Like
I feel like the audience is also too
much involved this time. Like you know,
especially with all like things.
Keep the votes to a minimum. Like
Yeah. I mean, I&#39;m not mad at the how the
voting went. I just feel like people had
such a say in how this season went that
they were able to get people off just by
doing their own research. You know what
I&#39;m saying? Like,
so I just feel like yeah, the the
society or like, you know, the people,
we really had a big hand in this season
versus like the last season. It&#39;s just
you vote and that&#39;s what it is.
Yeah. I&#39;m a new viewer. I&#39;m a new
watcher. I didn&#39;t watch last season, but
I kept seeing how everybody was just
talking so highly about it. So, I was
like, &#34;Let me see what the hype is.&#34;
Like, &#34;Let me see what got y&#39;all in the
Choco.&#34; But I see the hype. I do. You
never watched it at all.
And they have UK, Spain, USA. Like,
I&#39;ve heard.
And I feel like I watched it.
Yeah. It&#39;s everywhere.
Like, it&#39;s literally everywhere. Like, I
know all I know everybody that was
there. I know when somebody got
eliminated, when somebody can&#39;t Kasa
Villa, Kasamore, all this. Like, okay. I
feel like I&#39;m watching the show. Like
I wish I would have known you would have
went to the the finale. We would have
invited you.
I didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t I didn&#39;t go like for
the finale. I just went out.
Why you go watch a finale somewhere? You
I didn&#39;t watch the finale anywhere. I
just went out.
So when everybody when it was on the big
screen TV,
I wasn&#39;t like by time I went out.
Oh, you wasn&#39;t at a party.
It&#39;s already done.
Oh, so you didn&#39;t go to a watch party?
That&#39;s why I&#39;m I&#39;m telling you I didn&#39;t.
I just went out that day.
Oh, okay. And I guess it was a watch
party before cuz I went to third base.
Oh yeah, they had they had something
But I went after like
Oh yeah, you went after.
How y&#39;all feel about having Isaiah on
here? He said he would do it.
Yeah, he would be a good he would be a
good guest
and he&#39;s been on he&#39;s been a host for
Now TV. Like how did you get into all
this? See, I really like think
because he&#39;s very consistent with the
videos that he posts.
Very even it&#39;s not even about the
consistency though. He gives good takes
like I&#39;ll be interested in what you have
to say.
I love his recaps when he recap all the
shows cuz I be relating. I&#39;ll be like,
&#34;Okay, you caught that too cuz
they be doing weird stuff and he be
watching everything like he not just
like certain shows like
I think he just recently signed with
like some company or something like that
like reviewing their shows and stuff
which is
good. Yeah, they have people for that.
They have a job for that.
I mean what he does like going viral
like that. Yeah. I would watch our show
too. It was something with like Peacock.
Yeah, peacock.
I saw that he he had did a review on
side note. He did a review on baddies
gone wild and the girl T made a video
back to him and it&#39;s like girl don&#39;t go
don&#39;t come Friday yet cuz he got a whole
community that come for him that come
for you.
What did she say?
He just didn&#39;t like what he had to say.
I don&#39;t know verbatim. I can&#39;t even say
but I did see like the little T. Just
don&#39;t even remember.
That&#39;s why he&#39;s the reviewer and not me
cuz you got to remember what what you
saw. Um, so I do have like an extra
question that I kind of wanted to ask.
Um, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s too soon to
bring this up, but I should I
Yeah, go.
So, I wanted to know like y&#39;all thoughts
on um
tell a little backstory like if Hood
went too far on in the heart race
challenge.
You already saw that.
You saw those clips.
Do you think she went too far?
I don&#39;t know.
Because in her in her com
everybody&#39;s like they don&#39;t know what
she did. They don&#39;t know what she did.
But then everybody was also saying like,
&#34;Yeah, she did too much.&#34; Like,
because in the Call Me Daddy interview,
she&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, that I just literally
turned around and did a little onetwo
twerk and got up.&#34; Like, but then
everybody else is like,
&#34;No, you didn&#39;t.
No, you didn&#39;t.&#34;
She has some stripper moves at her.
She has to be a stripper in her past
life, but she did say in her interview
that she always was a dancer.
She says you&#39;re a dancer and then she
does sing. So,
she was getting it. I seen it. I was
like, &#34;Oh,
okay.&#34; But the tea was is that the
people found out that Ace had already
been liking her photos before they went
Yeah, I saw that.
So it&#39;s like
she said that though her own mouth.
Yeah, she did say that. So my thing is
though like do you think like Ace
he knew Shelly when Shelley walked in
and he he knew of Huda when she walked
in. Do you think he had his eye on like
Hooda and it&#39;s just like that&#39;s just not
how the cards played out? Because I feel
like there was some underlying like like
chemistry between them that they just
didn&#39;t speak on.
I don&#39;t think they had any well from
what we saw the clips we saw it wasn&#39;t
like given like they were putting each
other for chats like they had chemistry
it wasn&#39;t given that but the way Ace was
so determined
with her relationship with Jeremiah
that&#39;s when I first you know when we all
first started watching
determined like how
determined to break up their couple
like he just really like was not for
their couple like he was saying they
faking it like all kind of stuff you
know and it&#39;s just Like how are they
faking it when they kind of just like
you know
they were kind of like the only couple
that was like super loveydovey like so
close. It was like a week or two in
it was a day or two
girl. Yeah, it was crazy.
The point of Love Island is making
connections.
But the point of Love Island is to make
a connection. So that&#39;s when in the
beginning I was like I don&#39;t blame
why y&#39;all fought her for getting a
connection.
I was like I don&#39;t in the beginning I
was like I don&#39;t blame her. Like she&#39;s
doing what she came there for. She just
so happened to find her person soon but
then everything did not play out.
Some people actually sparked though.
Like it&#39;s not uncom in Love Island
history. It&#39;s not uncommon to spark on
the first day and you all actually make
it through though.
It&#39;s whether Ace was already interested
in Huda. I feel like he was already
interested in Huda in some way and he
was just like Shelly wasn&#39;t already on
him like that. You know, she was coupled
up with Austin for a minute. So she he&#39;s
probably like I don&#39;t know. Do I got
Shelly? Do I not? And then Hooda like I
feel like he&#39;s just interested in her
but Jeremiah&#39;s in a way. And then plus
those boys all followed him. So he just
had a little alliance and they voted him
off. But I was actually very shocked
when he did leave
when Asa
when Jeremiah left. Did you see his
face? He was like
oh Jeremiah. Yeah.
He was like
he said I was
wait how does the voting work?
Is it the people or is it
depends? It depends. You never really
They could let us vote one night like
America vote or it could just be like up
to the islanders
like so. So the producers are messy.
In Jeremiah&#39;s case, it was up to the
finishing of the voting was up to the
Islanders and they voted him off and he
had the strongest connection at the time
which didn&#39;t make sense.
But he wasn&#39;t with Huda. He was with
at that time
when he eliminated.
Oh, and that&#39;s when they was saying
he&#39;s love bombing Andrina. He&#39;s doing
the same exact things that he was doing
to Huda. And Hood went on the interview
and said he was doing literally
everything to Andrina to the tea that he
was doing to me.
Oh. a grown man.
I really don&#39;t believe her.
I don&#39;t believe that.
Why are they worried about what he&#39;s
She&#39;s literally
as a Yeah, y&#39;all as a grown men, other
islanders, why are y&#39;all worried about
like what connections he&#39;s making or
what he&#39;s doing
or how they&#39;re playing the game?
I think they&#39;re mad that he&#39;s getting
the cutest
I think that&#39;s what it was.
That was rumored that it was jealousy
that you know
all the girls saying was the baddest.
No. So Landria is queen and Shelly
Hood is
Shelly is so pretty to me.
Shel says that that Huda was like really
Hooda is really pretty and so was
Andrina really pretty and both
Jeremiah&#39;s type you know he he was
lucking up back to back like even though
him and Hood connection fell it was like
dang like right after oh but I got
Andrina like we can just go. So I feel
like they didn&#39;t like that. And mind
you, at the time their pickings was slim
because the girls was exploring. Like
Shel, she was talking to uh Austin
before she even went to Casa. Like their
pickings was still exploring. So I feel
like that was making her mad.
what is Casa?
Where a bunch of other You want to
explain it better?
No, go ahead. Well, me as a new viewer,
I think it&#39;s where a bunch of they go to
like another little island and there&#39;s
uh new girls and new guys that go for
the OGs basically and you see if you
have a a real connection with them.
That&#39;s how I would like perceive that I
I would just say they&#39;re testing their
connection.
Testing your connection and it&#39;s time
where you guys all go back to the villa.
Now it&#39;s either you going to choose your
original connection or your new
connection
and that&#39;s where it just gets tricky.
Yeah, it&#39;s messy. It&#39;s to test the
relationship you have that you already
made in the villa. But yeah, so you
basically go to the house where there&#39;s
a bunch of new bombshells at one time
and you see if you have any connections
or if you interested in somebody else.
Most people just be like, you know, like
bored at Kasa because they&#39;re so into
who they have back at the original house
at the villa.
And most people take Kasa as an
opportunity to like, yeah, let me
explore all I can, you know? And some
people really end up with different
couples from Kasa. And yeah, that&#39;s how
Kasa Amore and Kasa boys get into the
Do y&#39;all think I would be like a good OG
or a good bombshell?
I feel a good question.
I don&#39;t know. Payton,
I think you should be a bombshell.
I think you would be a bombshell.
As a OG, Payeyton, I don&#39;t know. I feel
like you&#39;re going to get like the
Sierra treatment. They&#39;re going to what?
They&#39;re going to investigate your social
medias and say on what she said.
If I got on there, I would delete my
Yeah, bro.
But I think they will probably still be
able to pull up some old tweets.
Ever since the whole Sierra and and
Ulysa situation, I went on my Twitter
and just typed in certain words. Like,
have I dumbly mistakenly said,
&#34;Oh, yeah. I&#39;ve definitely done that.&#34;
And I was like, &#34;Let me delete all this
I be saying crazy stuff on Twitter.
all the arguments I&#39;ll be getting in. Oh
my god. Like they&#39;re going to all love
you and then they&#39;re going to find a
reason to hate you.
Bro, and I don&#39;t that&#39;s what I would be
scared of. Like I&#39;m scared of like them
going through all my social media and
just judging me. And I feel like they
they pick at everybody. Like they pick
at Huda, they pick at Shelly, they pick
at Ace, they pick at like literally
everybody on there, they get
scrutinized. Like yes, it&#39;s a lot of
support, but then there&#39;s always like a
lot of hate, too. And I&#39;m so scared of
that because I feel like I&#39;ve said a lot
and I&#39;ve done a lot.
Agreed to go on reality TV. It&#39;s It&#39;s
No, it&#39;s turning back. Yeah.
Yeah. I feel like some people like
although Huda is getting a lot of
backlash and same as Sierra before all
this was found out she had a good
community like backing her up like and
so Hood she getting a lot of backlash
but she has this huge
fan base that&#39;s just take like she&#39;s
lying in 4K
and they&#39;re just still Hood baby like
Hood headquarters
good rats rats
well no that&#39;s what Sierra thought they
were and they was like that&#39;s not her
fan base name Oh, what are they called?
I don&#39;t know. I just know it&#39;s hood
headquarters,
but like it&#39;s always going to be people
that hate you, people that love you.
do you hate you?
It&#39;s nothing like it&#39;s nothing. I mean,
it&#39;s just going to be intensified.
But shoot, the PR work we would have to
do behind the scenes while you&#39;re in
I&#39;m telling you, I would literally
delete my Twitter. Like,
but we would we would have it together.
Don&#39;t worry.
We will have your back. Like, you have a
hand every [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] in if I have to.
Well, we can&#39;t do that. We have to still
keep her, you know, good brand deals.
No, y&#39;all can. I could be that one
friend and I will.
They going to be like, &#34;Get this [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
out of here.&#34;
They going to be like A&#39;s best friend
that went up on [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Oh my god. Like,
she&#39;s so mean.
She was talking about dead homies.
Oh my gosh. And we don&#39;t know about
that. Like
dead homies.
Dead homies. And my thing is, you know,
y&#39;all know how Love Island is so like
chopped and screwed up, but you know how
we get like we&#39;re watching a current
episode and then okay, another episode
is coming out tomorrow. I literally be
like after that first episode, I could
be like, &#34;Dang, I feel I&#39;m going just
say Ace for example. Dang, I feel
different about Ace. He was acting a
little weird.&#34; And then next thing you
know, the next episode comes out with
the full clips and stuff and now it&#39;s
like, &#34;Oh, he was right.&#34; Validated. And
I feel like after each episode, people
go state their opinions so quickly and
so fast without even
let it watch it a little before you give
such a strong opinion and come for
somebody like that on the internet.
Where is straight like you know I feel
like I feel like she should have just
held back and watched a little more cuz
her accusing Shelly all that and
who wait what
saying she just went
uh Ace Ace&#39;s best friend I believe.
Yeah. She just went online talking
really bad about Shelly like and it was
saying Shel really didn&#39;t like him and
stuff like that and now it&#39;s very
awkward now that they&#39;re out. They&#39;re a
They&#39;re so cute.
And you&#39;re you&#39;re so cute. You&#39;re
supposed to be his best friend. I bet
you that&#39;s weird.
She probably apologized.
She apologized uh on a Tik Tok video,
turned off her comments. I seen her
apology video, but this is like
people just move too fast.
That&#39;s in general.
I feel like she should have let the
season die down and then gave her
recaps. Like I mean not let the season
die down but watch that next episode cuz
literally by that next episode her
apology video was out. She was like I&#39;m
sorry I ap
I want to ask cuz I don&#39;t see none of
our topics like so how do we really feel
about Nicoa?
Oh yeah I was for them.
You was?
Why was?
Well I was really for Okay. I don&#39;t know
because I was just like I just felt like
and this just goes into my question cuz
I was going to bring up the Taylor and
Alandria situation.
Okay. And I just feel like Taylor just I
didn&#39;t like how he did her. And if you
didn&#39;t like her, then you could have
just kind of said that from the jump,
you know? Like I feel like you kind of
let her on to stay on the show and you
waited for a like a kasa a more girl.
Not even a more. You waited for somebody
to come in so that you was interested in
and took that long. Yeah. You know,
that&#39;s why I&#39;m like, okay, I just feel
like kind of like just deserves better
in the show. And when Nick just came
around, he just kind of gave her like a
different experience. I felt like just
stuff Taylor was not doing at all.
He didn&#39;t like her.
Nick&#39;s doing stuff some Nick is doing
stuff that a man does when he&#39;s
interested in you. Yeah.
Literally.
And but it&#39;s but it&#39;s weird. Like I just
feel like Taylor wasn&#39;t attracted to her
at all in no type of way because as soon
as Coco came up in here, you you put in
your last name after her first name.
Like it was just weird. So if you wasn&#39;t
physically attracted to her like you
said to Ace, you should have left her
Okay. But you said
he probably but it&#39;s like the point of
the g isn&#39;t the point of it to win, you
know? Like he was probably just playing
a game so he could stay on there longer.
That&#39;s exactly what he was doing but
with the wrong intentions. And I feel
like that&#39;s why
Taylor has the hate that he has now
for leading her on cuz you could you
could definitely stay up in the house
like literally he could have explained
to her like you know I don&#39;t think we
should explore no more. She could have
went on about her business. M
she had multiple opportunities to talk
to other people, but she was still so
stuck on Taylor Taylor because she
thinks there&#39;s a connection. She&#39;s like
It was her even customer. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m
going to get I&#39;m going to get back to my
cowboy. No, you&#39;re not.
It became like he already had a new and
he already he found another connection.
The new girl that he&#39;s with.
What did she do?
Okay. Wait. How about this? When she
went home,
they saved the two people that went home
and they went back to the original
villa. So when they woke up, it&#39;s
Alandria and Nick in a bed and she&#39;s
watching Clark. I mean, she&#39;s watching
Taylor make this new connection with the
new Kasa girl, Clark.
Wait, so they show them?
Yes. They went home.
They live together.
They ended up after they left Kasa
Moore, they all ended up back at the
main villa. The new guys and the OG
girls. They went back home with the OG
guys and the new Kasa Moore girls.
yes. Eventually, but when you&#39;re talking
about when first went home,
when they first went home,
but she ended up back at the main villa
while all the other girls were still at
Kasa Moore. if that makes sense.
Those producers are so messy.
It&#39;s so messy. It&#39;s so messy.
Do you guys feel like cuz I feel like
producers did that spin cuz that has
never happened before in Love Island.
You go home, you go home.
I feel like producers did that spin
so she left and came back.
She got voted off and they got in the
jeep like they were going home, but it
was all like uh production spent it like
a little prank.
That&#39;s what the ultimatum was. It&#39;s
either you go home or y&#39;all two can
couple up while y&#39;all got y&#39;all main
connections back at the villas.
But where so messy is one of Alandrea&#39;s
best friends in the villa is is coupled
up with Nick.
Like that was his main connection.
Who? Nick.
Sierra was his main connection.
Oh, right. And then she got kicked.
So they both So Nick and Ela both got
kicked off the show, but then they ended
up on their Jeep and they went to this
private island and they was basically
got a text saying, &#34;You either stay on
the villa and couple up together or
y&#39;all can go home.&#34; So they couple up
but when they went back, they went back
to the original villa where Taylor is
with now his new connection. Yes. Clark.
So then they had to make a vote.
Sierra was still there, too.
That Kasa Moore,
but she don&#39;t even know that they&#39;re
coupled up either cuz producers did
that. Like Oh,
they Kasa Moore thinks they went home.
Yeah. Everybody thinks they went home.
And Kasa Moore,
Yeah. You need to watch Peyton.
I&#39;m not watching now, but
you&#39;re not.
I&#39;m not. Maybe next season. All I know
is I&#39;m definitely team Nicolandria.
Honestly, and one thing that I really
took from it is that I&#39;ve always been so
strong on like, you know, pro black
love, but you may need to explore like
your man may not be who you think he is.
You never know. Like,
so I&#39;m I&#39;m you know, I love to see that
like especially her being a dark-kinned
woman, a black girl, like show like
really like showing that to people
around in our age. like it&#39;s not
something you really see many days like
biracial is it biracial dating
interracial
interracial dating
and it&#39;s like a lot of like not that
America matters but America really
supports them like they really love them
and I&#39;m like okay
I just
I just hope like cuz I feel like it&#39;s
hard to read Alandrea like on if she
really likes
the lies in the lies yeah
because the way she was acting like
towards Taylor it was like you could
tell she really liked Taylor like it&#39;s
to read her on if she really likes Nick
or if she they just have this best
friend vibe that&#39;s like now America&#39;s so
supporting it so they just trying to
stick together. So I don&#39;t know I like
them for now but I want to see for the
long haul like if it was real or if this
is just like since America&#39;s baiting it
so hard they just going with the flow.
Yeah cuz I just would I wouldn&#39;t want
her to settle and suffer because
America likes y&#39;all. It&#39;s not even I did
see though I did see somebody say on
TikTok that Alandrea is kind of like a
little bit more cautious about her
surroundings and not wanting to just be
so open about things on social media.
Like she&#39;s more of a reserved closed off
person. So I feel like now that she&#39;s
out in the real world, we&#39;re expecting
what we saw in the villa. But it&#39;s like
there&#39;s a lot more factors that are
playing into it. So it&#39;s like I can&#39;t be
as open as you want me to. Like you know
I want to share these things but I
can&#39;t. Like maybe she&#39;s just not like,
you know, because she does give a very
much like,
you know, I&#39;m there but I&#39;m I&#39;m not
there. Like you don&#39;t know I&#39;m there but
I&#39;m there type of person.
She&#39;s a pretty
She seems quiet most of the time.
Yeah. Right.
But um back to like Sierra real quick
because when she did her apology, this
I&#39;m just saying like it just becomes too
much. Like when she did her apology or
whatever and she said that after she
said the you know the comment or
whatever like people were
don&#39;t say the word.
I&#39;m just repeating what she said. I&#39;m
not calling them that. I&#39;m just
repeating what she said.
I literally know like multiple people
that have had that in their username
and I know people that have said worse.
So it&#39;s like y&#39;all are canceling her
the n word.
Exactly. Yissa said the N word and y&#39;all
in her home like I feel like okay
whatever either way it goes. Sierra said
the comment but even in her apology
video she said that people were like
seeing death threats to her parents
calling ICE on her family. Like
that&#39;s crazy.
It&#39;s just getting too
Everything this season has been like
heightened very badly like in a bad
direction. Like as soon as you don&#39;t
like somebody like you taking it
personal towards their family like Yeah.
I feel like you&#39;re really just too
invested. You need to go touch grass.
Do y&#39;all think production did the right
thing by removing them or do you think
they should have got consequences after
the fact? Because production making them
leave also
I feel like that made it worse.
It did make it worse. Like but it&#39;s also
like as a as a as a network
I wouldn&#39;t want that. You got to stand.
Do you stand behind the people that work
for you or do you stand behind America
the people? Because
it&#39;s not I feel like if they would have
kept them on there people would have
still watched. But now you making it
worse for the your people that were on
here now where it&#39;s like,
&#34;Wait, so Yelissa got kicked for saying
the N word?&#34;
They found out like back in previous
videos or Tik Toks, whatever. Something
resurfaced in where she said it and they
removed her from the show.
That&#39;s the same thing with Sierra. She
didn&#39;t say it in a villa.
Yeah. So, did her say the N word?
Not on the show.
These are things that they
Wait, Yelissa said it on the show.
Nobody has said these these things
resurfaced from the internet of what
they have said in the past and it
resurfaced and that&#39;s when production
kicked them off the
So I heard Huda said the n-word.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking y&#39;all. Did she or
did she not?
No, I never heard that.
We didn&#39;t hear that on the show. No.
They had digital footprint on the
internet of saying things in the past.
So that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. Like do you
think it was the production go too far
by making them leave the show?
I don&#39;t think so. I think they did the
right thing. I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s
about what you believe, what you stand
on. If I if that was my network, um
that&#39;s not what I go for. So yeah,
you&#39;re going to go home. Anybody that I
hear about is doing any type of stuff
like that, you&#39;re going to go home if I
don&#39;t agree with that. If that was my
network. So I feel like that&#39;s where
Peacock just took that lesson learned
too. Like maybe you have a team
and that&#39;s what it should be like. Just
just look at it as a lesson learned like
like how Sierra apologized. She said it
was years ago. Cuz at first when I saw
her uh clip, I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh my god, was
this recent?&#34; But then I seen how many
years uh It was 2024.
Yeah. How many years? Um
last year that long ago.
No, 2024. I thought it was 2017. Like it
was way back then.
I thought it was way old.
We&#39;re going to have to look up that. How
old is she?
I don&#39;t know. Like
that. I don&#39;t know how old they all are.
Not that invested.
Yeah. I don&#39;t know how old they all are.
Um did you know what she was?
No, it was about Taylor. Like do you
guys think like how he did? Okay. So
yeah. Do you think that I wish I had it,
but do you guys think that he really did
the experiment? Because I feel like
people were also like not upset. There
were some people that wasn&#39;t upset with
him because it&#39;s like he found what he
liked and he went to exploit that and
that&#39;s just what it is.
But I don&#39;t like how you strung her
along just period. Like I don&#39;t know.
Like I just didn&#39;t like it. I didn&#39;t
I seen this tweet and it was like, &#34;Oh,
Taylor owes Alandria an apology for how
he strung her along, blah blah blah.&#34;
And I&#39;m like, does he like he he needs
to apologize for that?
Yeah, they was attacking me for saying
No, I saw you getting attacked for that.
I said, oh my god,
I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t even watch.
Like, but why was Tayen sending
paragraphs like she watches it? Like,
why was
I feel like I watched it. Like, bro,
I feel like she does deserve an apology.
I really
I guess I&#39;ll be devil&#39;s advocate.
You definitely like I don&#39;t know. It
just it speaks to
but also I didn&#39;t watch the show. So
it speaks to the type of person you are
If you it&#39;s plenty of um guys that came
up in there into the house. Um just like
Pepe had told Hood. He said when Hood
tried that he said nah.
He shut that down.
Wait what?
Like people could turn you down. Like
I would cry.
Okay. Well go cry. But he don&#39;t like
you. So you&#39;re not about to be wasting
your time. So you could cry that night.
It&#39;s going to be a bombshell tomorrow.
Yeah. And then what makes it worse with
Taylor is like
when Jaylen was there, then you can see
him putting in this effort
just so that way he can convince her to
pick him.
You know what I&#39;m saying? Like,
and it&#39;s like the sad thing about it is
it&#39;s like after the after watching the
whole show, it&#39;s like, you know what,
Clark, I I actually hate that I like
you. Like,
I actually do like you. You know what
I&#39;m saying? Like, and I actually really
do like you and Taylor.
Y actually cute. I just
I don&#39;t like him.
I don&#39;t like him. and you&#39;re just
associate like by default you&#39;re just
I like him. I think Taylor&#39;s cool. I
just don&#39;t like how he handled the
situation against like
but at the end of the day you did you he
did play the game right. He did like
he didn&#39;t he played it in a coward way.
He played it in a cow coward way like I
would have been told somebody like I I&#39;m
not attracted to you like I&#39;m not about
to fake this
this was his opport Exactly. So it
attests to the type of man that he is
and I feel like that&#39;s how a lot of men
are. Some things also take time to grow.
Also, Taylor was coming on here, I feel
like, with a motive, expanding his or uh
highlighting his modeling career. So,
he&#39;s trying to get exposure.
Yeah, he actually models for Louis
Vuitton and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah, like a good
his family has generational wealth.
Like, he&#39;s really good like setup and
stuff like that. Like, you know, he come
from a good like he come from a good
family and stuff like that. But it just
the way he did Alandria in the villa
just speaks a lot about, you know,
towards him because
if you didn&#39;t like her, that&#39;s all you
had to say was that you didn&#39;t like her
and moved on. If Clark is more your
speed, perfect. And I&#39;m glad you found
her. But to do that to that girl like to
play in that villa for all them on TV.
That&#39;s why she went off on him and
that&#39;s why he he deserved everything
that she
She went off on him.
She barely go off.
Not enough, but she did. She I was from
But okay. She was cursing. Yeah.
I thought you can&#39;t curse on there.
Yeah, you can&#39;t.
You just can&#39;t say the N word.
Yeah. No,
no, not that.
But [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
as a grown woman, when do we hold
Alandre accountable for anything? That&#39;s
what I was saying in my Twitter.
There was definitely remember the
episodes when um you was watching it
with y&#39;all and I was like, I can&#39;t do
her no more. I can&#39;t support her no
Somebody don&#39;t like you
because you know when somebody exactly I
can&#39;t support my queen. She kept on
saying like, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m going back and
waiting.&#34; I was like, &#34;At this point,
the the gesture like it was the
conversation he would give her like dead
and dull and you&#39;re
next time you Yeah. I&#39;m like, man, we&#39;re
really good. We just had a really good
chat.&#34; You didn&#39;t
I feel like Exactly. Sometimes you have
to hold hold yourself accountable.
For the delusion.
Yeah. Not seeing the clear signs that&#39;s
right in front of you. And I feel like
that&#39;s a lot of women.
I don&#39;t Okay. In reality, yes. But on
Love Island though, what if she what
we&#39;re seeing? What if she&#39;s not seeing
What if he&#39;s sitting in her face having
these conversations
and she wasn&#39;t
making dates?
She wasn&#39;t seeing that.
You know, so like
it&#39;s hard like, you know,
I just I&#39;m just irritated cuz
contradicting my own question.
She really Yeah.
She really believed that she that he was
a slow burner and he was not a slow
burner cuz as soon as Clark walked up
like her
two days like that&#39;s what she said. In
two days you you just switched up on me
basically. Like
Yeah. You just didn&#39;t like her.
I did not like you. You you I did not
like you, Taylor. You pecker. Like you
don&#39;t pecker.
I like a woodpecker.
Oh, you three kisses. Yeah, he would
like peck kiss. Like he was like
never make out. Like
it would never be a make out. I was
actually surprised that two girls
actually picked him. Coco. When Coco and
Clark really stood on his heart that
when they first came to the villa, I
said, &#34;Are you going to address Coco?&#34;
Coco blocked her.
Coco blocked me because she came for
y&#39;all. And I&#39;m not going to say she came
for on Winter&#39;s podcast and was
basically talking about
No, Winter said something about So what
do you feel about and then she was like,
&#34;Yeah, Alandria like I just couldn&#39;t get
it.&#34; Like she just kept saying, &#34;My man,
my man, my man delusion
and like you know and Winter&#39;s like,
yeah, she was real delusional.&#34; Like,
well, did she see the delusion in real
Like she was on the villa.
And it&#39;s like not like that. She was in
the house with Taylor and her her friend
Clark, but that&#39;s all she was seeing.
So, it&#39;s like when came back and he
said, &#34;I&#39;m still going to explore both
of you guys. I&#39;m still going to talk to
both of you guys.&#34; You could clearly see
how heavily one-sided it was. So, that
made that&#39;s what made seem like so
delusional. So, I&#39;m like, he probably
really saw that delusion in real time.
Like, damn.
Yeah. But Coco&#39;s also mad. But Coco&#39;s
also mad at Clark because Clark didn&#39;t
pick her when it came when she ran the
Clark I thought Clark was Who was Clark?
Clark is the the
You just need to watch. But
I thought Oh, no. You said Clark didn&#39;t
pick her.
Yeah. So, when it came down to like
who&#39;s going to stay in the villa main
people cost more people who&#39;s going to
stay? Coco. Ace didn&#39;t pick Coco. Okay.
But at the end it was like who&#39;s going
to stay? Alandrea Coco? They have to say
one person. They had to say one person.
Them as a group or person.
The Islanders as a group. They had to
pick one person.
But when the camera was on Clark, she
didn&#39;t even say her answer on camera.
She said,
&#34;Skip me.&#34; Like it&#39;s too heavy. Skip me.
So that&#39;s what&#39;s on the edited episode.
Her saying like when it&#39;s a vote coming
up with her friend,
she was like, &#34;Skip me.&#34;
Why did she vote her own friend off?
Well, she she probably didn&#39;t, but Coco
is saying on this podcast like that was
my girl. Like, you didn&#39;t even you
didn&#39;t even vouch for me at all. Like,
you know, everybody ended up picking to
Not like that. But do you feel like
Clark probably was just like
I feel like Clark wanted to take say
I feel like Clark was at a point to
where like it don&#39;t matter. It&#39;s It&#39;s so
Alandria was staying. You feel me? Like
her people was behind her. Like I feel
like Clark was like it really don&#39;t even
matter. Like she&#39;s kind of going to get
picked. She&#39;s kind of going to stay.
Yeah. Cuz I don&#39;t see Clark like picking
his ex dang near.
Yeah. No. No. I feel like she wanted to
pick her leg to go home, you know? Like
that&#39;s my competition. Like I don&#39;t want
her here. But I&#39;m not going to say
nothing to look like weird. I don&#39;t
think Clark has good TV personality. So
at all.
But yeah. So Coco. Yeah. She&#39;s just
like, so everybody was just attacking
her for coming for Alandria because like
why are you even saying anything about
Alandria? You was on here for like 2
days. You was in the villa for like 2
days or they say or I don&#39;t know how
many days. But yeah, I just Yeah, don&#39;t
talk about her, you know. Damn.
I just feel like people be salty when
they got to go home.
So, let&#39;s talk about the tooth comment
because she did talk about the tooth
comment on what she
so what she said,
there&#39;s nothing wrong with my teeth. was
like cuz she has one yellow tooth right
here. Her her K9 tooth is like one
yellow. She&#39;s like I had tooth gems
and it got stuck and I had it on there
for like two years.
So how big was the stained It stained
the tooth?
The whole tooth.
Like it perfectly stained.
That&#39;s what she said. She&#39;s like
I don&#39;t even have like the white.
She&#39;s like And it&#39;s not even that yellow
in person.
That&#39;s what she said on that podcast.
[Laughter]
she&#39;s never coming on here.
She&#39;s never
Yeah, you&#39;re not invited cuz I&#39;m going
just be staring.
But anyway,
staring at the two.
that&#39;s disrespectful.
No, she&#39;s disrespectful
for lying to us like that cuz that ain&#39;t
I mean, girl, that is not No,
but what&#39;s the reason?
What do you mean what&#39;s the reason? So
why does she just have one stained
tooth? Like
because she had a tooth jail.
That&#39;s her excuse.
No, I&#39;m saying what could be the real
No, I think that&#39;s probably is the
Rotten rotten.
It&#39;s rotten.
The rotten needs to be pulled.
Rotten like I don&#39;t know. It needs to be
pulled and replaced.
You never thought about
you about to bleach.
You never thought about literally
Never thought about that, but the stain
but like she said, it&#39;s not that yellow
in person.
So, the camera lies cuz Peacock got some
pretty clear.
They got some clear cameras. So,
is so messy.
They messy. They When they zoom in,
zoom in.
Yes. So many times where they zoomed in.
Like that&#39;s why everybody was pausing
their TV making Tik Toks like never go
on TV. Like crazy.
On TV for real. So
they were pausing their shows with that
episode. I saw nothing but a tooth down
my whole
I don&#39;t know how I would even do my
hair, bro. Oh my god.
Like that. That&#39;s how Coco had her hair.
No, you can&#39;t do this for 2 months.
Oh, their hair was frying out there.
How do your wigs? So they&#39;ve been doing
their hair.
Yeah, they do their hair like a little
beauty section. You have a vanity
I do not want to be standing on national
television installing a wig. Bro,
what? I don&#39;t have time to do
they be doing that wig.
No, they don&#39;t do they don&#39;t do a wig.
You&#39;re going to have to do like some of
the girls have wigs.
they definitely be having wigs.
Yeah, but I think you should do braids.
But do they do their hair like
Yeah, they have a section like
they do their hair.
Has somebody been on there with a wig
cap putting their wig on with some glue?
I don&#39;t know. I have
There&#39;s been girls like putting glue
like like not putting glue but like
doing a wig like you
I would ask them to not show up.
Like you don&#39;t run the set.
Like you want to go hide?
Can I do my hair in a private room?
No. I heard what a lot of girls I heard
what a lot of girls will do like if they
don&#39;t want to be filmed on certain
parts, they literally can&#39;t film you
naked. So, a lot of girls will put their
wig on naked cuz you can&#39;t put the
camera on me like topless and they&#39;ll
put their wig on and do all that part.
You feel me? And then when they&#39;re at
the curling part, they&#39;ll sit back at
the thing with the top on, you know,
like and curl their hair and have the
juicy conversation cuz some of the
conversations some of the conversations
are held in the dressing room like, you
know, amongst the girls. So, I&#39;ve heard
that a lot of girls sometimes will be
naked because they not about to record
you naked.
That&#39;s so smart. I would do that. Okay.
Like, I need some privacy.
It look like they get no privacy like
shower. All you get is a little a little
That little blur.
So, I said, &#34;Is Love Island season 7 a
reflection of real relationships or is
it just emotionally manufactured for
entertainment?&#34;
I feel like both.
I&#39;ve seen people be like end up in
couples, like for real couples.
Honestly, I feel like Love Island is one
show that has a good track history of
couples that are together. Um, it&#39;s a
couple uh from on there that just got
married. It&#39;s plenty of couples that are
still together. Like I feel like, you
know, because I be watching like Love is
Blind and stuff like that and a lot
they always be breaking up.
A lot of them people never stay
together. Like a lot of other little
dating shows never stay together. But
I&#39;m like low key Love Island like either
it gets you like a great jump start in
your career, the exposure or you get a
great connection and really end up
finding love and being with that person.
Like I feel like a lot of their winners
and couples at the end are still
together. They&#39;re still very successful.
yeah people being scammers.
Yeah. But I feel like it&#39;s still a good
like dating show, but I don&#39;t production
plays a heavy part in manipulating the
the public.
And I feel like they probably too like
have that that them strong connections,
especially whether it&#39;s dating or just
friendship. Um because they they
literally are spending all this time
together, sleeping, waking up, eating
together. Um, but to answer your
question though, I feel like you, it
really is a big reflection on the dating
in today&#39;s time and people who are
siding with certain people. It kind of
gives you an insight on how they think
about relationships and how
relationships should be or how dating
should be.
Is that why they say all Huda&#39;s fans are
little children?
I would see that because Huda does act
like a child and Huda does lack
accountability. Huda doesn&#39;t see the
wrong in her actions. Huda doesn&#39;t take
the time to listen and comprehend. I
don&#39;t think she&#39;s a bad person. And I
feel like that&#39;s a lot of women in
today&#39;s time. It&#39;s like you have these
great women, but they&#39;ve been so broken
from the things that they&#39;ve gone
through that they come into these
relationships and they lack those
things. And I definitely see why a lot
of people would side with her or
understand where she&#39;s coming from. And
then it goes into this big old girls
thing. Like I don&#39;t think all them girls
in there were girls, real girls. Like
that&#39;s just my opinion. But it
definitely is a big reflection and how
Chris treated Huda in the end part.
She wasn&#39;t She&#39;s not used to that.
She&#39;s not used to that. What did he do?
Walk on water. Literally not.
Basically they had their final date. He
carried her to the date, but then by the
end of the date they broke up and she
said they their their date was in water.
Oh, he was like, &#34;I&#39;m not I&#39;m not
holding you. I&#39;m not carrying you.&#34;
And it&#39;s like
she broke up. She ended things with
you just ended things with me. You think
I&#39;m still about to court you?
Yeah. But the point that I was trying to
make with that though is is I felt like
Chris was playing. Although Hua does not
listen. She doesn&#39;t. But in that
particular moment, I felt like Chris was
putting on this facade to make it to put
on this to play this victim role. You
know what I&#39;m saying? Like
but he was the one that&#39;s
he was like, you know, in a sense. Yeah.
You know what I&#39;m saying? And I feel
like that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot that goes on a
lot in our dating.
You&#39;ll deal with men who
they they give you little bits and
pieces and
they breadcrumb you.
Breadcrumb you and then when you just
like you had enough and now you are
reacting to it.
You the one that ended.
Now you&#39;re the bad guy.
But they really like led you to feel
that way because they were too like
cowardly to like admit that they don&#39;t
really like you, not interested in you.
And Chris was waiting on her to just
Well, he said it. He said it.
He did say he said I know you like he
said it. He said he just I think he said
I was just waiting for you to say it.
Yeah, he said something like that. Like
that was his response. Oh, okay. I was
just waiting on you to say like that was
kind of, you know, like you&#39;ve been not
feeling her and turned off by her for a
few days now. So,
he did not look like he liked her in the
clips that I seen.
I mean, I think he really originally
wanted Shelly, but Shel chose up on Ace.
I also think he did like her, too. But
I think he&#39;s And that&#39;s what I wanted to
say. Why do we have to keep saying like
why I don&#39;t want to just put it on Chris
and Jeremiah? Huh? Has things
she just showed both? How do I put this?
Like, she she did the same thing that
she did to Jeremiah to Chris. Like I
just feel like in a way
No accountability.
No accountability. I wouldn&#39;t say that
she cussed out Chris like how she did
Jeremiah. She would call Jeremiah bees.
Like all types of stuff. I&#39;m like dang,
they showing this on TV. Like this is
that type of show. Me as a new viewer.
But yeah, like it just showed like yeah,
she&#39;s she has some traits about her and
it carried in both of those
relationships and those connections. And
that&#39;s why I&#39;m like, okay, let&#39;s not
attack Jeremiah and let&#39;s not attack
Chris. She just really has like she just
has some growing to do. He has a lot of
growing to do when it comes to men at
least. I don&#39;t know. Like she said on
that podcast, she&#39;s used to men just
being all over her
and these guys was not doing that.
That&#39;s why she like Jeremiah cuz he was
all over her
in the beginning.
And Chris was not going for that. When
he didn&#39;t see something that he liked,
he was not all all over her.
Mhm. But um
so their biggest thing in their
relationship about privacy is
if we&#39;re we can kiss in the bedroom in
the dark under the covers, but we she&#39;s
not a big fan of PDA because when she
did when she did um uh show PDA, they
made it seem like she was doing too
much. So now she&#39;s like, &#34;Let me not do
too much. So, I&#39;ll kiss you in bed, but
I don&#39;t want to kiss you like out in
front of everybody when we&#39;re out
walking around.
Does that make sense?
And that was kind of what their argument
If somebody told you that, what would
mind you, they&#39;ve also or had
But also, mind you, you&#39;re in a room
with other couples. You&#39;re all in the
same room, but you don&#39;t want to kiss me
in front of them.
So, she didn&#39;t. Yes.
So, yeah. So, you know how they sleep.
So, when they would go into get into the
bed, she would want to be like, you
know, affectionate, holding his hand
like cuddle like she They didn&#39;t want to
do that in front of other people,
but when they were outside and mind you,
they sleeping like all next to each
other. So people hear them being
affectionate in the bed and stuff, but
then when you
So they have next to other people.
Some people do crazy, but and then when
they get outside, I&#39;ve done that.
When they get outside,
they would want to perfect for the show.
When they get outside, they would want
to like she wanted no PDA, no nothing.
I kind of understood her.
I kind of get it.
I don&#39;t get that. you&#39;re okay with
having sex with some with other people
in the room right next to you, but you
don&#39;t want to kiss me in front of our
village. Well, all of our villa
partners, our family, like that does not
make any sense.
No, it doesn&#39;t really make that much
My only thing with when she said that
I get you in a sense of how hard the
villa was on you about when you was with
but if that&#39;s you, don&#39;t switch up on
you cuz I don&#39;t care about y&#39;all opinion
in this villa. like if this if I really
like him, I&#39;m going to show him that I
really like him, you know?
I feel like that gave off very weird
vibes to only try to be affectionate and
for him in the bed. Like that&#39;s very
weird. So you telling me if your
boyfriend say, &#34;Yeah, when we at home,
he be all over you, but when y&#39;all out
at the mall, he want to he want to he
want to walk like 50 feet away from
No. No holding hand. She didn&#39;t want to
hold his hand. You can&#39;t say that. You
can&#39;t do that.
Actually, we don&#39;t have time for that.
so yeah,
I do though. Like I get it. Like you
but yeah, don&#39;t go on on podcast now and
start bashing Chris talking about he
didn&#39;t even really put the whole thing
in. It wasn&#39;t all that. Now it&#39;s all
girl. You got two bodies.
You got two bodies in the building like
crazy. Well, two months.
I mean, Iris too.
Iris was just easy though. I just want
Iris is just easy.
Poor poop. So,
who did she with?
Oh, TJ
Wood. Wait,
I thought she had sex with TJ.
Hannah. Pepe was just getting some
action. Okay. Hannah.
Pepe is cute.
Charlie. Did she?
No, it was Char. It was Hannah and Pepe.
Iris and Pepe.
But who has twice?
Who knows?
Anyways, congrats to the winners, Amaya
and Brian. Welld deserved.
It&#39;s crazy because I feel like even
though they won, nobody&#39;s talking about
them. Yeah, it&#39;s really a Shelly Nickel.
A Shell&#39;s PR is going crazy right now.
Like that&#39;s what I had just seen that
somebody said that. Somebody said
yeah, the black people showing out.
Somebody said Peacock fumbled.
Peacock fumbled. As
Shelly should have won because their
winners aren&#39;t even getting as much
traction as they thought they would.
And they said Huda and um
the breakup. Like that was like the
first time that&#39;s happened.
It happened on Love Island. Like the
finalist like breaking up at the finals
is crazy. cuz they really should not
even have been finalists. Like
literally, Ace and Shel should have been
in a finalist.
Fan base really like messes up. They
ride for her. So,
I also think they all need therapy after
this. Like I think Love Island.
So, that leads into your question.
Yeah. I&#39;m trying to
I think Love Island is like y&#39;all think
it&#39;s psychological torture. I think
Yeah. Talk about two months.
What you said when you said that that&#39;s
luxury prison and I made that made me
think like yeah like no phones for two
months. You&#39;re on a strict diet. Then I
heard that they make you do like lymph n
like they do like stuff to keep you like
flat during the day. Make sure your
stomach&#39;s flat. Like they train you on
this type of stuff. And I&#39;m like dang
like this sound like boot camp in a way.
like I really want to sit with like not
sit with we&#39;ll talk to one of the
islanders and I want to really know the
Yeah. Like I really want to know like
okay so behind the scenes and when you
guys cut off like okay and what&#39;s the
dinner like? Like what&#39;s everything like
behind the scenes? Because
to me it really gives like luxury
prison. Like I think I would need
therapy after that. Like not like that,
but like especially
my connection did what Taylor did.
Oh my god. Yeah.
Like if my connection did like that and
then now I&#39;m just
you just got to see your person that you
was just with with another person in
your face.
Like in the real world, we don&#39;t deal
with that like in in their face. We have
distraction, you know? Like they could
they could be on to the next person or
something, but that&#39;s not something we
have to deal with. And see, we don&#39;t
have to sleep next to them. Like I would
have crashed out. Love Island would have
been baddies.
Oh my god.
I would have crashed out. Like there&#39;s
no way I can keep it cute and keep it
like cute on TV. Especially if my
connection is really that and they not
playing it on. They trying to like spin
it on TV cuz you don&#39;t even they don&#39;t
even know what we&#39;re seeing every day,
every week. They have no idea. Like
Yeah. That&#39;s what someone I forgot who
said it. They was like, &#34;You can see
only 10 minutes out of a 24-hour day.&#34;
Literally. And then when I was listening
to Jeremiah talk, he said that their
sleeping schedule, like they&#39;re filming
from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. like
Yes. Um and get like three hours sleep.
He said, &#34;Yeah, they get like two three
hours of sleep.&#34; Chris said that&#39;s why
he had turned hooded down when she um
tried to like
Yeah. tried to 321 him.
Um he he was like, &#34;I don&#39;t play about
my sleep. If I had two hours of sleep
and you&#39;re tapping that Yeah. That&#39;s
crazy. We get two hours of sleep and you
t Oh girl, I crashed out. Like
that&#39;s what Jeremiah was saying too. He
was like I didn&#39;t have enough time. Like
he was like that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t talk to
her right after cuz I didn&#39;t even have
enough time to really process all that
was going on. Like and I&#39;m like I I
could really see that. Like I really
want to know like a telloff like
I really want to know behind
like the details. Yeah. I wonder if they
sign an NDA though.
Like can they not say certain stuff
about the show?
But why why you can&#39;t talk about the
behind the scenes program? Like I just
want to know the schedule behind the
scenes. Maybe a lot of them don&#39;t want
them to know the detail.
Maybe they just don&#39;t want that
publicized.
Your friend Kayla, I was seeing her
TikTok. She said she auditioned
for Love Island and she was trying to go
into detail about it and I was like,
&#34;Dang, you got to be on this island.&#34;
Kayla Kayla like
Yeah, the twin.
Um, yeah. When she was like saying that
you got to be on this villa and it&#39;s
like pre-trials and I&#39;m like, dang. Then
you got a pre-trial to see if you
actually make the show.
Yeah. They say like it&#39;s a whole
process. M
Well, lucky to the ones that made it do
what y&#39;all do
and not seeing your family for all that
time, man. Not talking to them,
bro. Literally crazy.
I would that episode was actually very
like I actually cried that episode
visit them.
It was so beautiful.
I really I don&#39;t even know how Hood did
that with her. I couldn&#39;t even like
that. I can&#39;t even be away from my dog.
I can&#39;t FaceTime my dog like and I got
to be away from him for two months. So,
let alone if I had a child.
A child. I don&#39;t know. No contact with
my child for two months. Not a FaceTime.
Not a are you okay? Did you get a
scratch today? Like what happened?
Did they bring her child?
No, they don&#39;t.
She just reunited with her child like
two days ago.
But she made a little video for her mom
and like mom, I just finished my first
year of school. Why would you miss that?
Either way, go. She did explain on that
call her daddy podcast that&#39;s like what
did she say? Like her her dad like the
dad is very much so.
She got a good village which is very
that&#39;s very good. very I&#39;m just saying
like some people as a mom can&#39;t separate
from their kids for that long. Like
but this just goes to show how crazy
like social social media is because why
would y&#39;all call CPS on her?
why would y&#39;all do that? Like like as if
she&#39;s not there for her kid like she
don&#39;t like her child&#39;s just neglecting
two parents.
Mind your business cuz she never like
she I don&#39;t know if she said she was a
single mother. I know her and the dad is
not together but she never said she was
like parenting alone. Like she never
said she didn&#39;t have a village or
anything. So I feel like y&#39;all need to
mind your business. her her kids was
definitely with her family like safe
like the girl was good but calling CPS
on somebody you don&#39;t get that involved
in nobody&#39;s business that&#39;s crazy
do you think Hood should have just left
the fact that she was a mom off and just
kept that to herself
no let it be known it was going to be
found but I feel like it was made such a
big thing like for that she&#39;s a mom like
I feel like
she was the first she&#39;s the first one
violet has never like casted on like
somebody else her Gmail
like I don&#39;t No.
Would y&#39;all do Love Island?
Yeah. If I had to look,
I feel like I would I would if if they
had like if they accepted, you know, all
I found it. All kind.
All kind like you know, you went on
They have a certain look. You know what
I&#39;m saying? Like
you can probably find it on Tik Tok.
They have a look. That one girl that
came was on there. She was not cute with
all them fillers. Oh, but after when she
got off, she did look decent. I&#39;m not
going to lie. But I definitely do love.
I just think
I don&#39;t know the I feel I cuz even if
you didn&#39;t like Vanna&#39;s looks,
the things that they were saying to her
like and I was saying
what they say
just being extremely mean like just
being very very mean. And it was like
when she got out the villa like you know
her people were telling her like you
know don&#39;t don&#39;t like look at your phone
yet. You know you should be dissolve
them feelings. You should be around
family. You are part of the problem
I&#39;m sorry. They&#39;re telling the truth.
Like sometimes you have blindness when
some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] look crazy. Like
take it. It&#39;s not uh cuz she was pretty
without it. I&#39;ve I saw before pictures.
Yeah. I&#39;ve seen
she was actually look good.
I just think they&#39;re
Why do you say when she got out the
villa she looked good? Like what
Because I don&#39;t know. For some reason it
just didn&#39;t look like the fillers were
so exemplified. Like it she looked like
she had a normal face. Well, I did hear
that she did say the tooth thing.
I did hear that they said that like the
cameras like those type of cameras put
filters to make them look I seen that on
TikTok like they was like saying like
the cameras whatever cameras they have
it can beautify their faces and like if
they just wake up they&#39;ll look like
fresher in the morning like it just like
I don&#39;t know technology
she was allergic to the pillows and she
who said that
she said she was allergic to the
pillows. Also, her face swell up.
That&#39;s what it said.
What? I never heard that.
I just didn&#39;t think they had to crucify
her on the internet like that for her
looks. Like, you don&#39;t know how that&#39;s
going to make somebody feel every day.
That is They were just so mean to her.
Okay. Is it Wait, I
got a text.
Oh my god.
Let&#39;s see what it says.
Let&#39;s see. It says, &#34;Hi guys. Advice,
please. What&#39;s up, you guys? First and
foremost, I&#39;ll try to make this as brief
as possible, but I want to say that I
love all of you guys and thank you for
giving me and my cousin something to
look forward to when you guys post new
episodes on the pod. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s
your sexual orientations are, and I
thought I was sure of mine until now. Me
and my man been together for three going
on four years now, and we just recently
moved in together. Like any other
couple, we have our icks about one
another, but we love each other, and we
love living together so far. However,
recently, I just discovered that I&#39;m
starting to pick up a different feeling
when it comes to women. M oh I don&#39;t
have a crush on a specific woman at the
moment but I am starting to find my
boyfriend to be a little less attractive
and women are starting to get a lot more
of my attention lately. I&#39;ve never been
in a serious relationship with a girl
but I&#39;ve had had sexual encounters with
one or two or two in the past back in
high school. Lately I have been a little
more curious about what it would be like
to have attention from a woman. I&#39;ve
been a little more into baggy clothes as
well. And oddly enough, I tried to
imagine if I changed my style and
dressed like Brent Fias, but
but kept it a little feminine, lol. I
know this sounds silly and may be dumb,
so I&#39;m thinking that maybe this is all
just a phase I&#39;m going through. However,
I am only 21 and my boyfriend is 23. We
have no kids, so I would
I know how
Yeah, must be nice. So, I know how easy
it is for me to make whatever decision I
want right now, but like I said, I
really want I really love him and I&#39;m
scared of what he may think if I wanted
to step outside the box so quickly. Is
there easier ways to read into this? Am
I just going through a phase? Any advice
what I should do? I feel like men will
like that you like women.
Some guys will think that&#39;s cheating.
Yeah, not the way that she&#39;s looking.
Yeah, I&#39;ve has said that.
Yes. I literally got accused of cheating
because I kissed a girl. Like,
but I thought they would like that.
Like, that&#39;s a kink, right? Like, oh,
two women like
Maybe that. Yeah. Is it cheating because
you&#39;re not involved?
Okay. That&#39;s what it is. Okay. You&#39;re
mad. Okay.
It sounds like I don&#39;t know. From what I
got from it, it sounds like more of like
a sexual tension type of thing. So,
maybe you should talk to your
your boyfriend and see how he feels
about bringing in like a third party.
Maybe have like
trying out a threesome.
Why not though?
It&#39;s getting spicy.
The boys don&#39;t care about that. Like if
you&#39;re going to bring another girl to
the mix,
but if you&#39;re going to bring another
girl, I feel like, okay, some, but
majority, I feel like majority of them
would be okay with that.
I feel like it&#39;s so common in today&#39;s
time, like the the poly relationships,
dating multiple people.
So, I I I don&#39;t see it being a problem.
Like, if you are like interested in that
and you&#39;re in your relationship and you
want to respect him, maybe bring it up
to him first and see what his ideas are
about, you know, about that. But if you
I don&#39;t know like because you ever get
drunk I&#39;m not gonna lie I&#39;m not I&#39;m you
know what is it heterosexual
heterosexual
sis yeah um but when I get drunk like
yeah I love I love females especially if
you bad and cute like twerk on me like
you know what I&#39;m saying like
your your titties a little bit like
but like do I want to eat your coochie?
but like you know oops sorry but like
you know like you I feel like you know
you get a little interested but how far
you want to go
or you could disguise it as playing with
your man like like surprise him one day
like hm you got a little partner at the
end of the day it&#39;s like in your head
you know what you&#39;re doing it for but to
make it comfortable maybe invite her too
if that makes sense does that make sense
what I&#39;m saying
like you&#39;re doing it for yourself in
your head don&#39;t tell him that but you
know bring it up and I feel like
once you tell a guy that he probably
like she made this surprise for me like
she doing this for me.
I don&#39;t know. I think if you bring that
into the relationship knowing you
already kind of said like your boyfriend
is like lowkey becoming less attractive
and girls are like peing your interest
I would kind of choose up like if you
don&#39;t want to be with him no more. You
don&#39;t have to. You literally don&#39;t.
She does not not want to be with him.
Yeah. She says she love them and stuff,
but if you feeling a way, you know, like
you said, everybody got their eggs about
each other. But I feel like if you
really want to go explore girls and see
if that&#39;s really what you like, I feel
like you should definitely dead things
with him. I don&#39;t think you should bring
no threesome into the room knowing you
heavily like girls a little more, you
And you&#39;re 21, so you have so much.
I feel like you guys, that&#39;s why I said
you got so much time. You could really
go play with not play with that side.
Please don&#39;t play with nobody. But you
could really go and see if that&#39;s really
what you like. If that&#39;s really what
you&#39;re into. But I don&#39;t feel like you
should have nobody on the side or
leading him on. I don&#39;t feel like none
of that. I feel like karma.
But go explore for sure. You got time,
And don&#39;t go dress like Brent fire ass.
And yeah, go your own little stylist.
Like how does he really dress? Like I
don&#39;t know. I never baggy clothes.
Like I be thinking he wear like trench
coats and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Like baggy clothes like
Yeah. Okay, back.
Leather jacket,
but she says she grows it up a little
Nice watch,
Yeah, you. Yeah.
I say, girl, give it a try.
I say do it and just tell your man.
Like, why not? Like,
give it a give it a try. But just Yeah.
just let him know it&#39;s not gonna work
out if you really do want to start going
or just ease it in there like you gonna
like just bring another girl to the
bedroom and see how he goes about it.
Best of both worlds.
I always bring things up that I want to
talk about in a joking matter just to be
like oh if you
I was just joking.
I was just thinking about
I wasn&#39;t going to do it. I was just
thinking about it.
Would you threesome? Haha.
That&#39;s Brian.
I always said if I was to have a
threesome, I would have to be the
add-on. I don&#39;t see like I I don&#39;t know.
Oh, you want the couple to ask you,
okay, to invite you to the bedroom.
I had two.
I have to be real secure in my man to
like be okay with watching.
Yeah. I don&#39;t know. Like
just not built for
Yeah. Probably the add-on. Like not my
man. Yeah.
Your man.
Yeah. I&#39;m thinking your man.
