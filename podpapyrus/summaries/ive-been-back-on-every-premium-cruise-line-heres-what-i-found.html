I&#39;ve recently revisited all five of what
the industry calls premium cruise lines.
As I keep getting asked which is the
best these days, many cruisers are
confused by all the recent changes in
the fleets, onboard offerings, tweaks to
inclusions and exclusions, and the
seeming push by all to attract a
different passenger type. Welcome
aboard. I&#39;m Gary Benbridge and I&#39;m going
to compare each line, including what
they&#39;re best known for, good at, what
they&#39;re less good at, and who I think
should cruise with them right now and
why. But before I dive into the
individual lines, let me talk about the
premium category. What it is and
importantly what it is not. The cruise
industry divides cruise lines into five
key categories. The biggest by far
carrying almost 2/3 of passengers every
year is the mainstream resort value line
category. This includes Royal Caribbean,
Carnival, MSE Cruises, and Norwegian
Cruise Line. The second biggest category
carrying almost 20% of passengers a year
is the premium category. The main lines
in here are Princess Cruisers, Holland
America, Kunard Cruise Line, Celebrity
Cruisers, and Virgin Voyages. Disney are
also considered to be in here due to
their pricing, while Pino Cruisers UK
used to be in here, but they have moved
to become a more mainstream resort value
line. The third category is small ship
luxury cruising with ships of around a
thousand passengers with lines like
Viking, Oceanania, Winstar, Azamara and
Explorer Journeys. Then there is the
ultra luxury category with even smaller
ships or suites. Many inclusions with
lines like region 7C seas, Seaborn,
Silver Sea, Crystal, Heploid and the new
ultra luxury yacht lines. The fifth
category is regional and local lines
ranging from Margaritaville at sea in
the United States to Fred Olsson and
Saga in the UK and Aida Mineshift and
Costa within Europe. Next, all the
premium lines have very similar
characteristics. First, they tend to be
midsize to large ships, mostly carrying
from 2,00 to 3,500 passengers and have
more space and crew per guest than those
mainstream resort lines, so they&#39;re less
crowded and generally have better
service. They have very classic cruise
ship designs and layouts. They don&#39;t
have resort features and attractions
like water slides, flow riders,
amusement arcades, climbing walls, and
so on. But they do have a sizable choice
of bars and dining options on their
ships. They do offer a classic cruise
program with emphasis on enrichment,
things like trivia, dancing, live music.
They do have production shows, but
they&#39;re not as big and glitzy or named
shows as on the resort lines. They
mostly have decent but not expensive
kids clubs too. They have a wide range
of cabins from inside to suites. Their
fairs are roughly about twice the price
of those resort lines, but they still
have many add-on charges like those do.
Wi-Fi, gratuitities, drinks packages,
and special dining, for example. They do
tend to cruise more across the world
than those mainstream resort lines.
Those mostly offering Caribbean,
Mediterranean, and Alaska cruises.
Premium go much more around the world.
The Carnival Corporation is most heavily
invested in this category. They own
three of the five premium lines,
Princess, Holland America, and Kunard.
So, with all that in mind, let&#39;s dive
into each of the lines. And we&#39;re going
to start with the largest based on
passengers carried down to the smallest.
And the biggest of them is Princess
Cruisers. Princess have the biggest
fleet with 17 ships across five
different classes of ships, ranging from
the new 4,300 passenger sphere class to
the over half that number, 2,000
passenger coral class. These days,
they&#39;re best known for their wearable
medallionbased technology approach to
classic premium cruising. This helps
speed check-in. It unlocks your cabin
door as you approach it. It&#39;s used for
purchases on the ship. It lets you track
and find friends and family. It allows
the crew to recognize and call you by
name as well. Because they have the
biggest and most diverse fleet, they
homebase ships in various parts of the
world across the year. So, they offer a
wide range of itineraries, meaning
cruisers who really like Princess can
keep finding new routes to explore.
They&#39;re also very strong in Alaska with
many ships there in the season, as well
as running trains and lodges. Prince has
also become increasingly well known for
offering family and multigenerational
travel and is the most active and packed
daily program of all the premium lines
in my view ranging from dance classes,
game shows, trivia, silent discos,
high-tech production shows and so on.
The ships are focused around the patza,
the atrium which acts as the heart of
the ships with many of the bars, the
restaurants, the entertainment venues
radiating around it and there&#39;s many
activities and live music held in the
patza. This makes it buzzy and very
vibrant heart of the ship. They&#39;ve also
shifted to a big focus on their
all-inclusive packages with their
Princess Plus and Princess Premier
packages where you can buy a bundle
which includes things like drinks,
Wi-Fi, casual and especially dining and
so on. In my view, their biggest
weakness is the move into larger and
larger ships which is timed with a clear
shift to appeal to younger
multigenerational and family travelers.
Of course, in the those key vacation
periods, the new classes of ships are
busier and rowdier, especially in
vacation times when they are sailing
over capacity with many kids sharing
parents&#39; cabins. For example, this was
the case on my recent Sun Princess
cruise where kids actually took over the
main pools. Another weakness is the push
on selling and upselling. Up to 30% of
the daily program activities on C days
on my two recent cruises were actually
revenue raising based. Despite all all
of that, they have a strong 3.8 out of
five passenger rating on sites at Cruise
Critic. Although I am seeing more mixed
reviews recently, mostly driven probably
by traditional older cruisers finding
the new bigger ships less appealing. So,
who are Princess best for these days?
Well, they are still ideal for anyone
wanting a busy classic cruise experience
with lots going on even late into the
evening. They&#39;re one of the best premium
options in my view for families and
multigenerational travel, especially on
the new Sun and Star Princess. While
across the fleet, it is still probably
well suited for 50 plus couples looking
though for a busy, lively, energetic
classic experience. Having no solar
cabins and usually no solo deals, they
cater definitely less well for solo
travelers. So, let&#39;s move on to
Celebrity Cruisers, which is the next
biggest premium line. based on
passengers carried. Celebrity has 13
ships in their classic fleet and one
expedition ship in the Galapagus. The
classic fleet has three classes. The new
3,000 passenger Edge class, the 2,800
passenger Solsters class, and the
smaller 2,200 passenger Millennium
class. Celebrity is trying to be the
most luxurious of the premium lines,
claiming to offer modern luxury. They do
also, by the way, tend to have slightly
higher fairs than their competition on
most sailings. They&#39;re one of the two
more overtly status baselines in the
category with dedicated spaces based on
the cabin grade taking up big parts of
the ship. They have the retreat ship and
ship for suites, which includes the
exclusive lumini restaurant, the retreat
lounge, and the retreat deck. These are
especially large and elevated on the
edgeclass ships. They then have aqua
class with a dedicated blue restaurant
which are for concierge balcony mini
street kind of cabins with regular
cabins allocated to the main dining
room. Although on edge class instead of
one there are four restaurants with
different cuisine themes that guests
move between which does offer more
variety. They&#39;re also known for trying
to attract younger cruisers and more
families, particularly with the
trendier, sophisticated, and modern
edgeclass ships. This has strikingly
different hull, different internal
layout, different decor, these infinite
balcony cabins. They have the magic
carpet on the side of the ship that&#39;s
used as a bar and restaurant. They&#39;re
lower to act as a tender boat platform.
These are much happier and trendier.
While offering a classic daily program
on all the ships, they do try to give
events a more modern twist with more
game show style trivia, more deck
parties, more contemporary, and
definitely much more up-to-date music
and production shows that use much more
up to-ate music. They use technology,
acrobatics. The program is not as packed
as Princess, though. They do have some
obvious weaknesses, but these may be a
strength based on your point of view.
But in my experience, you get different
experiences based on the ship class that
you&#39;re going on. So much so that it can
often feel like you&#39;re on a different
cruise line, based on the class you go
on. So if you&#39;re on the edgeclass ships,
it has a more youthful, trendier vibe,
look, different layout, different
experiences, different dining venues.
While I found on the Solstice Sim
Millennium class, it was way more
conserved, traditional, classic in every
respect. The ships have a darker
palette. They&#39;re actually getting a bit
dated both in terms of venues and
cabins. Although Celebrity have
announced that they will be updating all
the Solstice class ships, but that&#39;s
going to take some years to roll out.
But saying all that, they get the
highest passenger rating of all the
longestablished premium lines with a
four out of five rating on sites like
Cruise Critic with a new edgeclass ships
definitely helping elevate ratings. So,
in my view, they&#39;re best for people who
want a classic cruising experience, but
with a kind of contemporary, modern,
sophisticated spin, but without going as
edgy as Virgin has done. and that I will
talk about later. They are very good for
couples with younger ages, probably 30,
40s, like to find edgeclass more to
their taste, while older couples are
like to find the Solstice or Millennium
a better fit. They&#39;re also a very good
option for LGBT cruiser couples. They
market to that uh category of travelers.
Solos will also find some solo cabins
with edgeclass catering best for them.
So, this brings me on to the third
largest line, Holland America line. Hall
America has 11 ships across four
classes. The newer 3,200 passenger
Pinnacle class, the 2,500 passenger
Signature class, the 2,400 passenger
Vista class, and the older 1,700
passenger Rotterdam class. Holland
America offers a much more traditional
cruising experience, but without being
too formal. It&#39;s also known as being a
little bit more quiet and sedate,
certainly versus the two I&#39;ve discovered
so far. They&#39;re especially well known
for offering probably the best
destination range and options in the
premium category. And they cover much of
the world, often with longer and more
immersive journeys. They&#39;re also an
Alaska expert, sitting there for over 70
years, and they run trains and lodges,
too. On those longer journeys, they are
very well known for good destination
talks and emotion, like I experienced
firsthand on my South America partial
circumnavigation.
They have a big focus on live music.
Although much to regular cruisers&#39;s
annoyance, they have dialed back on
classical music by ending their
partnership with the Lincoln Center. But
on the newer Pinnacle class ships, they
have the Rolling Stone rock room. They
have BB Kings and Billboard on board
with two pianists. The smaller ships
just have a Rolling Stone lounge which
has a large band. They play a more mixed
set of music genres and then they do
have the Billboard on board menu. I find
dining competitive, probably not as
groundbreaking as some of the others in
the category. And they have four main
specialty venues, Pinnacle Grill,
Tamarind, Rudy&#39;s, Selameare, and
Canaltto. While they have some areas
like a small lounge and dedicated dining
areas for guests and suites is not as
elevated or expansive as Celebrity and
also any cabin grade can access some of
the areas like those dining areas by
buying a club orange package. So, it&#39;s
not as kind of locked down for people in
suites. In terms of the weaknesses,
their production shows are probably the
weakest of all the premium category
lines, certainly currently. And for
some, they find it too sedate, too
quiet, not a lot of energy and things
not going kind of later into the
evenings. In terms of passenger rating,
they actually get the same rating as
Princess, 3.8 out of five on Cruise
Critic. So, a strong rating overall. In
my view, Holland America is best for
couples who looking for a classic
traditional cruise. not too formal,
maybe a little bit more sedate, less
boisterous, and certainly less busy
compared to Princess and Celebrity. And
definitely looking for more enrichment,
much more destination options, and
especially looking for longer cruises.
So, this brings me to the most formal of
all the lines and the next in terms of
size, which is Kunard Cruise Line.
Kunard have four ships in three
different classes. the 2,700 passenger
Queen Mary 2, the 2,000 passenger Vista
class, so that&#39;s Queen Elizabeth and
Queen Victoria, and a stretched Holland
America 3000 passenger Pinnacle class.
Kunard offers a few unique things. First
of all, two classic heritage routes, the
scheduled regular transatlantic
crossings between Southampton and New
York and Queen Mary 2, and World
Voyages, which all of the fleet do at
the start of every single year.
Secondly, they&#39;re the only premium line
offering a traditional British cruising
experience, while all the others offer a
more American cruising experience. The
ships have a rich art deco decor,
although Queen has dialed that back
quite significantly. Next, they are most
associated with having a class-based
structure on board, but as you&#39;ve of
course heard, they&#39;re not the only ones
doing it, with Celebrity also doing
that. In some way, Celebrity even more
so based on the amount of space they
allocate. But like Celebrity on Kunard,
the restaurant you dine in depends on
your cabin type. So on here, it&#39;s Queens
Grill for sweets, Princess Grill for
mini suites, and Bratana Club or
Bratannia for everybody else. Queens and
Princess Grill have a different menu.
They have a dedicated kitchen from the
Bratannia main dining room and
definitely have elevated food, elevated
menu. Off menu ordering is possible,
too. Fourthly, Kunard is known as being
the most formal and traditional of the
premium lines. Although it&#39;s much more
relaxed than a few years ago, it has a
stricter dress code that is enforced. So
on formal nights, almost all gents will
be dressed in black tie, tuxedo or a
suit and tie and ladies in smart gowns.
Fifthly, they have a large orchestra and
ballroom dancing every night. They have
a major afternoon tea event in the
Queen&#39;s room and the focus of the daily
program is enrichment talks with up to
four speakers on most sailings. So in
terms of their weaknesses, I think one
of the weaknesses is their advertising
and marketing makes Kunard sound very
luxurious, very sophisticated, but once
you&#39;re on board, you find it&#39;s actually
not different to the other premium lines
I&#39;ve been talking about with food
offerings in Britannia really matching
the other lines. Service very much the
same as the other lines. It&#39;s not as
elevated as people expect. I see another
weakness emerging is the visible cost
cutting and added charges. For example,
charging for room service for Bratannia
cabin guests after 10:00 a.m. was
introduced just before I make that. But
there&#39;s noticeably more upselling. Many
more generating revenue generating
activities. Another weakness I think is
the ships are getting dated, especially
Queen Mary 2 cabins, though those on
Queen Victoria and Elizabeth are getting
a little bit dated too. Now I can see in
recent ratings that cruisers are much
more critical of Kuno than they have
been and they actually get the lowest
rating of premium lines. So if I look at
the last 6 months it&#39;s about 3.2 out of
five but all time is about 3.7. So
definitely a little bit of weakness in
the ratings but I still feel they are
really good for people wanting a
traditional more formal and classic
British cruising experience. And you
want to know if you want to know the
passengers will all be dressed up on
formal nights. There&#39;s going to be lots
of enrichment. There&#39;s going to be
ballroom dancing. then this is the only
premium line where you can be sure that
you&#39;re going to get that on every
cruise. This does tend to mean that most
fellow passengers will be their 60s7s
and above. Normally very British because
the ships are mostly UK homebased. So
the next line I want to talk about and
the smallest of these currently is
Virgin Voyages. They have four identical
ships carrying 2,700 passengers each.
They&#39;re best known for being the only 18
plus adult only premium line and of
course for trying to be different to the
other premium cruise lines with more
edgy entertainment, more party events,
big focus on wellness and definitely way
more inclusions in the base fair like
all of the food. So no specialy dining
charges, gratuitities and Wi-Fi in the
fair. They do not have a main dining
room, but they have a series of
restaurants like the wake, which is a
steakhouse, rattleled dazzle,
vegetarian, gumbai, Korean barbecue,
pink a Mexican test kitchen, and so on.
The food is extremely good on Virgin and
probably some of the best if not the
best across the the premium lines. They
claim to not have a buffet, said they
have the galley, which is a food court
concept. One of the weaknesses of Virgin
Voyages is they have very limited
destinations focused on the
Mediterranean and the Caribbean. though
they are now starting some West Coast
and Alaska cruising. They&#39;ve tried
cruising other regions like Australia,
but they&#39;ve pulled out of those. They
have the highest passenger ratings of
all the premium lines, just beating out
Celebrity with a rating of 4.1 out of
five on Cruise Critic. So, really strong
ratings. Now, they&#39;re ideal for adults
30s to 50s probably who want a classic
cruise. So, they don&#39;t want big ship
resort features, but they want a a
classic line that&#39;s premium, trendier,
more hip than all the others, but they
really want a good focus on food and
wellness. It&#39;s worth noting that the
average age on board, based on comments
in the trade press, is actually around
50 years old. So, it&#39;s not as young as
many people expect, so don&#39;t be put off
if you are older. It&#39;s suitable and
popular, by the way, with LGBT travelers
as well. As you reflect on all of this,
