from the halls of montezuma to the
shores of tripoli
are the beginning lines from the united
states marine corps hymn
and the tripoli that&#39;s mentioned is the
largest city in today&#39;s libya
the hymn was written sometime after 1867
and these lines commemorate two of the
marine corps most famous battles
the halls of montezuma referring to the
mexican-american war of
1846 to 48
and the shores of tripoli refers to the
battles the marine corps along with the
u.s navy
fought with the infamous barbary pirates
who terrorized the coast of north africa
the mediterranean sea
and indeed a large part of europe
for three centuries

the barbary coast of north africa
stretches from eastern morocco to
tripoli just under 1 000
the name barbary has nothing to do with
barbarians
barbary is the anglicized version of
the native non-arab peoples of the
the berbers had been famous warriors and
raiders by land when they and their
allies decided to take to the sea in the
late 1400s and early 1500s
many of the berber tribes were joined by
refugees both muslim and jewish
who were either fleeing or being forced
out of spain
as the spanish under ferdinand and
isabella carried out the reconquista
the reconquest of much of spain after
seven centuries of arab muslim rule
the trade of countless nations flowed
across around and out of the
mediterranean
and the barbary pirates wanted their
piece of it spices gold
gems and much else from the middle east
and india were carried over the waves of
the mediterranean
so were food items wine
raw materials and much else from europe
the ships carrying these goods were one
of the prime targets of the pirates
but the most lucrative good wasn&#39;t
pepper from india or frankincense from
persia it was human beings
slavery had existed in the mediterranean
basin since before the time of rome
during the roman expansion
people from all corners of the empire
were enslaved
germans slavs greeks various people from
the balkans africans traded to rome by
egypt jews from israel and more some of
the richest people in rome and the
gothic and arab empires which followed
it were slave traders
many viking raiders grew rich and
powerful from the treasure they hoarded
trading slaves
slavery was common in europe the north
coast of africa and the middle east
until relatively recent times
in the 1500s the ottoman turks expanded
along the north african coast due to
distance and the fiercely independent
nature of the berbers and others however
ottoman control of the barbary coast was
nominal as long as the people there
recognized the ottoman sultan as their
overlord and gave help when it was asked
the turks left the people of the coast
one of the many interesting things about
the barbary pirate is that as time went
on many of them were not from the region
many were europeans acting much like
today&#39;s mercenaries looking for
adventure and a quick buck unfortunately
what they were mainly looking for were
other human beings to sell into slavery
at first the barbary pirates confined
themselves to the mediterranean basin
this was done out of necessity because
for more than a century the ships that
the barbary pirates traveled in were
galleys you might be familiar with the
in virtually all movies about ancient
greece and rome the ships you see are
powered by slaves rowing their lives
though some of these movies and some
roman galleys did have sales
these were basic square sales
they weren&#39;t the main source of the
ship&#39;s propulsion
they just added speed when the wind was
right for the ancients lacked the
technology and the knowledge to tack
into the wind so likely millions of
human beings around the world toiled
away at the oars by the mid-1500s
many areas of the western mediterranean
coastline of europe were abandoned
the raids of the barbary corsairs
another term for pirate especially those
of the barbary coast had been so
successful in raiding that those left
fled inland for greater protection
one of the most infamous of the barbary
raids took place more than a thousand
miles away on the coast of ireland in
the barbary corsairs landed on the coast
of western ireland
and during the night raided the village
of baltimore taking dozens of slaves
the village remained empty for decades
it would have been foolish for the
pirates to raid the channel coast of
england or look for rich slow-moving
merchant ships there
but english ships trading off the coast
of france and in the mediterranean were
prime targets
in the seven years between 1609 and 1616
the english lost
466 ships to the pirates that is a huge
number it not only shows the size of the
english merchant fleet but the size and
activity of the barbary pirates
and when you stop to consider that
english ships were not the only ones
seized you have a group of very skilled
very rich pirates
before we tell you more about who many
of the slaves were who were taken by the
corsairs let&#39;s stop for a moment and
explain what happened to them
for able-bodied men that were seized a
life of hard labor awaited this could
mean working in various mines along the
barbary coast
which borders the sahara desert you
understand
thirsty work to say the least
other men who knew something about
shipbuilding might be put to work doing
that or many of the other menial tasks
that daily life consisted of at the time
the worst fate for men was to be a
galley slave the life of a galley slave
was most often quite short and extremely
miserable men were placed at the oars
chained to the deck and to the oars and
never allowed to leave
that meant that in addition to rowing
everywhere and often being beaten or
whipped by the crew while doing so
the enslaved rower would take his meals
at the oars and meals likely consisted
of fish remains and rotting vegetables
galley slaves remained at the oars in
all weather they did not have cushions
to sit on
worst of all galley slaves were never
unchained to relieve themselves they did
so at the oars their benches and bodies
became coated with waste until a hard
rain or the crew finally doused them
with water because of the stench
as you can likely imagine the constant
friction of their skin on the oars their
feet on the deck their buttocks and
thighs on the benches meant that the
slaves often had open cuts and or raw
in turn
this meant widespread infection
and death
it also meant gangrene and maggots
eating away at you while you were rowing
and being whipped
though it takes place in roman times the
epic movie ben hur illustrates well the
life of a galley slave
not only was the life of an enslaved
rower miserable it was also at times
filled with terror though by the 1500s
galleys had started to carry smaller
primitive cannons
their existence depended on getting
within grappling distance of their foes
and pulling their ship towards the enemy
all the while the slaves sat and waited
while combat took place around them and
if that was not enough if the ship went
so did the slaves chained to their
people who take slaves are not generally
moral people in the overwhelming number
of cases slavers throughout history took
surrendered and captured enemies raided
lands nearby and or bought slaves of
many different races and ethnicities
slaves had been taken in africa for
untold centuries africans took africans
arabs took africans and when europeans
began to journey to the continent they
took slaves some of them went to europe
but the majority were sent to the
americas where there was no sizable
european workforce
at least not at first the story of
slavery in the united states is a long
and complicated one filled with notions
of racial superiority to justify the
practice of capturing and breeding
millions of people for centuries however
this video is about the pirates and
slaves of the barbary corsairs there are
a number of unusual things about the
barbary pirates they were not just
in their later history many were not
no in addition to the berber captains
were arabs turks dutch greeks and even a
number of cases like that of jack ward
an english barbary pirate in the early
1600s one famous pirate was an arab
muslim woman named saeeda al-her who
became governor of a district of morocco
and was later the wife of its sultan
at a time when muslim religious
tolerance exceeded that of europe even a
small number of jewish men became
one such being synon race who rescued
the son of the most famous barbary
captain jairudine barbarossa
known in the mediterranean from the
english translation redbeard
in 2004 ohio state university history
professor robert c davis published
christian slaves muslim master which
drew notice for its story of how
european slaves made their way into the
slave pens of the barbary coast and the
ottoman empire davis method of
calculating the number of white slaves
taken is mathematically sound though
many have said that his formula only
takes an average number for every year
for more than two centuries by davis
calculations at least 1.5 million
european slaves were taken from the
coastal villages and ships in the
mediterranean basin and as far afield as
ireland as you heard in the case of
men were sent to hard labor in the mines
galleys or the fields women were sorted
by attractiveness and health those
deemed unattractive were made to do work
in the kitchen fields and homes
attractive women and girls were sent to
various important figures for their
harem including for the sultan of
sultans in istanbul
children were often taken and raised as
muslims some of those making their way
into the famous janissaries an ottoman
version of the roman praetorian guard
from the middle 1600s on
various european nations waged war on
the barbary pirates this was done not
only to stop the taking of european
slaves and note the european slavery of
africans continued but to stop the
pirates seizure of important and
valuable commodities such as olive oil
and cotton from egypt
one nation who took particular offense
to the barbary pirates raids was the
united states the united states fought
two wars the first and second barbary
wars to stop the seizure of trade goods
bound for the new nation and to stop the
seizure of american sailors to sell in
the slave markets interestingly enough
the sultan of morocco had been among the
first to recognize the usa and moroccan
pirates were forbidden to attack u.s
the u.s allied with sweden in the second
barbary war 1815 to inflict a heavy
defeat on the pirates and piracy in the
mediterranean went into a rapid decline
though it did continue into the late
19th century
