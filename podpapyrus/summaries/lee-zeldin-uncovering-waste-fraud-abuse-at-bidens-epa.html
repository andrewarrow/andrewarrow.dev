On the operational side, uh it&#39;s there&#39;s
been a lot that we inherited that we
needed to fix. And in the first 100
days, we have put so many of these
wheels back on the bus. And you found
the most incredible talk about waste,
fraud, and abuse. Tell us about this $20
billion climate slush fund which was
funneling money to former or NOS&#39;s run
by former Biden and uh Obama staffers,
people like Stacy Abrams getting
billions of dollars.
When I was going through the
confirmation process, this video comes
out. It was done through Project
Veritass, but it was of a a Biden EPA
who was talking about how the agency was
tossing gold bars off the Titanic,
rushing to get billions of dollars out
the door before inauguration day.
He was also talking about the desire to
get themselves jobs at the recipient
and these members of the Senate. It was
coming from Senate Republicans who were
saying, asking, demanding, if confirmed,
would you please make it a top priority
to quickly get to the bottom of it?
Absolutely was my response with great
enthusiasm and eagerness. And our team
quickly was able to trace down so much.
Basically, every time we overturned a
rock, we found something under it that
was either filled with self-deing and
conflicts of interest, unqualified
recipients, or reduced agency oversight.
And uh when Democrats had one party rule
in Washington DC, they passed this bill
called the Inflation Reduction Act uh
that had tens of billions of dollars to
go out through EPA. Well, EPA didn&#39;t
know how to spend tens of billions of
dollars. So, they decided to park $20
billion at an outside bank and to have
that bank send the money through eight
pass through entities. all these NOS&#39;s
uh passed through entities that were
riddled with self-deing and conflicts of
interest. Former Obama and Biden
officials, Democratic donors, as you
pointed out, and the EPA was a party to
the account control agreement with those
prime recipients. But here&#39;s the thing.
When the money goes through the prime
recipients to others, in many cases also
passroughs, EPA no longer is a party of
the account control agreement. EPA is a
losing oversight. By design,
intentionally, these grant agreements,
these arrangements were set up to tie
EPA&#39;s hands behind its back. I could sit
here with you. You can ask me 10, 15, 20
of the first most important questions
that come to mind as far as where the
money was going after it leaves the
pastor entities. And the crazy thing is
how little I would be able to answer
even today uh this far after
inauguration day. That is by design. Uh
the DOJ has been investigating. The
inspector general&#39;s office has been
investigating. I terminated all of it.
Is there any way of getting the money
Absolutely. Yes. Uh this has been going
through a litigation process. It&#39;s at an
appeals court right now in the federal
court system and uh we are we are
basically at the end of a closeout
period now because when these grants get
terminated there&#39;s a 120day closeout
period and this money should be
recovered for the American public. Uh
and I&#39;m proud to be able to do my part
with this great team here to uh figure
out one where the money went. They
tossed the gold bars off the Titanic. I
was told to go out and find the gold
bars. We found the gold bars and we&#39;re
bringing them back on board and we&#39;re
doing that for the American public and
we&#39;re proud of it.
And are you able to um like find out who
the wrongdoers are and then prosecute
them? Do you think the FBI will be able
to get to the bottom of that?
DOJ and FBI would be uh the ones to
answer any questions as far as
criminality. there was uh by far uh way
too much waste and abuse uh as a a
systemic programmatic issue where we had
to take action quickly which we were
happy to do. Then the cases were
referred to the inspector general&#39;s
office and the DOJ and FBI&#39;s office and
any uh update as far as their
investigations I would have to defer to
them. But our burden on behalf of the
American taxpayer isn&#39;t to prove every
element of a criminal offense beyond a
reasonable doubt. And many in the media
want to say that there&#39;s no evidence of
any waste or abuse. And then every time
I provide more evidence of waste and
abuse, they dig even deeper and saying
there&#39;s no evidence of of waste and
abuse. I just want to give you an
example of, you know, of a couple of
Yeah. You know, we were uh we&#39;re digging
power forward communities. This is an
NGO that you just referenced tied to
Stacy Abrams. Uh this entity received
$100 in 2023. The Biden EPA gave them $2
billion in 2024, put in their grant
agreement a requirement that they needed
to com complete training called how to
develop a budget within 90 days. Right.
So, the Biden EPA said they didn&#39;t know
how to develop a budget and uh yet in
that window they were able to start
spending down the balance even though
the Biden EPA figured that they needed
more training. So, uh this is Biden EPA
reviewers. Quote, &#34;The salary structure
for top officers seems high for
nonprofit or rather high enough that it
merits some explanation. I&#39;m wondering
if this could be a problem with public
perception. And many of the costs are
just presented, but with little or no
explanation as to why they are
reasonable. They&#39;re paying their CEO
$800,000 or COO $450,000.
22 people receiving over $150,000.
And there&#39;s all different kinds of um
complaints, concerns expressed by Biden
EPA officials saying, quote, &#34;Executive
salaries appear excessive.&#34; Another
added that quote, &#34;Senior management
salaries are seemingly high without
justification.&#34; Now, I I could go
a thousand different examples of what
I&#39;m reading right now. Yeah.
And the deeper that I get, the more that
the New York Times and Politico and the
Washington Post will say there&#39;s no
evidence. Well, what do you call
everything that we&#39;re going through?
I&#39;ll give you uh I&#39;ll give you one other
example. Appalachian Community Capital,
one of the NOS&#39;s, uh they received $500
million. In 2023, uh they had spent less
than 4.5 million. Another example of
very small NOS&#39;s, very limited
experience getting large sums of money.
Well, a reviewer, a Biden EPA official,
not a not a Trump political appointee, a
Biden official notes that Appalachian
Community Capital plan to use $215
million to finance 600 zero emission
and $105 million to finance 700 charging
stations. For those at home doing the
math, and this is a quote from the Biden
EPA official, this is $358,333
per EV vehicle, the reviewer wrote.
Adding that $150,000 per charging
station, quote, seems too high,
think now if if you if you said uh you
know that you were going to you were
going to challenge me to spend this
entire interview to continue to go
through additional examples of waste and
abuse. I could actually sit here for the
entire interview and just keep going
through more of this. So why did the I
mean I saw you had that fantastic joust
with a New York Times reporter
actually right here
and and and you&#39;re saying she&#39;s saying
there&#39;s no evidence and you said did you
actually read the judgment and uh she
said we read the judgment turned out she
hadn&#39;t. Um, but that was an example
where you are not afraid to confront uh
whether it&#39;s the media or Sheldon White
House, Adam Schiff, these people in
Congress who kind of talk over you and
pretend that what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re
not saying. Um, just talk us through
your mindset when it comes to just
deciding that you&#39;re not going to back
down. Is that the New York boy in you?
Well, I mean, listen, the good news is
that uh you can edit this out or bleep
it out, but I think that the American
public, they&#39;re fed up with the
And they want people in government to
fight for them to be a good steward of
their tax dollars and they don&#39;t want to
get gaslit by congressional Democrats
and members of the media like the New
York Times and Washington Post and
Politico to lie to them. The fact that
they would dig in deeper in wanting to
demand that we light billions of dollars
on fire
pisses off the American public
and they don&#39;t want us to just sit here
and play nice and tolerate it. If if we
have the facts on our side, why should
we have any amount of apology or regret
for the actions we&#39;re taking on behalf
of the American taxpayer? So, uh I I&#39;ll
give you one example. the uh the left
will use this term called environmental
justice, which if you define it in a
particular way, you could get broad
support. If you want to argue that there
are communities in America that have
been left behind and they have
environmental issues that need to be
remediated,
I I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll find anyone who
disagrees with that point. But here&#39;s
the problem.
Palestine, Ohio, for instance.
Yeah, they&#39;re a great example. there are
a bunch of uh there are a bunch of areas
across America that have environmental
issues that need to get remediated.
So in the name of environmental justice
in the name of that definition that I
just described uh there are people who
will go to Congress to get a dollar
appropriated. Now what are you going to
do with that dollar? the conservative
approach of what you were to do, what
you should do with that dollar is to
directly remediate that environmental
issue that you spoke of to get that
dollar appropriated. What was happening
was the dollar was often times going to
some left-wing activist group
and then that left-wing activist group
will be saying the next dollar that gets
appropriated should get spent on
remediating an environmental issue. Now,
I am not here saying I want to take
money from a left-wing activist group
and give it to a right-wing activist
group. What I am saying is that if a
dollar is appropriated to remediate an
environmental issue, if dollar was spent
in the name of environmental justice and
that&#39;s the definition of it, then the
dollar should get spent directly on
remediating the environmental issue.
Now, in some cases, some of the
environmental justice grants that we
canled, there would be money that would
go to an activist group. they would
spend the money on training another
activist group to come activ to to uh
advocate to Washington for money to that
activist group to go out and be
activists.
So now like just like think through how
that dollar is getting spent. Instead of
the dollar getting spent on remediating
the environmental issue, it was a dollar
to an activist group to train another
activist group to advocate for money for
them to be activists. Uh, one of the the
grants the New York Post has covered uh
is this $50 million that went to a group
called Climate Justice Alliance. And the
Climate Justice Alliance says that
Climate Justice runs through a free
Palestine. And if you ask the average
American where $50 million should get
spent in the name of climate justice or
environmental justice, however the the
left is defining it. the average
American would say, I don&#39;t think that
the money should go towards a group
that&#39;s saying that climate justice is
achieved through a free Palestine. Uh so
it&#39;s just uh it&#39;s just really important
to us personally to fight on behalf of
taxpayers as if every single dollar was
our own.
And I think too often in this town when
someone comes up with an idea of how to
save $10,000, people like, &#34;Man, it&#39;s
only $10,000. It&#39;s not worth it.&#34; Yeah,
it is. Whether it&#39;s a $100,000, a
million dollars, a billion dollars.
There are people in this town who say,
&#34;Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s only a million dollars.
It&#39;s only a billion dollars.&#34; Say like,
&#34;A billion dollars is only 0.003%
of&#34; and they&#39;ll give some larger number.
Well, that&#39;s a billion dollars. Uh our
annual operating budget here at EPA is
about $10 billion. In my first 100 days
as administrator, uh we canled over $22
billion worth of grants.
Wow. and we&#39;re proud of it.
Yeah, good on you. Um, and I mean the
staff of the EPA, I think something like
99% donated to Camela Harris in the 24
presidential campaign. How has it been
trying to come into this organization
that&#39;s so heavily Democrat focused?
We are going to follow our obligations
under the law. We uh inherited an agency
that, as I pointed out during the Biden
administration made a whole lot of bad
decisions. Now, there are some inside
the agency who feel like when the Biden
EPA gets a new rule over the finish
line, if they make a decision on
anything that it&#39;s it should be treated
as etched in stone. It&#39;s a new 11th
commandment. It&#39;s uh it&#39;s gold that is
untouchable. That&#39;s not how it works.
See, if you want something to be
durable, go down the street to Congress
and try to change the law. But inside of
an agency, when an administration comes
in and they come in with their own
policy priorities, uh that agency is
going to, in the case of the Biden
administration, use their powers to try
to suffocate entire industries out of
existence. Now, we&#39;re not going to come
in here and treat all of these decisions
and trillions of dollars of regulation
and extreme economic pain and a lack of
common sense and say, &#34;It&#39;s all etched
in stone because the Biden EPA did it,
so therefore it&#39;s perfect and it should
be here forever.&#34; If you feel like your
idea was that good, go down the street
and try to change the law. But here,
what we&#39;re going to do is heed the
demands of the American public where
they want to be able to afford to heat
their home. They want to be able to
afford a car. People working these jobs
that the Biden EPA was working to put
out of business. We&#39;re going to try to
keep these companies and industries
thriving. We will choose to protect the
environment and grow the economy as I
pointed out earlier. Now, here&#39;s the
good news. Since I came in, I would say
a large majority of the people I have
come in contact with and I meet with
career staff every day, a large majority
of the people I meet with get it. Like
sometimes if you want to spend 20, 30,
40 years in the federal agency, uh
sometimes your candidate will win an
election, sometimes it won&#39;t. Uh
sometimes they won&#39;t. And I mean, my
background is the DoD. I just retired
from the military after 22 years. I I I
signed up to ROC when Bill Clinton was
president and commander-in-chief and
every single time uh whether it was, you
know, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump won,
Biden, that person as a member of the
military was my commander-in-chief and I
will follow all of their lawful orders
as the person who&#39;s head of that chain
of command. Um well in an agency like
EPA a lot of people get that there is
this pendulum that will swing and a lot
of these regulations from Obama to Trump
one to Biden to Trump 2 they&#39;re going to
because of how far the left went to try
to test their powers. Well, Supreme
Court weighed in in a decision called
Loperbrite, and they overturned what&#39;s
called the Chevron Doctrine. And
essentially, they&#39;re telling agencies
that where there is some vague language
in law, an agency can&#39;t just try to
write its own law, say whatever it&#39;s
whatever it wish, do whatever it wishes
with that vague language in law. The
Supreme Court uh really frowns upon
that. Well, we&#39;re going to come in and
we&#39;re going to get it right. We&#39;re
trying to fix as much as we can and
we&#39;re going to try to do it all in the
first year or so of us being here
because the American public demands it.
So most of the agency understands that
this is what should be expected.
They under they understand that the
American public spoke last November.
President Trump is the president. We are
here to implement policies and that
regulations will get um reconsidered.
And I guess I mean the EPA under Biden
and also under Obama was really focused
mainly on climate change. Uh and when
Donald Trump came in, he uh pulled us
out of the Paris climate accord. Uh, and
you are now, it seems, trying to orient
the agency more towards clean air, um,
clean water, what the average American
would think of as pollution, as
environmental, uh, causes rather than
some airy fairy idea of, um, you know,
climate. Is that is that a correct
reading of what you&#39;re doing?
The first pillar of powering the great
American comeback at the Trump EPA is
clean air, land, and water for all
Americans. Uh, President Trump has often
spoke about it spoken about it as a top
priority of his. So therefore, it&#39;s a
top priority of ours. On the 100th day
of President Trump&#39;s time in office, we
put out a press release that was talking
about 100 environmental actions that the
Trump EPA took in the first 100 days of
this Trump term in office. And we&#39;re
very proud of that press release. And it
was decisions that we made, everything
from responding to the LA wildfires to
water quality standards in southeast
Pennsylvania and so much more. Uh
removing contaminated soil, the list
goes on. We&#39;re proud of this effort.
Clean air, land, and water for all
Americans. Now, the Biden EPA, as I
pointed out, would say you can only
uh protect the environment. It&#39;s
impossible to protect the environment
without destroying the economy. It It&#39;s
a a wild concept that we don&#39;t accept.
You mean by like stopping drilling in in
Alaska and places?
Yeah. And they were trying to close down
all sorts of different base load power.
And you have many uh who talk about many
on the left who talk about wind for
example which is an intermittent source
of energy as if that is the substitute
we&#39;ve been waiting for for base load
power. Well, I want to see America
become the AI capital of the world.
President Trump has been working hard to
make America the AI capital of the
But you need a lot of energy for that.
You need a lot of energy for that. And
you can&#39;t be suffocating all that base
load power and then saying, &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re
just going to base as in coal mainly and
coal and gas and and nuclear and there
are so many different forms of base load
power uh in this country and President
Trump wants to build new pipelines
you know I came from a state I&#39;m still a
New Yorker where there there have been
decisions where they won&#39;t allow a safe
extraction of natural gas they won&#39;t
allow gas hookups on new construction
