So, Mitzer Nasios again, would you
consider yourself liberal or woke in any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, great. Do you believe that USAD is
a criminal agency plagued by waste,
fraud, and abuse?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And on February 4th, nearly the entire
US ID workforce was notified that they
were being placed on administrative
leave. Mr. Natios, would you say that
removing the majority of the staff
responsible for overseeing USAD&#39;s
programs increases or decreases the risk
of waste, fraud, and abuse? Well, it
increases it because the oversight of
aid, aid officers are there for
oversight. That&#39;s what they do. 40% of
the staff of aid are compliance
officers. They spend all day trying to
make sure these things don&#39;t happen.
They do happen sometimes because of
where we work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And um the USAD inspector general agreed
with you uh as the ranking member uh
entered into the record stated that all
of USAD&#39;s oversight controls are largely
nonoperational.
But instead of addressing this problem,
Trump actually fired the inspector
general who released this report the
very next day. Mr. Natios, does firing
USAD&#39;s inspector general generally
reduce or increase waste, fraud, and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, uh, Congresswoman, I&#39;m trying to
stay out of the uh the vitriol here, but
uh the inspector general is there to
investigate
abuse. And let me tell you how it works.
People think that they watch us and then
they find this stuff and then they
arrest us. And that&#39;s not how it works.
The 80% of the investigations done by
aid are initiated by aid compliance
officers who call the IG and say there&#39;s
a problem. You need to come in here and
fix it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They want to encourage women to have
abortions. And what is an abortion, Mr.
Speaker? It&#39;s killing babies. I&#39;ve said
it on the floor before. The word
abortion sounds so clinical, so clean,
but we need to say what it is. It is
killing babies up to the point of their
birth. This is not an extreme piece of
legislation. It is a sensible piece of
legislation and every person in this
body should vote for it. If you care
about life, if you don&#39;t care about
life, if all you want to d do is destroy
life, then vote no. That&#39;s the radical
side. We&#39;re not the radical people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can&#39;t help but chuckle at the
ridiculous arguments coming from the
other side of the aisle. Because while
I&#39;ll admit that my Republican colleagues
are good at naming bills, they are not
good at caring for parents or kids after
they&#39;re born. This so-called pregnant
students rights act ironically fails to
give pre students any new rights. It
gives them no meaningful information or
support like campus child care, family
housing, or nutrition support if they
choose to be pregnant or parent while in
school. Instead, it provides a biased
slate of options that push students to
keep their pregnancy and raise a child
with no mention of contraception or that
seeking an abortion is a viable and
valid choice. Whereas on November 1st,
2023, during a speech on the House
floor, Representative Ma Brian Mass
stated that quote, &#34;There are very few
innocent Palestinian civilians.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I would encourage the other side to not
so lightly throw around the idea of
innocent Palestinian civilians, as is
frequently said. Uh I don&#39;t think we
would so lightly throw around the term
innocent Nazi civilians during World War
II. I would ask that it be looked at
through that lens that uh you know
there&#39;s there&#39;s not this far stretch to
say there are very few innocent
Palestinian civilians. I haven&#39;t seen
the videos of the innocent Palestinian
civilians that were out there trying to
protect the Israelis that were out there
trying to stop the attacks trying to get
the the the captives returned instead of
being taken into tunnel systems.
Representative Brian Mass comments
regarding innocent Palestinian civilians
in Gaza are dehumanizing, inflammatory,
unacceptable, and can be reasonably
construed as inviting the targeted
murder of innocent Palestinians, fanning
the flames of violence in the Middle
East, and violating the international
rules of war. Now, therefore, be it
resolved that Brian Mast be censured.
Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 21 of
Rule 9, I rise to give notice of my
intention to raise a question of the
privileges of the House. The form of the
resolution is as follows. House
resolution 846 censing representative
Brian Mast.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Under rule 9, a resol
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whereas representative Brian Mast served
honorably in the United States Army with
distinct sacrifice, dedication, and
bravery. Whereas, Representative Brian
Mast has repeatedly made inflammatory
statements regarding innocent
Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are in
harm&#39;s way through no fault of their own
as a result of horrific terrorist
attacks conducted by Hamas on October
7th, 2023.
Whereas, Representative Brian Mast&#39;s
refusal to distinguish innocent
Palestinians from Hamas terrorists is
false, misleading, dehumanizing,
dangerous, and unbecoming of a member of
Whereas on October 19th, 2023, during a
House Foreign Affairs Committee markup,
Representative Brian Mast emphatically
inserted asserted that any urgently
needed humanitarian aid for innocent
Palestinian civilians who are in harm&#39;s
way through no fault of their own should
quote be slowed down and that there
should be quote every effort to made to
slow down any perceived assistance.
Because I would challenge anybody in
here to mo to to point to me which
Palestinian
is Hamas and which one is an innocent
Which is the one the the child that was
poking the Israeli children? The ch the
children that were poking other Israeli
children. And which ones exactly are the
innocent ones? which are the ones that
were standing by somewhere along the
border saying, &#34;No, turn around. No,
return that person. No, don&#39;t take that
person hostage. No, don&#39;t conduct that
rape, that murder, that beheading, that
whatever.&#34;
It should absolutely
be every effort made to slow down
any perceived assistance that&#39;s going
there and
to perhaps bring in equivalencies in
some part have the conversation of would
this be something we would talk about
immediately following Pearl Harbor or
immediately following 911. Whereas on
October 19th, 2023, during the same
House Foreign Affairs Committee markup,
Representative Brian Mast stated that
terrorism is, and I quote, absolutely
supported by the Palestinian people from
elementary school all the way up into
the elderly.
Whereas on November 1st, 2023, during a
speech on the House floor,
Representative Brian Mast inexcusably,
the House will be in order.
Gentleoman is recognized.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whereas on November 1st, 2023, during a
speech on the House floor,
Representative Brian Mast inexcusably
compared innocent Palestinian civilians,
including children, who are often used
as human shields by Hamas terrorists, to
Nazi collaborators that perpetrated the
Holocaust against the Jewish people.
Whereas the horrific crime against
humanity perpetrated by Nazis that
resulted in the murder of more than six
million Jews during the Holocaust should
never be trivialized. Whereas on
November 2nd, 2023, Representative Brian
Mast again incorrectly conflated
innocent Palestinian civilians with
Hamas terrorists by tweeting a video of
of a Hamas leader and asserting that I
quote again, &#34;A two-state solution means
making a state out of these murderous
terrorists who are openly calling for
the atrocities of October 7th to be
committed over and over again.&#34;
Whereas, Representative Brian Mass&#39;s
repeated conflation of innocent
Palestinian civilians with Hamas
terrorists sends a message to the world
that violence against all Palestinians
is legitimate and risks the incitement
of brutal attacks across the Middle East
region, including settler violence in
the West Bank and Hezbollah aggression
in northern Israel. Whereas instances of
anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia have
been on the rise, including the
hatefueled murder of Wadia El Faumi, a
six-year-old Palestinian American who
was stabbed to death in his home in
Illinois on October 15th, 2023 because
of his identity. And whereas
Representative Brian Mass&#39;s comments
regarding innocent Palestinian civilians
in Gaza are dehumanizing, inflammatory,
unacceptable, and can be reasonably
construed as inviting the targeted
murder of innocent Palestinians, fanning
the flames of violence in the Middle
East, and violating the international
rules of war. Now, therefore, be it
resolved that Brian Mask be censured.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m a gasast. I am just a gasast at how
this bill is being characterized.
It&#39;s being called an extreme piece of
legislation.
We want pregnant students to be
supported on their campuses and to know
that they can be supported.
It is has nothing to do with
criminalizing abortions.
It has nothing to do with a nationwide
abortion ban. Our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle say something
about healthy babies. What is better
than the we need pregnant women to have
good resources and good health care so
they can have healthy babies
but they want what they call
comprehensive information to women.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We are just a few days from what would
have been the anniversary of Roie Wade.
So, it&#39;s sadly predictable that we&#39;re
here debating MAGA Republicans bill that
would stigmatize students who parent
while in school or seek abortion care.
Pregnant and parenting students deserve
comprehensive information about their
rights and the resources and support
they need to thrive at school. What they
don&#39;t need is lectures about their
choices. They don&#39;t need obstacles to
accessing abortion and the full spectrum
of healthcare. and they certainly don&#39;t
need this condescending legislation
that&#39;s more interested in advancing an
anti-abortion agenda than genuinely
helping students.
The decisions about keeping a pregnancy
to term and raising a child are serious,
private, and personal. Women denied an
abortion are four times more likely to
live below the federal poverty line.
They&#39;re more likely to be evicted, go
bankrupt, and have debt. They&#39;re more
likely to stay in contact with a violent
partner and raise the resulting child
alone. and their children&#39;s financial
well-being and development are more
likely to suffer too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And now recognize the representative
from California, Miss Jacobs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, first of
all, uh, a question for my colleagues. I
know all of us probably remember Ebola
from the 2014 outbreak that President
Trump, a private citizen at the time,
was particularly outspoken about and
terrified of. For those of you who don&#39;t
remember, Ebola is a disease that has
about a 41% fatality rate. No vaccine,
no treatment. Uh it it causes vomiting,
muscle pain, and hemorrhagic bleeding.
Pretty bad. Uh I&#39;d like all of my
colleagues, please raise your hand if
you would like Ebola in the United
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you say your question again?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Would you like Ebola in the United
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m glad the Trump administration
approved Ebola response in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on that point. Um, with uh I ask for
unanimous consent to enter into the
record a New York Times article,
life-saving aid remains halted worldwide
despite Rubio&#39;s promise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So ordered, but it&#39;s not if you want to
see the list.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And um on Tuesday, Elon Musk, the
billionaire tech entrepreneur empowered
by President Trump to combat the agency,
I&#39;m quoting the article now, told
reporters in the Oval Office that the
administration had turned on funding for
Ebola prevention and for HIV prevention.
But in reality, again quoting this
article, the Ebola funding and virtually
all of the HIV prevention funding
remains frozen according to USAD
employees and several aid groups. And
that is because the payment system
called Phoenix that USAD relies on to
disperse financial assistance has been
inaccessible for weeks. Um so as uh you
may know um Mr. Nazios. Um the outbreak
of of diseases, infectious diseases is
one of the big things that USAD helps to
prevent. Um which is why I think we all
should be so horrified that because of
Elon Musk&#39;s illegal takeover of USAD,
USAD is no longer able to screen
travelers at airports leaving Uganda
where there is currently an Ebola
outbreak that Americans have already
been infected by. Mr. Natios, you led
USAD, correct?
Do you think stopping the screening of
travelers makes America more or less
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It makes us less safe. But I would add
that there is over the last 30 years,
we&#39;ve built a a system in 90 southern
countries for monitoring all infectious
diseases and that&#39;s the early warning
system. So if an outbreak of any disease
takes place, we know about it. the
countries where like China where uh co
started there&#39;s I&#39;m not I certainly
wouldn&#39;t advocate being an having an aid
mission there but the countries where
there&#39;s an aid mission the ministries of
health have been trained and there&#39;s a a
comprehensive um early warning system to
protect us that system is uh in in terms
of aid support for it has been shut down
that&#39;s right I might also add
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sorry I ju I just want to reclaim my
time because I have a few more questions
but I completely agree with you so Let&#39;s
take my Republican colleagues at your
word. You want to reduce waste, fraud,
and abuse. I agree with that. You want
to reform how USAD does its work. I
agree with that, too. In fact, I have
bipartisan legislation to do that that
I&#39;m happy to work with you, Mr. Mast on.
Just to clarify, not only is this freeze
endangering Americans, but Trump and
Musk&#39;s argument for stopping this
assistance to reduce waste, fraud, and
abuse is a complete lie because they are
doing the opposite. That&#39;s because this
is not about oversight. It&#39;s not about
reform. It&#39;s about completely gutting
foreign assistance itself. With that,
