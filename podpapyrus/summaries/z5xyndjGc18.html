This is Trevor May. He played nine years
of Major League Baseball and has been
clocked at over 100 mph. Today, Trevor
is going undercover against a team of
high schoolers. We told the 17U team
that I&#39;m going to pitch against them for
some free gear. So, they&#39;re expecting
nothing more than an average pitcher.
And the rules are going to be pretty
simple. If you get a hit off me, you win
$500 of free gear. But what they don&#39;t
know is I&#39;m going to make a call to the
bullpen and absolutely blow their minds.
Are you ready to go?
There&#39;s only one way to find out. So,
this is where our day began. All right,
guys. We just got to the field. The
players are warming up behind us.
They&#39;re doing practice back there. So,
obviously, we&#39;ll be doing live ABS to
see who wins what. But I&#39;ll go through
the gear real quick. So, we have four of
the brand new 2026 Rawlings icons. These
go for like 400 450 bucks. So, we have
four of these to give away. And these
literally just dropped. So, these are
like brand new bats. And of course, who
doesn&#39;t love Bruce Bolt? So, I have four
different types of Bruce Bolts as well.
These are like probably the most popular
Bruce Bolts of all time. So, we have
four Bruce Bolts, four Rawlings bats.
Okay, so here is the official game plan
for today. Trevor is currently driving
to the field. So, in the meantime, I&#39;m
going to be warming up and acting like
I&#39;m the only pitcher who&#39;s going to be
throwing today. While that&#39;s going on,
Trevor is going to suit up in his full
Oakland A&#39;s uniform, far away from the
field so nobody can see him. He&#39;s going
to do his full warm-up routine. So, by
the time I face my first batter, he&#39;ll
be ready to be my reliever, throwing
well over 90 m an hour with some nasty
off speed, leaving these kids
speechless. So, what&#39;s cool is Trevor
retired last season, but he&#39;s been
training this offseason for fun to try
to get back up to 100 miles an hour. I&#39;m
not sure what his velocity will be
but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be faster than
anything these guys have ever faced,
which would be hilarious to see their
reactions. I&#39;ll explain the rest of the
scoring system once we get to the field.
But with that, it&#39;s almost go time. You
got to get ready. Got to bring the stuff
over. So, let&#39;s go.
Leo, tell us about this team.
Okay, so my old pitching coach, he
started a travel team. It&#39;s called Top
Level. These kids are like 16, 17 years
old. So, I mean, they should be capable.
I got to be quiet cuz some of them are
lurking. They should be capable to make
contact, but it&#39;s going to be a
challenge for sure.
I expect one of the kids to get a cheeky
hit. You&#39;re giving up a hit and Trevor
will give up a hit.
Oh, they&#39;re in like full uniform and
stuff, too. They&#39;re ready to play. This
is the coach.
What&#39;s up, Coach Zack?
How&#39;s it going, guys? Great, man.
Excited to do some good work today.
Trevor&#39;s going to be here in 10 minutes,
And then, uh, I&#39;ll be on left field with
Trevor and one of our videographers, and
then Dan or Tony will text me when like
that one batter is over and to queue him
in, and then he&#39;ll come running in.
It&#39;s a lot going on right now. I really
hope it works out. I&#39;ll explain what is
going to happen now that we talked to
coach Zach.
Okay, so Trevor just got here. Leo and
Brian, our videographer, are going back
there to meet with him.
This is Brian, man.
It still fits kind of.
So, the legend has arrived. Trevor May
is here. But, uh, break us down the
Uh, yeah, you might have to blur this
Oakland out. We know that&#39;s not okay
now. The Carrie Greens, my favorite uni
I had. And honestly, it&#39;s the only one
that I have complete. I was trying to go
with the the Mets black jerseys, but
it&#39;s in a frame and I forgot. So that&#39;s
on me. That&#39;s on me. This is the Mets
Okay. Like we said, we have 15 minutes
until Trevor&#39;s going to get on the
mound. So, let&#39;s go get warm.
Yeah, we got to get warm.
So, we sent him back there so none of
the kids would have any idea. And now
I&#39;m going to get warmed up and get ready
to go. So, we got to put on my cleat and
they&#39;re, you know, again, thinking just,
hey, I&#39;m going to throw live AB to them
for some prizes. It&#39;ll be fun. So, I
think it&#39;s coming together. It&#39;ll be
fine. I&#39;m a little nervous that this
isn&#39;t going to work out, but I think
it&#39;s going to work out. So, okay. I&#39;m
going to get my cleats on now. Let&#39;s go.
So the plan is the fields are back are
blocked over here for some reason.
This is what we&#39;re working with guys.
Anything remotely flat anywhere?
Uh not the road. Not the throw but like
even just jocks like it&#39;s crazy that the
field is the only flat part.
And uh so Trevor&#39;s going to get loose
just like get the body ready and then
we&#39;re going to do like the big intro
with him at 12:35 I guess. Whenever
you&#39;re ready, he&#39;ll just get warm on the
field after we intro him. Yeah, he&#39;s
going to warm up.
Okay, I&#39;m still throwing right now, so
we&#39;re good. Okay.
You got to be very careful cuz these
kids are like so excited. They know
Dan&#39;s coming, so they know something&#39;s
Also, I&#39;m very noticeable.
this is not one of those camouflage
greens. This is uh you&#39;re supposed to
see it. All right. Normal normal routine
as far as I can remember.
One thing they don&#39;t tell you to when
you get older and put on weight, your
head gets bigger. This hat barely fits.
So tell me, I don&#39;t know anything about
this team.
Who are these kids?
Basically, 17 new travel baseball. D2,
D1, D3 commits. They&#39;re going to
actually lose their mind when they see
this guy take the mounds. How many
batters do we have today?
I I&#39;ll push for four.
Yeah. Really trying to balance the fun
and the content with the hurting
I just I know I&#39;m going to be I&#39;m going
to get really competitive, bro. I just I
just am. I&#39;m getting a little nervous.
Which is hilarious to me.
Did you get nervous in real MLB games?
every time. Like
first spring training game too was
always the most cuz you&#39;re like am I
good anymore? Like what&#39;s how&#39;s this
going to go?
Make sure when look towards the outfield
once I&#39;m done throwing. Okay.
Get pictures of there&#39;s some going to be
someone coming. So just be ready for
that. Don&#39;t tell anyone but just make
sure to get those pictures.
We&#39;re about 5 10 minutes away from live.
We have like four batters that you&#39;re
scheduled to hopefully do. Potential
stat line. So, if I hit four guys or hit
four guys, the cocky side of me wants to
be these 4Ks, but uh I&#39;m also not
confident in my ability to throw that
many strikes. So, I&#39;m going to give
myself a strike out, a walk, a pop out,
and a ground out. See what happens. I&#39;ve
been throwing breaking balls for like 4
days. So, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m even going
to try to try a slider, but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll
see. I I mean,
Trevor and Leo are warming up back there
somewhere. You guys have seen that. I
haven&#39;t seen it, but you guys are I&#39;m
probably cutting in the footage here and
there. So, you see the guys do not know
about anything right now. You kind of
see the prizes right there. So, I&#39;m
going to bring them all together. Then
we&#39;re going to talk about the prizes for
today. How you feeling right now?
I&#39;m feeling really good. And I think
you&#39;re going to feel really good when
the the relief guy comes in.
My arm actually hurts. I do need a
reliever like right now, but I&#39;m going
to throw a little bit and just get grit
through it. What&#39;s up, guys? So, I&#39;m
going to be doing live ABS today against
you guys. This is what we&#39;re going to
do. We have all these prizes right
there. We have 2026 icons and then four
pairs of Bruce Bolts. And if you make
contact in play, just contact in play,
not a bunt, but like actual swing and
contact in play, you win a bat. Okay?
And then if you get an actual hit, like
we decide, okay, that was an actual hit
in play, you win a bat and Bruce Bolts
that you can give away to a teammate.
So batting today will be the older guys,
okay? It&#39;s randomized by chat GPT, so
don&#39;t get mad at me. All right, Smith
batting second, Gara. Third, Miller.
Fifth, Stutler. Sixth, Para. Seven,
Leaporta. Eight, Stokovich. Nine,
Graves. 10, Berwin. And if we get to it,
11, Anthony. All right.
Ready? Let&#39;s go. All right. I&#39;m going to
warm up now. Uh, and then we&#39;re going to
get started. So, let&#39;s go. See, it&#39;s
funny because they&#39;re going to see me
throw. It&#39;s going to be like low 80s.
He&#39;s going to be like, I could get a
hit. I could put a ball in play. That&#39;s
where the surprise comes in.
Oh, sorry.
Hey, he&#39;s a
We need another screen. We need another
He&#39;s a crafty lefty.
That&#39;s a warning shot. I&#39;m just really
excited about these prizes.
Like, I might just throw like five going
through motion on top of the mountain
standing up. I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m throwing
to the their catcher. I don&#39;t have I
don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to have any issue
catching me. A 14-year-old caught me
recently. So, we&#39;ll see. I will try.
Wait, so if you if you get the ball in
the out or anywhere, even if you get a
if it&#39;s just contacting play,
we got a real If you get a hit, you get
you get batting gloves and the
Oh, we got the gear. Yellow. Yellow.
Come on, baby.
Here we go.
Come on, baby. Start it off.
Dang, man. That&#39;s a
That&#39;s a bat right there. He just won a
single already.
You&#39;ll you have a single?
Here you go, bro.
This is for you.
Appreciate it.
Brand new icon. And then you won for a
teammate from Bruce Bolt as well. So,
you want to get one of your hook one of
your teammates up maybe who&#39;s not
Yes, sir. Thank you, boys.
Yeah, of course. Nice hit, bro. All
right. It&#39;s a hit. Okay. I mean, that&#39;s
kind of what I expected to happen.
Leis like they&#39;re he&#39;s ready when you&#39;re
ready type of thing.
Yeah, we&#39;re ready whenever.
You want to just run it?
Yeah, let&#39;s just run.
Let&#39;s do it.
Running whenever.
All right, so Dan is done. It&#39;s time to
queue in Trevor coming in to relieve
some 17-year-old kids. and he&#39;s going to
Hey boys, you know, my arm&#39;s actually
not feeling really good. A little sore.
Uh so, you know, I think I&#39;m going to
bring in a reliever. It&#39;s a guy out
there who&#39;s going to come in and uh
pitch instead.
Oh, boy.
This guy. Oh, I know him.
Yo, I&#39;ve seen it.
What the hell is this?
Is the only road behind you right now?
Let&#39;s go, baby.
What&#39;s up, dude? Thanks for coming.
Appreciate you. My arms really sore.
I know. You look good. Hey, still fit.
Still fits. How you feeling?
Good, man.
Yeah, excited.
I think I&#39;m excited, too. So, I threw
one. He got a hit off me. Won a bat,
unfortunately. So, I I needed a reliever
to come in. This is our guy right here.
So, what&#39;s the plan? And you want to
warm up a little or
Yeah. Throw a little bit.
I don&#39;t know, like to 90 ft.
Oh, and the Oh, here&#39;s the scoring
system. So, if they make contact with
you in play, like fair territory, I&#39;m
going to give them a bat. So, I need
your help there to kind of protect that.
And if they get an actual hit, like a
real life hit, they get a pair of gloves
and a bat. Not on the line, but
Well, and my entire reputation and pride
Yeah, these kids are what 16, 17 years
old. Okay. Yeah.
I mean, they&#39;re the future.
They&#39;re the future wash.
Surprisingly sharp.
First impressions of Trevor Man. What do

Um, but yeah, he&#39;s doing a road to 100

end of the World Series.
