My channel will get taken down with my
2,000 videos. Look at this. These are
all copyright claims.
It looks to me like Rick Bott was
targeted. These companies have their
guys. They&#39;re not attorneys, but that
sit there at their desks all day long
and they seek out to find content fair
use. Universal doesn&#39;t want you to use
it song. Universal doesn&#39;t get a say.
So Rick Auto just released a new video
entitled, &#34;This record label is trying
to silence me.&#34; And I have never seen
him this fed up. and I understand why.
I&#39;m an entertainment attorney of over 11
years. I represent clients who have big
YouTube channels just like Rick. So,
let&#39;s jump into it and see what&#39;s going
What&#39;s up, everyone? I hate making these
videos, but I really need to because it
seems like the only thing that ever gets
done is when you talk about this stuff.
UMG Universal Music Group has continued
to send emails about copyright content
ID claims and now copyright strikes on
my channel. As a matter of fact, I have
three shorts. Okay, these are under a
minute long that if they go through in
the next 4 days, I&#39;ll have three strikes
on my channel.
And the reason that matters is if you
get three strikes on your channel, your
channel gets deleted. I believe at this
point Rick has something like 5 million
subscribers on his YouTube channel. So,
this is a life ordeath situation for his
channel. Rick&#39;s been very vocal about
the challenges with these major record
labels who are putting claims on his
videos. I&#39;ve talked about this with
other big creators such as with Knox
Hill and I&#39;ve been going to bat with
these major record labels and I can tell
you that what the major labels have said
in these closed door meetings to me is
nothing short of shocking. But let&#39;s go
back to Rick. If you don&#39;t fight these
things, those three strikes would
actually remove my channel from YouTube.
The first one is here. It&#39;s an Adam
Duritz video. It&#39;s a short and it&#39;s
using the song Sixth Avenue Heartache.
You sang the harmony part on Sixth
Avenue Heartache.
Oh yeah.
If you want to know how much money this
is over, that one video, the Sixth
Avenue Heartache one, made $36.52
with its 250,000 views. So, they&#39;re
going to take my channel down over less
than a hundred bucks for using a small
segment from an interview with him on a
song he sang on.
Now, guys, context on this matters. When
we&#39;re talking about educators like Rick
Bott, when we&#39;re talking about reaction
channels where someone is sitting there
and they&#39;re like, &#34;Hey, this new song by
this famous artist came out. I&#39;m sitting
there. I&#39;m dissecting it. I&#39;m talking
about the lyrics.&#34; Or in Rick&#39;s case,
he&#39;s talking about the composition of
the song, the career of the artist,
right? He&#39;s doing something that is
educational. So that is typically going
to qualify for something called fair
use. If it&#39;s fair use, that means you
get to use someone else&#39;s copyrighted
stuff without their permission. So
meaning if you&#39;re using a song that
belongs to Universal, even if Universal
doesn&#39;t want you to use it song, if what
you&#39;re doing qualifies as fair use,
Universal doesn&#39;t get a say.
That video is 55 seconds long. The next
one has me in it. It&#39;s an Olivia Rodrigo
song that I played maybe 10 seconds of
the song on. And the short is 42 seconds
long. Who did it? Universal Music Group.
The third copyright strike is from a Han
Zimmer short. It&#39;s also UMG. It&#39;s from
the Crimson Tide soundtrack. Now, what
do these things say? It says, &#34;What
happened? Your video is scheduled to be
removed in 4 days and your channel will
get a copyright strike due to removal
request from a claimant.&#34; The claimment
is Universal Music Group, UMG. If you
delete your video before then your
channel won&#39;t get a copyright strike.
Just today I open up my email and if you
look at this, these are all copyright
claims that just came in or content ID
claims. So they start at 104 and then
the next one&#39;s at 104 p.m. the next
one&#39;s at 104, then 1:18 p.m. then 1:33
Let me say this because um some of these
companies, they come back and they&#39;re
like, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s our automated system,
right? we are in Content ID. And so it&#39;s
YouTube&#39;s automated system that is
putting the claims on these videos. And
I&#39;m kind of calling BS on that. I know
for a fact these companies have their
guys, they&#39;re not attorneys, but they
have their guys that sit there at their
desks all day long and they seek out,
they watch the videos to find content
that belongs to, let&#39;s say, Universal.
They then file their claims. And let me
be clear on this. Normally the claim is
they want to monetize the video. If you
guys remember, Rick used to talk about
this. He goes, &#34;I didn&#39;t used to fight
the claims, right? If another label came
along and claimed my video, even though
I have the right to keep the
monetization because I am transforming
the song into a new thing because I&#39;m
doing an educational video, I don&#39;t want
to fight, so I&#39;m just going to let it
go.&#34; And then more recently, he&#39;s been
like, &#34;Uh, no.&#34; For the thousands of
claims that he has gotten on his videos,
he started to push back, which is his
legal right. And so from what he&#39;s
showing that there&#39;s just one after
another claim from Universal, it looks
to me like Rick Bott was targeted.
Then 2:01 p.m. 2:16 p.m. 218 p.m. 2:20
p.m. 2:21 p.m. 229 p.m. 2:30 2:32. Those
emails are all in a row. That&#39;s how many
I got just between 1:30 and 2:30. All
those content ID claims from videos that
are all fair use. Now, I mentioned this
a few weeks ago when I made the video
when I was talking about the professor
of rock and his challenges with
copyright content ID claims, uh, threats
to strike your channel and take it down,
things like that. And it continues to
happen. And I&#39;ve hired a lawyer
because it takes it&#39;s a full-time job.
I&#39;ve had probably 4,000
claims over the last nine years from
things that are fair use where I&#39;m
discussing songs. I&#39;m doing interviews
with people where I&#39;m playing the music
that they either wrote and recorded or
they produced.
I I I finally broke with this. At first,
I was like, &#34;Okay, forget about it. I
won&#39;t do it.&#34; And then I did a Rick
Rubin interview and it had 13 copyright
claims in the video. That&#39;s when I hired
a lawyer to fight these.
What I can also tell you guys is that
usually there are non- lawyers that are
filing the claims. So then that requires
Rick Bott or you other YouTube content
creators to go and call your lawyer to
help you with the counter notification
because it&#39;s pretty scary if you&#39;re
going to fight these and it escalates.
They&#39;re like, &#34;Hey, if you do an
official counter notification or an
appeal, in other words, like under the
penalty of perjury.&#34; I mean, there&#39;s all
kinds of warnings before you actually
say, &#34;No, this is fair use. I believe
that to be the case.&#34; But in any
instance, this is what happens. You
fight back. Let&#39;s say on that first
pass, which is just someone&#39;s trying to
claim your monetization. You go, &#34;No,
you don&#39;t get to claim it.&#34; And then
it&#39;s up to the claimants whether they&#39;re
going to escalate it. So, with these
labels, what we&#39;ve been seeing that they
do, if you try fighting them, they get
upset and that&#39;s when this thing starts
to escalate to then a strike. And it&#39;s
really unfortunate that there&#39;s only
three strikes because it puts you in a
very disadvantaged position when you
just received, I don&#39;t know, two dozen
claims on your videos. And so for some
of these companies, after it does
escalate and they get a counter
notification, they have one of their
lawyers look at it. But that lawyer&#39;s
opinion doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually the
case. And I have had situations where
someone came back and they&#39;re like, &#34;Oh,
no. Our lawyer looked at it, but
actually our parillegal looked at it and
said they didn&#39;t think it was a very
good video.&#34; And so it gets difficult
because that&#39;s a super subjective. You
just personally didn&#39;t like the video.
That&#39;s not the law and that&#39;s not the
analysis for fair use.
And what he&#39;s done is he fought every
single claim. And there&#39;s many of my
interviews which are all fair use that
have multiple songs in them. When I
interviewed Daniel Lanois, there were so
many songs in it. Brendan O&#39;Brien, all
these producers that I interview and
forget about the artists that I
interview where I play their music and
we talk about it. You need to play
people&#39;s music to talk about it. That is
the definition of fair use. These are
interviews with the people about their
careers. Now, why are these record
wanting to take down content about
artists that have records on their
label? What sense does that make? Well,
you might say, &#34;Well, they don&#39;t own
their own uh they don&#39;t own their own
songs. They don&#39;t own their own
publishing. They they sold it.&#34; No, this
is actually the sound recordings that
are in here. So, it is literally
Universal Music Group because they own
the sound recordings.
And I can actually answer that. What
they say is that you are devaluing their
sound recordings, their music by playing
it on your big show, your big fancy
show, because it&#39;s taking away from
people going and listening to the music
elsewhere. And my push back to that is
always that is silly. That doesn&#39;t even
make sense. Having an opportunity to
have your song played on Rick Biato is
going to get significant exposure and
hopefully interest from a brand new
generation.
Yes, some of the content ID claims come
from the publishers as well. So
sometimes I&#39;ll get two different claims.
It&#39;s I don&#39;t even understand how this
works honestly. But we have successfully
fought thousands of these now. But it
literally cost me so much money to do
this. Since we&#39;ve been fighting these
things and never lost one, they still
keep coming in. I mean, it&#39;s ridiculous.
What do I have to do here? I&#39;m sorry to
come on and complain, but Universal,
it&#39;s honestly, they&#39;re all Universal
Music Group. So, they obviously have
hired some third-party company that are
dredging up things. They&#39;re looking for
things that haven&#39;t been claimed in the
past. They&#39;re taking videos from seven,
eight years ago. Give it a rest. My god.
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a third party
company involved here. I think it&#39;s
internal. And I&#39;m telling you, for all
my big content creators across the
board, it is universal that is doing
Now, if I didn&#39;t fight these three
claims, my channel will get taken down
with my 2,000 videos.
Is that ridiculous? It&#39;s ridiculous to
me. And they&#39;re for interviews.
It&#39;s ridiculous.
The general increase in aggression by
Universal is not only something that I&#39;m
noticing, but the volume at which they
are filing these claims on channels that
are again reaction channels, educational
channels. And I don&#39;t know if what
they&#39;re trying to do is to get everyone
to just stop reacting to songs that
Universal owns or maybe it&#39;s going to
become just so unbelievably difficult
for these YouTubers to be able to run
their channels that they&#39;re going to
cave and just let Universal collect the
monetization regardless of the fact that
it&#39;s not entitled to under the law. Or
maybe Universal is just going to turn
around and say, &#34;You know what? You
should just get a license from us.&#34; When
again, one was not required to begin
with. I&#39;m definitely sorry that our
YouTube content creator community is
dealing with this. Let me know what you
think in the comments down below. I&#39;m
