nobody leaves here until you hand me an
idea that I can Shock the World with in
a few days time you are all selfish
mother let&#39;s talk about Finance lessons
from the fifth episode of billion season
2 based on my work experience at Goldman
Sachs New York City and based on my work
experience at the top hedge funds in the
world now please like comment and
subscribe and stick around because at
the end of this video I&#39;m going to grade
the episode for Wall Street really ISM
with a buy hold or sell rating now in
this video we&#39;re going to talk about two
different topics topic one is why day
trading does not work and during topic
one we will discuss exactly how the most
successful hedge funds make money by
thinking longer term and we&#39;ll also talk
about their research process which you
can easily learn and then in topic two
we&#39;ll discuss how governments change
interest rates now in topic two we will
also discuss shorting currencies because
ax does this this episode and we&#39;ll
discuss how George Soros made $1 billion
in one day when he shorted the British
pound and this is a special situation
because in almost all occasions
short-term trading does not work let&#39;s
start with topic one which is day
trading in this episode axe&#39;s
Investments are down for the first time
ever in a given quarter and he&#39;s got
three days left in the quarter to make
money and so what he does is he puts
tremendous pressure on his portfolio
managers and analysts to make money and
only 3 days but can they do it what do
you have for me I&#39;m peeling back the
skin on territory petroleum they&#39;re
sitting on good numbers if they come out
bump Sev too late when the numbers come
out we&#39;re dead man walking now that
energy sector portfolio manager thinks
that earnings will be great when the
company reports but it won&#39;t be until
next quarter so what other ideas do his
employees have Ferguson rip our liquid
Longs I&#39;ve got a few positions on my
book that are ready for juicing and we
could add some classy names to the
investor window dressing now that
analyst said to sell illiquid stocks
that have lost him money and replace
them with high quality stocks before the
end of the quarter why did he say that
because if you manage over $100 million
in assets like axe Capital does then by
law you have to disclose to the market
what you own every single quarter and
window dressing means let&#39;s buy a bunch
of great stocks at the end of the
quarter so investors see the amazing
stocks that we own and not the losers
that c cost us money but this does not
solve axe&#39;s problem of showing a
negative return in the quarter and axe
actually has issues trying to get his
employees to day trade to make money
really really fast and as a result he
explodes with this comment you are all
playing it safe for the quarter so you
have a shot of personally being up on
the year you are all
selfish accurate now at hedge funds at
least close to year end portfolio
managers like to lock in their profit
profit so they get a bonus which is
often 10% of what The Firm made that
year what is not accurate about this is
that axe is trying to force his
employees to make money in three days by
day trading and later on in this video
you&#39;re watching right now I&#39;ll teach you
how the best hedge funds invest but
first and I say this with love my heart
please please please please please do
not day trade because it will all end
badly and there&#39;s a reason we cannot
name a single day trader that&#39;s been
successful primarily focused on day
trading in the long run because they
don&#39;t exist why is that because in the
short run stocks go up or down for
really random reasons outside of our
control for example comments from
political leaders or geopolitical issues
like war or anything that can make
Commodities like oil go up a lot or down
a lot or even economic data points like
unemployment or inflation statistics can
make stocks go up or down a lot and it&#39;s
really hard to forecast the short-term
events now each month has 20 week days
meaning 20 days that the major markets
are open and it&#39;s absolutely impossible
it&#39;s impossible to make money every
month now please read this book by Talib
called Fooled by Randomness for more
details now the worst thing that can
ever happen to a new day trader is they
make money on their first trade why is
that because it&#39;s the exact same thing
as going to a casino the first time and
making money on your first bet and
people think it&#39;s repeatable but the
casino or the market always wins in the
long run and not the Gambler or the day
trader so please don&#39;t be seduced by day
trading and as Warren Buffett said the
longer the view the wiser the intention
in fact when Warren Buffett invests in a
stock he tells himself that he doesn&#39;t
care if the stock market is closed for
10 years after he buys a stock Buffett
has owned Coca-Cola for decades and he
said if you bought COC on the first day
meaning during the IPO you would be down
50% one year later but if you didn&#39;t
sell a share then of course you would
have made a killing uh in the long run
separately look at this chart here from
2012 to 2024 it&#39;s a basically a five
Baggar if you just held on to it now can
you guess what investment this chart
represents and imagine how much money
you would lose if you try to day trade
this chart now do you know what
investment this is
this is the S&amp;amp;P 500 and we&#39;ll talk about
investing in individual stocks in a
second but when you invest tell yourself
I don&#39;t know the path but I know the
destination and you&#39;ll sleep better at
night and you won&#39;t pay as much in taxes
as you pay less in capital gains tax if
you hold something for more than a year
before booking profits and in a second
I&#39;ll show you how to do research on
investments so you don&#39;t have to day
trade and so you don&#39;t have to rely on
only investing in ETF
but first if all you did was you put
your 401K retirement annual Savings of
about $23,000 in the S&amp;amp;P 500 for every
year for 20 years then in 20 years you
would have over a million do and if
you&#39;re supposed to it too then You&#39; had
over $2 million and you wouldn&#39;t have a
heart attack every time the market sold
off for random reasons that you can&#39;t
control so by being longer term focused
your wealth and your health will benefit
now if a hedge fund makes money every
month then they are cooking the books
and potentially breaking the law with
Insider information and the best
performing hedge funds are actually not
day Traders they put on one to threeyear
positions with a very wellth thought out
investment thesis that thoroughly
analyzes the fundamentals of a company
in the very long run and the grandfather
of hedge funds is Julian Robertson who
founded hedge fund tiger in the 1980s
and he was very long-term focused and
many of his many of his employees
started their own longer term Focus
hedge funds called tiger cubs per these
examples you see right here and it&#39;s a
misconception that successful hedge
funds are day traders in the in the long
run most of the money that successful
hedge funds make are based on a handful
of ideas each year that they do a ton of
research on and these companies that
they invest in can double or triple in a
year so how do they do this research
well I&#39;m going to to show you and by law
successful hedge funds have no
information or knowledge Edge or
advantage over you and so I created this
100 step investment idea spreadsheet
that analyzes every aspect of a company
based on your research and this is based
on my Decades of investing experience
now in this spreadsheet I ask you 730
questions based on your research that
you type into the spreadsheet to help
you with a long-term stock investment
idea and after completing the
spreadsheet you will have a one pager
automatically created for you ignore my
dummy data here but this one pager
analyzes the company for you and helps
you come up with a Target price now
what&#39;s also included based on your
research is a massive dashboard that
visualizes your analysis and a 100 plus
page investment research report as well
now there&#39;s 100 steps here in three
categories that professional investors
analyze including quality ative research
topics at the top here quantitative
research topics in the middle and
financial modelbased research at the
bottom and the professional hedge funds
have no Edge on you because we all have
access to the exact same research
sources as they do meaning annual
reports corly reports press releases
online webcasts we can attend for free
investor relations content Etc now each
tab on this spreadsheet has a long
YouTube video in the 20th row you click
on it there explaining in lots of detail
how professional hedge funds complete
each of the 100
steps and qualitative research here
includes analyzing the management team
catalysts drivers barriers to entry and
much more quick side note I always start
with analyzing the management team
because ideas are Commodities but
execution is not and I usually hate
investing in companies where the founder
is no longer running the
company now top hedge funds also analyze
quantitative data like the total
addressable market market growth market
share Etc and if you don&#39;t analyze the
data then you only have an opinion and
not a wellth thought out uh investment
idea then all this stuff feeds into the
hedge funds most important part of their
investment research which is financial
research and building and forecasting
your financial model in order to come up
with a Target price in the long run on
the company that you&#39;re investing in now
do you ever look at a stock and think I
love this company but it&#39;s expensive at
100 times this year or next year&#39;s
earnings well the best hedge funds and
investors do not value companies based
on their earnings estimates this year or
next year rather they value companies
based on their earnings per share
estimates in 3 5 or 10 years from
today and this is why many stocks look
expensive today to most investors now
years ago I invested in Amazon as a long
position at a hedge fund I worked at and
my colleagues would say to me Chris
you&#39;re cray cray to invest in Amazon
because it trades over 100 times
earnings and this is a Widowmaker for
you and I said no it trades at only four
times my earnings estimates in 5 years
meaning a PE of
four so we need to really do our own
research and forecast financial
statements many years into the future in
order to understand the true earnings
power of companies that we want to
invest in and this is the secret to how
many successful hedge funds make money
they&#39;re not day Traders they&#39;re
long-term focused and my clients and
students use this and many other
Frameworks I created for them so always
do your own research and don&#39;t ever buy
a stock after you watch a video of
someone pitching a stock to you why
because if you don&#39;t do your own
then you might buy poor Quality
Companies or even worse you might sell
the stock if it goes down and as Warren
Buffett said the New York Stock Exchange
is the only store in the world where
consumer sells stuff when it goes on
sale now instead of being day Traders
successful investors that work at the
top hedge funds spend a lot of time
building their financial models which
you can easily do as well instead of
wasting time on looking at technical
analysis now don&#39;t only look at
technicals for your investment research
spend way more time forecasting your
financial statements which you can
easily learn to do which is what I teach
so how can you learn accounting and
finance from scratch and also get access
to this spreadsheet well what you can do
is you can check out my book that McGraw
Hill published called Finance Essentials
for managers which gives you all the
tools you need to succeed as a
non-financial professional and the link
is in the description of this video to
this book and a link to download this
spreadsheet and many other spreadsheets
and resources are included uh in this
book of mine and I promise you that you
will make much more money in the long
run if you do your own thorough research
instead of day
trend now you might be thinking Chris
how do I even come up with an idea of
what stock to invest it well it all
begins with an investment theme for
example let&#39;s go to a free website
together called ETF db.com meaning ETF
database where you can analyze thousands
of ETFs and let&#39;s scroll down right here
and let&#39;s pick a random investment theme
like lithium let&#39;s say you&#39;re bullish on
lithium well we can click here on
lithium for example and then we could
select a a lithium ETF here and we can
look at the Holdings of this lithium ETF
and we can start to do Bottoms Up
research on one of these companies here
now the way you know that you have a
good investment idea is if you complete
the entire 100 steps of the investment
right up and this acts as a safety net
so that we don&#39;t get seduced into
dayri let&#39;s get back to season 2 episode
5 of billions how much is ax Capital
down this quarter if the quarter ended
today we&#39;d be underwater like Crimson
hide Sanic has pulled us down to -
2.3% so a Down 2 .3% return on a quarter
is nothing especially since this is ax
capital&#39;s first down quarter ever nobody
makes money every month or every quarter
and if they do then statistically they
are likely doing something unethical now
if you chase performance into month or
quarter end then it will more often than
not hurt you more in the long run that
much I promise you now what some hedge
funds do when they have a down quarter
is they take their private Venture
Capital Investments if they own them and
then they have their back office mark up
the value of that asset in order to hide
the losses in their stock market
portfolio and this could be unethical if
not done correctly of course for example
let&#39;s say axe Capital had a $500 million
investment in a private AI Venture back
company that they own and the value of
the private investment went up a lot
then what they could do is they could
revalue or mark up that investment from
say a $500 million investment to 1
billion uh investment which would more
than offset the 2.3% loss on the quarter
they do this all the time now what other
hedge funds do is if they&#39;re ever down
say 4.9% in a month and if they&#39;re
worried about Investors getting really
upset uh in a month where they&#39;re down
way more than 5% then what they can do
is they can take a knee meaning they use
options or adjust their stock portfolio
so they don&#39;t lose more than 4.9% of
month now the best hedge funds don&#39;t
usually have to consider doing this
though because they have superb risk
management metrics meaning they will
never be too long or Too Short the
market and they won&#39;t have more than 5%
in anyone&#39;s stock for example and very
sophisticated hedge funds use options to
hedge their positions to ensure that
they don&#39;t have a massive down month
which I talked about in this video right
here and the link is in the description
to this video now there are no ethical
shortcuts and axe&#39;s most unethical
portfolio manager has this to say in
front of Axe and axe&#39;s compliance
director who ensures that no Insider
information is used when investing where
see it we need a quick fix in a
non-quick fix Market
yeah I have an idea but apparently I
can&#39;t give it to
you now when you&#39;re driving somewhere
and you&#39;re running late you might take a
shortcut but then you might get lost and
so never take a shortcut you&#39;ve never
taken before when you&#39;re in a hurry now
axe&#39;s compliance director then tells axe
that it&#39;s okay to be down because you&#39;re
human so to get around this axe does
this you were wrong I&#39;m not human I am a
machine I&#39;m a
Terminator he then fired his compliance
director because he does not know how to
make money in the short run without
break in the law now axe could not get
his Equity meaning stock market analyst
to give him an idea that can make money
in only 3 days before the quarter ends
so he turns through another source to
give axe Insider information on currency
trading and so topic two of two is how
do governments change interest rates the
Nigerian government is going to devalue
currency you know that the Central Bank
Governor told me now the Central Bank
governor in Nigeria is the equivalent of
the Federal Reserve in the United States
now if a stock or a currency goes down
investors can make money betting against
it by shorting it so in this case the
Central Bank of Nigeria is going to make
the value of the Nigerian naira go down
versus the US dollar why perhaps to get
International investors to want to
invest more in
Nigeria if a country&#39;s currency goes
down then all the stuff that that
country sells becomes cheaper which
attracts International investors
especially Chinese companies that want
to purchase natural
resources and when central banks or the
Federal Reserve wants their own currency
to go down in value what they do is they
make it go down by cutting interest
rates so how does the central bank or
the fellow Reserve cut interest rates in
order to make the value of their
currency go down well they do so by
increasing the supply of money out there
and we know that when the supply of
anything like baseball or Pokémon cards
goes up then the price usually goes down
and vice versa so let me explain how
this whole process works with a couple
of of props okay this is kind of tight
there are two types of medicine that
governments use to fix the economy okay
one is called fiscal policy which means
spending money on stuff like highways to
employ people uh and help the economy
and the other one is called monetary
policy which is the policy of money now
in this monetary policy medicine bag we
have a tool that can cut interest rates
see what we have in here aha here it is
here okay so we have a tool that can cut
rates how well let&#39;s assume that I the
Federal Reserve in the United States and
you are all banks and investors if I
want to cut interest rates to jumpstart
the economy I can increase the money
supply out there this is fake money now
if the supply of money goes up then the
price goes down and the price means
interest rate so how do I do this well
Banks and investors own US government
bonds Let&#39;s Pretend This is a US
Government Bond that you own okay so
remember I&#39;m the government I&#39;m the
Federal Reserve what I&#39;m going to do is
I&#39;m going to give you all money so I can
buy this Bond back from all of you okay
so here&#39;s your money and I bought this
Bond back now because there&#39;s more money
out there okay in the marketplace the
supply money goes up then that means
that the price of money goes down
meaning interest rates go down now if
that&#39;s complicated think about it this
way let&#39;s pretend that I&#39;m Nintendo okay
and I made three of these products here
okay three
Marios and the price of these three
Marios is really really high because
it&#39;s a collector&#39;s item now let&#39;s say
that Nintendo makes 8 million more of
these then the price of Mario will go
down because the supply increased
so if I&#39;m the Federal Reserve and I want
to increase interest rates then I need
to decrease the amount of money out
there okay so what I can do is I can
sell bonds to you okay so I give this to
you and then you give me your money okay
I sold this to you now there&#39;s less
money out there in
circulation now the most powerful weapon
any country has is the ability to change
interest rates why is that well let&#39;s go
back in time together okay it&#39;s 1944 and
let me get my hat here okay it&#39;s 1944
and I&#39;m Canadian I was born in Canada
it&#39;s 1944 and I&#39;m the Bank of Canada I
want to find a way to raise money so I
can do my part in building tanks and
stuff to help fight the bad people in
World War II how can I do this well as
you can see here what I can do is I can
sell you bonds I sell you bonds okay and
you give me your money then I use the
money that you gave me to help ensure
that freedom
prevails now imagine if the Bank of
Canada can&#39;t do this anymore well
freedom and capitalism would not
exist now as a quick side
note now you probably understand why
some left-leaning countries make
cryptocurrencies illegal it&#39;s because
without the flexibility of selling bonds
governments would fail and so the
biggest threat to National Security for
some left leaning countries is actually
cryptocurrencies now Bobby Axel Rob
realizes that if he wants to manipulate
the value of the Nigerian naira by
transacting in size to change the value
of the naira versus the dollar he can&#39;t
do it himself because he does not have
enough money so instead he does this
Nigeria is going to devalue its
currency get the hell out of here how
could you know that because we&#39;re going
to make it
happen so that&#39;s accurate axe actually
set up what&#39;s called an idea dinner with
other large hedge funds to help him with
this trade and idea dinners are very
common on Wall Street so that hedge
funds can talk their books meaning
promote their own Holdings to other
investors now there are precedents for
this idea dinner in this episode as well
because when George Soros forced the
bank of England in 1992 to devalue the
pound and made a billion dollars in one
day he partnered with other large hedge
funds like what Bobby is trying to do
right here now you&#39;re probably thinking
Chris wait a second you said earlier
that day trading does not work well this
is a special situation that involved
billions of coordinated dollars and
multiple Financial Services firms
partnering together with each other and
even then the risk are insanely High
currency plays are all about timing you
get in too late there&#39;s nothing there
but you get in too early they raise
interest rates and bed you out of your
position agreed being early is the same
as being wrong Soros then did the exact
same thing by partnering with other
hedge funds in 1997 to short the tie bot
and George Soros made another billion
dollars in 2013 and 2014 by shorting the
Yen now how much money does Axe want to
invest in the currency short position
the threshold is five billion I&#39;m in it
for two that leaves one each for you
three so which is the more powerful
driver boning me or your own
self-interest not accurate there&#39;s no
way that axe would invest well over 20%
of his portfolio in one trade I mean
that&#39;s really poor risk management
especially since he&#39;s trying to throw a
hail Mar pass just recoup a 2.3%
loss let&#39;s talk about grading this
episode for Wall Street realism with a
buy holder cell rating the episode did
an awesome job of showing how hedge fund
employees try to lock in profits by
being very conservative with investing
at the end of a quarter so they can lock
in their bonus and the episode also did
a superb job of showing how an
incredibly unethical hedge fund might
try to chase performance with Insider
information and current manipulation in
order to profit however there is no way
that a large hedge fund would put on a
20% risky position in a currency for the
sole reason of offsetting a manageable
2.3% quarterly loss as a result I&#39;m
going to give this episode a hold rating
