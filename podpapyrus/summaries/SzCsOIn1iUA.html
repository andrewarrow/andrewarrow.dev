Astros topped the Red Sox. This game had
everything. Carlos Kareah&#39;s first game
back with them playing I&#39;m Coming Home
for his walk up music. Alex Bregman
returns to Houston. First AB, two-run
home run. Second AB, they&#39;re booing him
and he&#39;s on the opposition. That is
exactly how you do it. Oh, also Garrett
Crochet had his worst start of the year.
Season high tying five runs allowed. Two
electric innings and then he fell apart.
Also, Christian Javier makes his return
for the first time since May of 2024
from Tommy John surgery. He looked
pretty good. And lastly, Josh her was
unavailable. Some shoulder discomfort.
They used him a lot. What was that a
couple days ago in that series against
the Yankees? He had a 36 pitch outing.
Hopefully, he&#39;s okay. Astros bullpen
bent. Did not break. This had to be cool
for you to watch all this. It feels like
2017, 18, 19 again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, this is the We didn&#39;t think We
didn&#39;t think when the season started
that with all the subtractions that the
Astros had, they would be in this spot.
But why why do we ever question them?
They just figure out how to win. And
then they went and Jim Crane said,
&#34;Yeah, sure. I&#39;ll take on Kareah&#39;s
contract.&#34; And Kareah&#39;s gone out and I
think he&#39;s got a nine-game hitting
streak. They got to, in my opinion, one
of the top three pitchers in the
American League right now in Crochet. He
dominated him the first time through the
order. They made some adjustments. They
picked some things out. They got to him.
To me, this is like this is throwback to
to the to yeah, like you said, the 1819
like these teams and fortunately they
they could be coming down to the end
here where they could be battling for a
wild card position if the Mariners catch
the Astros, which I think they might if
haters out, but they could be battling.
This series is this series is huge and
it has all the all the storylines that
you want to see in at this point in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here&#39;s here&#39;s my thing. This is a bonus
win for the Astros for me because if you
would have told them going into this
game as hot as the Mariners have been
and as bad I mean not bad but the Astros
haven&#39;t been playing great. You lose
you know people here and there left and
right, left and right, left and right.
But you go back to Houston. Koreah&#39;s
back. Great. Everyone&#39;s excited. You&#39;re
facing Garrick Crochet who&#39;s one of the
best pitchers in the league and has been
dominant. And you&#39;re pitching Christian
Javier. So you you&#39;re not one of your
main guys. Yes, he&#39;s been there before,
but he hasn&#39;t been great for him. And he
hasn&#39;t pitched for a long time. He
wasn&#39;t even great on rehab. And they win
this game. This is like two or three
wins for the Astros. Because this is a
game going into it, you would have been
like, Astros have no chance in this
game. And they win this game. It&#39;s a big
deal. It is a confident confident boost.
confidence boost for these Astros to win
that game last night, especially after
you fell behind two nothing in the first
two hitters. Whack whack, you&#39;re down
two nothing. You&#39;re like, &#34;Oh boy, what
do we got ourselves into, you come back
and you put a big number up on Crochet,
hold on to win this game.&#34; This is a big
win for the Astros.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they were avoiding Abrau pitched
twice this past weekend. Annie also
warmed up in the one game he didn&#39;t
pitch in. Hater had the situation like
I&#39;m talking about, shoulder discomfort.
They&#39;re going to check him out. So
there&#39;s your two best relievers who have
been two of the best in baseball this
year. And Bennett Souza had to shut it
down against Roman Anthony who had
homerred earlier in the game. Anthony
steps up, tying run at second base and
they shut it down. So it&#39;s a one-run
win. I mean that&#39;s a fun game to attend
if you&#39;re an Astros fan. You also find
out before the game you&#39;re one of your
top few prospects, Jake Jacob Melton, is
getting the call for Houston to see what
he looks like. He had an 880 OPS in AAA.
He was a second round pick in 2022. How
about trades? Ramona Reas was kind of
one of the smaller pickups crats. Boom.
Two-run homer. His first bit, the Astros
comes off Jordan Hicks, who was acquired
in the Raphael Devers deal. So, yeah. I
mean, this was an allaround awesome day
if you&#39;re a Houston fan showing up to
the yard when your team&#39;s in a fight for
the division.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, it is. To me, the to me the Red Sox
question, I got to ask it to AJ though,
the Red Sox side of this. when you guys
were a young team with the Twins,
what kind of like were you guys just
when you made the playoffs, were you
guys just playing with house money kind
of thing? Because to me, if the if the
Red Sox hold on and I feel like the Red
Sox may falter here and be the one on
the outside looking in at the end of the
playoffs here, I don&#39;t think like how do
you how do you learn during this time
the pressure packed situation? I I get
it. Roman Anthony hit a big time dinger
in a, you know, in a environment in
Houston that was kind of hostile to the
Red Sox to Bregman when he comes up the
next inning and he&#39;s he&#39;s getting booed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean? What do you I don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When you&#39;re young, this team this team
is super young.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The whole position player core.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How do you get like how did you guys
come together in the sense of like,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hey, you know what? we&#39;re gonna make the
playoffs because nobody nobody on your
team had any playoff experience. Nobody
on their team had any playoff
experience. Like,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well, here&#39;s my Well, yeah, but see, we
had we had all come up together um
through the minor leagues. A lot of us
with the Twins. So, I just think that
you know what, we just we just expected
to win. Now listen, 2001, our first full
year alto together, we had a lead on the
Indians at the time, now the Guardians,
but they had Tomy and they had all the I
mean, Kenny Loftton and Roberto Alamar
and they had a squad, right? And we
lost. We we we kind of blew it. We faded
because it was our first full year. We
didn&#39;t know what we were going to do.
2002, we went into it and said, &#34;We&#39;re
winning the division and we&#39;re going to
make a run in the playoffs because we
just felt we were that good.&#34; And we win
the division handily. We lost in the
ALCS to the Angels, but we never there
was never like a doubt. In 2001, I I
mean, we honestly thought we were going
to make it that year and we kind of I
mean, I don&#39;t want to say we choked, but
we just fell off because we didn&#39;t
really know. And how do you learn? You
learn through that experience. The
difference in the Red Sox is you got
Bregman, you got Trevor story. You got
some guys that have been through it
before. It&#39;s not like this team is
totally young. I mean, they have some
guys that have been through some stuff
before that can relate it. When I was in
the Twins, we had nobody. I mean, in
2001, we didn&#39;t have anybody. Brad
Radkkey never been to the playoffs. Eric
Milton, our starting staff, had never
been to the playoffs. Kyle Los, Joe
Mazize, these guys had never we had like
literally not one guy on our team that
ever been to the playoffs. 2002, we
brought in a little couple Rick Reed and
some older guys and made some
adjustments and that was when we got
better. But we you until you go through
162 games with that intensity. You don&#39;t
really know. I think the Red Sox are
going to be fine though because I think
they&#39;re better and they&#39;ve gotten better
through the year, which is nice. And
Roman Anony&#39;s going to be a stud.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, he looks like it. Yeah, he&#39;s got
it all working right now. One more thing
on the Astros side. Chaz McCormick hit
his first home run since August of 2024.
I mean, this was a total throwback glory
days game for the Astros cuz it&#39;s been a
rough go for Chaz over the past year or
so. But good for him to get back on the
board. He had a big game yesterday for
Houston. So, the Astros take game one of
this series. We&#39;ll be watching more of
this. Yeah, for me last night, this was
an easy pay light attention to what&#39;s
going on during that time period, but
heavy attention to the game in Houston.
It was really fun. Playoff vibes. Hey,
we love ripping slab packs on Arena
Club. I just ripped one in a Ruby pack.
Those are fancy, Kip. And I pulled a
Matt Shaw 2023 Bowman Draft Aqua Lunar
Crater Refractor card. And guess what?
Guess what? I got a little offer. You
get the instant offer right away. Okay,
so they&#39;re offering me 121 bucks. Sell
it back and then I can get a new slab
pack. What do I do?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I want to see this thing. Hold on. Look
at that. That&#39;s a beautiful card. You
know what? I think that&#39;s a safe bet. I
think it&#39;s going to make you a little
bit money. I think the more more big
league time he gets. I&#39;d almost take the
deal, though. I&#39;m I&#39;m in it for the
chase. I like opening more packs. I
think that 121 can buy you a couple more
slabs to open. And uh I think you keep
chasing until you get someone you really
like. But that&#39;s the best part about it
for me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s right. You can sell it back 121
bucks and then open up another slab
pack. Use the code foul to receive 20%
