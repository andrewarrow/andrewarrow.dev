put an IV in you after she [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
pieces you up a little bit. But I&#39;m just
saying be aware. Women from Philly, they
wanted bottoms.
You know, I want a woman that wants a
little bit of a bottom on things. That&#39;s
who I am. So, praise God and God bless
everybody. What&#39;s happening? We just had
some good shows everywhere. You know,
most of them are pretty good these days,
I think. I mean, I know it&#39;s hit or miss
in some of the venues. Um, I&#39;m just
saying from an actual aspect of uh
trying to pull it off. Um,
where do we go? Yeah, Philly, Rochester.
Uh, we just had some out in San Diego
Oceanside, which is beautiful. If you
get to go there, everybody pulled up.
Um, a lot of great folks and a lot of
Mexican people, too. Uh, and I want to
say something. I want to say something
right now. I want to give a round of
to all the Mexican people for keeping
this country going.

Thank you.
What else is going on? Um, let&#39;s get
into some news. I could tell you more
about me. I&#39;ve been a little bit burnt,
but I don&#39;t want to go into that. What
am I dealing with? Let me think about
what I&#39;m dealing with maybe just on a
personal level for a minute. What&#39;s
happening? Uh,
we have a Netflix special that we&#39;re
coming up with soon. We&#39;re going to tape
that in New York City. So just uh if you
if you check on social media on our
Instagrams, we&#39;ll put it up on there. So
it&#39;s exciting. Um and just thank you to
everybody that&#39;s come out over this
tour. It&#39;s almost over. Um and I just
can&#39;t believe it all the places that
we&#39;ve been and uh and some of the shows
are, you know, we always tried our best,
but thank you guys for showing up and
trying your best, too. And uh giving the
live show um a chance. And uh yeah, I&#39;ve
definitely learned a lot and yeah, so I
just want to say thank you very much and
I appreciate you for coming out and I
hope I can return the favor to you uh in
our lifetime. Um what else is popping
with me personally? I went to Hulk
Hogan&#39;s funeral. Yeah. My tour manager
and I went down and
and it was, you know, you get down there
and it&#39;s beautiful. It was down in
Largo, Florida. And um we ended up
meeting up with Kid Rock or yeah I was
having dinner with him a couple nights
before and he&#39;s like do you want to go
to he said mentioned he was going down
and I was like oh I&#39;m going to go to the
funeral and then he&#39;s like uh let&#39;s
let&#39;s let&#39;s go. So we went and so that
was the crew.
We get down there and we got to I mean
it&#39;s in a beautiful church down there.
Where was that church? Zack, if you can
look that up for me really fast. Where
was that church down there? Indian
River. Indian.
Oh, that&#39;s a damn casino, actually.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Indian Rocks Baptist almost. I&#39;m
just saying that thing&#39;s a couple of,
you know, a couple slow weekends away
from being getting overtaken by a
casino, bro. It sounds like. But, uh,
anyway, beautiful place. Indian Rocks
Baptist Church, you know. Um, and they
have like a baptism. Um, it&#39;s actually
where Hulk Hogan got baptized not too
long ago. Um they played that during the
memorial service and it was nice,
beautiful place there. Um
uh a lot of people sitting in there and
you walk in and there&#39;s a lot of people
in there, you know. Hacksaw was in
there. Um Mount of the South, Jimmy Hart
was in there, Ric Flair was in there. Um
Dennis Rodman&#39;s was in there and he kind
of like he kind of you know I think as
as they were pushing the casket out it
kind of shook like wobbled a little bit
and he Rodman kind of stopped it which
was kind of crazy. He was like you know
like one last rebound kind of just you
know he kind of
just just helped tow the line there and
just kind of keep the Hulk headed to
heaven I guess straight away. And um but
yeah, it was just, you know, it was kind
of crazy because you&#39;re walking, you
know, for me, I was walking through a
lot of my childhood, just the moments of
all these wrestlers and some of them&#39;s
in wheelchairs and some of them&#39;s in,
you know, some of them got on chain mail
and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] or fake spines, all kind of
they got everybody&#39;s in there. Fake arm,
fake neck. You got, you know, people in
there with so many missing parts. It&#39;s
just a damn Jim McMahon Build-A-Bear
over there at that Hulk Hogan funeral
over there.
but yeah, so it was kind of wild just to
see like all like, you know, parts of my
heroes and stuff like that and like and
see heroes from when I was a child
because there was nobody bigger to us uh
than professional wrestlers. I&#39;m going
say that right out loud. And I&#39;mma say
that our love for professional wrestlers
was bottomless, bro. Point blank, homie.
We just loved them, dude. I mean, they
like me and my buddy William would stay
up at night and try to watch Saturday
night main event when Hulk Mania would
show up on there and the big boss man
and bam bam bigo. We me and my buddy
William, both of us were falling asleep.
We would hold each other&#39;s eyes open. I
would hold his open and he would hold
mine open and we would just hold each
other&#39;s eyes open, boy. Yeah.
And we eat as many of those red hot
fireballs as we could so our mouths
would be like they were dripping blood.
And we spray WD40 on our arms and on
each other&#39;s backs. Yeah.
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] yeah. Get it on my back, Whitey.
And we would do that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] boy.
And we would fall just wait there
until they came on the screen. The
wrestlers,
ultimate warrior.
Rudy the ravi ravishing
h not rapist or whatever. What? I don&#39;t
know who that guy was. Oh yeah. With the
hair cutters. The gardener. This like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] gardener. He had like gardener
shears and he would [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] cut your
mom&#39;s hair or something and then she
would be a pregnant, you know.
So anyway, yeah, but the wrestling it
was like we looked up to those guys, you
know, like on our street, a lot of the
kids there wasn&#39;t a lot to look up to,
you know, there wasn&#39;t a lot to look up
to. So, um,
those wrestlers when they, you know, it
was like I don&#39;t know, wrestling to me,
it felt like it was for poor people,
bro. I&#39;mma say that out loud. You know,
it just all the character I don&#39;t know.
It just I think there was no barrier to
entry for wrestling, right? You didn&#39;t
have to have a hoop or a pool. There was
nothing you had to have. You had to have
a younger sibling who was willing to get
okay? You had to have a spare neck brace
and that was all you had to have and you
could be a professional wrestler
in your house for a little while until
your sister got [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
bad off. I remember one time one buddy&#39;s
sister, she&#39;d been [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] they&#39;d put
her in a damn,
you know, my one buddy&#39;s finishing move
was the damn biopsy.
And that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] God, you know, you could
hear one of her eyes just rattling in
the back of her throat like one of those
uh lotto balls just coming up the pipe
before you knew the number. I mean, my
buddy would he would really rip his
sister up. And but uh anyway,
everybody&#39;s fine now as adults pretty
good. But I remember she was all banged
up and they had to put it to use a
couple damn uh broom handles. I mean
full broom handles, not those little,
you know, just them little kitchen [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
sticks. I&#39;m talking about that janitor
thing, that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know, that
janitor carries that big fryer tuck
broom. That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] got that that 2-in
girth on that big thing, that handle.
and they had her keyed up to a couple of
that O&#39;s like a damn scarecrow trying to
keep her body organized enough so she
could finish school.
So anyway, sorry, let me get back to it.
But when wrestling came on TV, man, it
was like even if I felt horrible about
myself as a kid or if I felt ashamed of
where we lived, um you know, if I felt I
don&#39;t know, if I felt like I didn&#39;t have
somebody looking out for me or just all
that stuff, all that stuff that I felt
as a child, right? And I&#39;m not not I
don&#39;t need any self-pity. I&#39;m just
telling you those things I had, you
know, that was part of my part of my
heart and brain at the time. And um all
that would go away, man, when that
wrestling came on, you know, like when
Hulk Hogan came on there, it like it
just gave me something like I literally
gave me something to look up to. I look
I would sit there and look up at the
screen, you know?
It was just, you know, it just gave you
something like it just made you feel
kind of like thing, you know,
something&#39;s possible.
You might need steroids and you might
need, you know, a lot of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] fake
sweat or whatever.
You might need to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] rub your body
against another man at night in
different cities around the world,
but you can figure it out.
And yeah, I just love that, man. There
was something about it in our
neighborhood, man.
So yeah, shout out to my buddy Will
Teague over there, Eddie Joe, Larry
um, uh, Robbie Taylor, the whole gang
over there. We loved wrestling, man. It
was, it was everything to us. So, thank
you to Hulk Hogan and all the wrestlers
that gave us that just gave us that
feeling of like, yeah, I&#39;m going to show
up and I&#39;mma rip my [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] shirt off
and I&#39;m going to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
DDT somebody at my workplace.
That was good [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Anyway, um but yeah,
so it was just wild, you know, to get to
see a lot of different heroes and part
of me wanted to stay longer.
Um the people that I went with were left
early and so I couldn&#39;t stay. I wanted
to kind of mill around and I got to say
some hellos and meet some new people and
uh but I just felt really lucky to go.
Um Nick Hogan was there, Hulk&#39;s son.
That was nice. I&#39;ve met him before, but
I got to see his wife u meet her and um
Linda Sky uh to a Hulk&#39;s his wife and
ex-wife. Um,
and one thing that I thought was pretty
neat was whenever Nick Hogan was up
there, he was just making a speech and
he&#39;s like, you know, he said that, you
know, he believes that his father&#39;s
watching over him. And then he kind of
said, he kind of did like a bit of an
impersonation of his dad and he&#39;s like,
&#34;What you going to do when the Hulkster
is watching over you?&#34; And I thought
that was pretty cool. Anyway, that&#39;s
through it through the wrestling. Uh,
what else is going on? Let&#39;s get into a
little bit of news. We&#39;ve got some calls
from you guys. I&#39;m I do want to, you
know, I want to try and do more regular
episodes. I know I said that before. Um,
but with this tour almost done, I&#39;m
excited to get a little bit more space
so I can feel and uh I want to I want to
have more space in my head to be
and to feel. Man, there&#39;s there&#39;s days I
can&#39;t even feel. And I&#39;m not
complaining. I&#39;m just like, dang, this
is life. You just get, you know, you get
going. And it&#39;s hard to tap in sometimes
and have a conversation with somebody
where your feelings need to be present.
And um
and I and that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve really
always loved about this podcast was just
like the presentness of feelings. And so
I am looking forward to having a little
more just space in my life and time to
make that a possibility. So but we&#39;ll
see. You know what I&#39;m saying? I&#39;ve said
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] before, but anyway. But yeah,
thank you guys so much for support on
this tour. I can&#39;t even believe it. I
want to make a whole slideshow that I&#39;m
going to put together and maybe put out
um just to like just show like some
different moments, people that we met
along the way and things like that. Uh
I&#39;ll have to figure that out exactly how
I&#39;m going to do that. What do we have
here? We got um
new news here. Morgan Wallen will not
submit music for 2026 Grammys. Um,
Wallen, who&#39;s never won a Grammy despite
his status as being the biggest artist
in country music, has the bestselling
album of 2025 with I&#39;m the Problem.
Morgan Waller will not be submitting his
music for consideration of the 2026
Grammy Awards. Good for them, man. Good

quit saying you could use us for your
awards and they don&#39;t have any awards,
boy, and the people choose.
So, but also, what the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] am I talking
about? I don&#39;t know. And I&#39;m sure

I wish they gave you a real Grammy.
That&#39;s what I wish.
Oh, they gave you one of these old
herinade things right here. Now, I wish
they gave you a real ass Grammy, boy.
Just a beautiful little grandmother
would come out and hug you. That&#39;s what
we should do,
dude. You win a Grammy and then we have
like six Grammys back behind a curtain,
And one of them, you know, they spark
one of them up a little bit. They kind
of, you know, touch her in the back with
a fork or something. Nothing heavy, but
just, you know, she&#39;s doing Grammy
stuff. She&#39;s knitting or something. You
got to get her attention. And then that
one rolls out from behind the curtain
and hugs whoever wins. Dude, that would
be great.
Bro, you telling me I would love a hug
from somebody&#39;s grandmother.
those hugs are
just the way you land in them. It&#39;s like
being at a spa.
You get a young hug from one of these
young [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Some of them are strong
and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] They got,
you know, some chick hugged me that day.
She had a couple damn dumbbells in her
hand, two barbells,
three and a half pounders. Like, what
the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is this?
But you get a hug from a grandmother,
she got them damn catcher mitts full of
She got two of them [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] baby.
And them arms go right into the tits.
They ain&#39;t even a difference, bro.
That&#39;s just a big bicep
bicep tit. That&#39;s just a damn [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
That&#39;s a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] love seat.
And she got them two arms like a damn
front end loader. That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] will hug
you. God.
So that&#39;s what I would like to see. Cuz
a lot of that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] man, I don&#39;t care
about that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Put me on your thing.
You do this. Do you want this, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
What is that,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] What is that?
Then you choose who you think&#39;s the
best. That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] sold everything
out there.
He sold everything out there.
He Dude, I remember I was talking to
Morgan a couple weeks ago. He said he
couldn&#39;t even get a ticket to his own
show, bro. That&#39;s how sold out them
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] are, dog. So, what are y&#39;all
even [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] playing, bro? Good for him,
man. [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] them.
So, but now also, I can&#39;t sing, so I
could never win one.
But I almost won fifth place in that
school. spelling B, baby. They put me in
that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] It was me in the final two
and this girl named Helina. Some people
called her big Helina. I didn&#39;t do it,
but some people did.
And the word that I misspelled was
inconvenience.
And she was pregnant at the time.
And she got it. She got it right.
That&#39;s how it was. They said, &#34;Can you
use it in a sentence?&#34; And they&#39;re like,
&#34;Being pregnant in middle school would
be an inconvenience.&#34;
And that cracked the code for it. That
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] hit rattled off them letters.
Rattled off them letters. Let me see how
many letters and inconvenience, man. Me
look it up here on my perplexity. That&#39;s
what I use. Some people use other AIS. I
like this one. It&#39;s a little more
uh professional. Let me see.
Inconvenience has 13 letters if you
spell it correctly. It says on here,
Dang. This [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] got jokes. All right.
Type [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] man. Um, but I like that.
Let&#39;s keep it moving here.
Thank you guys for bearing with me
today. I&#39;m trying to be a little bit
more imperfect today. And I mean that
just in the sense like in my head I&#39;m
always like I got to do this. I got to
do it.
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I&#39;m tired of that. I&#39;m tired of
that voice.
Um what else do we have? Oh wow. Here we
go. A woman reported missing by her
family in Texas has been found living
amongst a lost African tribe
in the Scottish woodlands.
The kingdom of Kubala claimed they have
settled in a forest in Jedberg. with the
intention of reclaiming land that was
stolen from their ancestors 400 years
ago. Wow. And this lady is living there.
We live a very simple life of returning
to innocence. We return to nature. And
they got photos of them on here. They
grilling stuff like that. They grilling
up a lot of it looks like, you know, it
looks like goat and stuff like that. And
they vied out. They got like Zulu
warrior type of energy out here. and
kind of just chilling in tents. It looks
like kind of like REI tents.
But you got to be careful, man. I think
cuz a lot of I noticed this in my life.
If you take a woman to a certain
restaurant, they want that lifestyle.
They want that lifestyle.
Dude, I was dating a girl uh in LA for a
bit. I took her over there to um
Rainforest Cafe. Three weeks later, that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] moved to St. Thomas
and married a brother.
St. Thomas.
Oh, because I&#39;m out here getting that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] apps over here
at Rainforest Cafe. Be careful. You take
your lady to PF Changs and next thing
you know, she got all your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] all
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] chip chopped out at the house,
lamp shades and everything,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] She got ninjas on the uh
bookshelf.
She got a a stack of books and then two
ninjas just pushing against each side of
That&#39;s the kind of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] women will do
that, bro. You take them to PF Shangs
over there, you take a lady over there
to PF Shangs and next thing you know,
she got you brushing your teeth with a
damn bamboo stick or whatever. And
that&#39;s your money buying all of that.
So, you got to be careful.
You can easily lose a woman. Somebody
probably took this lady to a nice
restaurant of some sort. That&#39;s what I
would guess. Probably took her out to a
Caribbean dinner or Scottish meal or
cuz that&#39;s it. Missing Texas woman found
living in lost African tribe in
But yeah, man. That&#39;s what happened for
me, man. I took a lady to Rainforest

Anyway, what else we got? FDA warns
public not to eat possibly radioactive
shrimp sold at Walmart. Gang boy. The
Food and Drug Administration
is warning the public not to eat, sell,
or serve certain Great Value raw frozen
shrimp sold at Walmarts to possible
contamination with seesium 137,
a radioactive isotope. Gosh,
what is what is happening?
US Customs and Border Protection alerted
the FDA about possible seesium 137
detected in shipping containers at four
US ports.
If you have recently purchased raw
version shrimp from Walmart that matches
this description, throw it away.
Um, seesium is a soft, flexible, silvery
white metal that becomes liquid near
room temperature but easily bonds with
chlorides to create a crystalline
powder. According to the US
Environmental Protection Agency, damn,
that powder makes you want to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
stay around and see if you can have a
little bit of it. Couple of different
dates on Great Value brand shrimp. Those
are the issues. You You can check those
You know,
it honestly it sounds like this almost
just sounds like an origin story. I bet
because this is how the media works. I
bet this is just an origin story for a
new Marvel character. That&#39;s all it&#39;s
going to be.
This is how they do it. They put
something in the media that&#39;s not real
and then they create a character on it a
year later and bring it out. So, it&#39;s
all it builds in your head. That&#39;s a
psychology, bro. That&#39;s a psychology.
They have a planned
way to do it.
And that&#39;s what this is. I think this is
a new Marvel character. This is
Cocktail. That&#39;s who it is. Oh, that&#39;s
him. Cocktail.
Started out as an appetizer. Now he&#39;s a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] boss.
We ride here.
dude. I like that cocktail, bro. That&#39;s
a thing I&#39;ve been getting now at night
time. If I&#39;m trying to be on a date, I&#39;m
trying to be in love or something. Bam,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
I&#39;m getting you that.
That little shrimp cocktail, boy. G. You
just see them them [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] them tails
because that&#39;s not the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I don&#39;t
know where the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is, bro. And that&#39;s
fine. I don&#39;t need to see it, but you
just see them tails hanging off the edge
of that little cup they put them on.
Just like a couple stripper legs just
hanging off that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
And I like them, bro.
He was an appetizer. Now he&#39;s a boss.
One shrimp.
100 tons of seesium 137.
Uh, that could be it, man. China&#39;s new
pregnancy robot is set to replace the
human womb by 2026. I&#39;ve been saying
the womb is great. God made it. It&#39;s
beautiful. It&#39;s that original OG ski
portal from Christ, right? We get that.
And it&#39;s been amazing. But you knew we
were getting to this point where they
was going to outsource that womb, that
baby box, cuz big facts, dude. The womb
doesn&#39;t even have aircon, bro.
The womb doesn&#39;t even have aircon, bro.
And some of them the plumbing&#39;s even bad
in them or whatever. the baby&#39;s in there
and they got a dang little piss creek or
whatever rocking by or something cuz
mama&#39;s out there, you know, slurping too
many lemonades or whatever. Micheladas.
So that&#39;s the kind of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that pops off
around there.
So yeah, now it&#39;ll be great. You can
have a little robot, even a little
Chinese robot.
You your baby&#39;s in there, you put the
egg in there, you put the semen in
there. ask about even like a little
microwave door on that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] You put it
in thereoop.
Set that thing whatever you want. Mild
or whatever, you know, 8 months, 7
months. You could even do black and mild
or whatever. It&#39;s a little bit. It comes
out with that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Memphis crisp on
it. You feel me? They got all the
options now.
And then you and your wife can still
read or whatever, fight,
party or whatever, do a little tootude
or whatever. And your child is getting
uh organized, Chinese manufactured.
Really? I guess now that is true.
That may be that may be sketchy because
you you have to deal with some Chinese
manufacturing. It might get tariffed
when you take it out of the microwave. I
don&#39;t know. Trump might put that
freaking uh he might put that Chinese
extradition tax when you open that
microwave and get your child out. But
that&#39;ll be great, man.
You know, your wife your child&#39;s getting
raised in a robot. It&#39;s running around
and it can still complain. You can even
put a wig on. It can still be like a
wife if you need that energy. It can
still be like, &#34;I need some chocolate
pickles for me.
I&#39;m tired.&#34;
rub my feet.

in here. Hi, Theo. Big fan.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, I had a question for you. So, I&#39;ve
been seeing this guy for about two
months. Um, I really like him and I I
mean, I hope he likes me. Well, I&#39;m not
so sure because we&#39;ve been dating for,
like I said, about two months now, and
he hasn&#39;t kissed me yet. And I don&#39;t
know what to do. The other day, he put
his arm around me, and then he
apologized because it accidentally fell
down a little bit. a little bit lower as
my waist to go. Um, and so I can&#39;t he
hasn&#39;t kissed me yet. I can&#39;t tell if
he&#39;s gay or if he just don&#39;t like me,
you know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, there&#39;s other options, too.
Sometime people don&#39;t kiss you because
maybe they&#39;re sick.
Maybe they&#39;re sick. You ever thought of
that? This boy could be damn terminal
and you&#39;re over there. Wish he&#39;d kiss
me, you know, and he&#39;s over there just
hoping God gives him another afternoon.
Let&#39;s hear more. Uh, and I&#39;m typically
somebody that likes a guy to take the
reigns. So, this is kind of a sticky
situation for me, Theo. And I I just
wanted to get your advice on it. Much
love. You know, I watch the podcast
every week. Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well, thank you so much. I appreciate
that. I appreciate the warm words there.
And I&#39;ll say this straight up. A lot of
men out there
don&#39;t even do kissing anymore.
They do touching.
They do hand touching.
and Wiener. That&#39;s it. Kissing&#39;s from
damn 1800s or whatever. 1600s Scotland.
You see people kissing over there. Bring
something up. Let me see this.
Two people kissing in Scotland.
1700s. We&#39;ll split the difference.
Two people kissing in Scotland in the
Bam. Look at those mfers, dude. Good
day, sir. Oh, fancy the lips, lad. Oh,
you&#39;re kissing me, huh? Welcome to
Yeah. See, so look what I&#39;m telling you,
baby girl, is that things have changed.
You know, some guys, they don&#39;t do they
don&#39;t do kissing. They do hand touch.
They do waiter.
So, that could be what&#39;s popping.
And I think look, a lot of guys even
there&#39;s places there&#39;s articles now
where guys are going to Costa Rica and
getting their balls even taken off their
They don&#39;t want them. It&#39;s dumb. Look at
these ball. Like the wiener looks like
a, you know, like it could get hired by
Frontier Airlines. That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is looks
like it&#39;s going somewhere. The balls,
they just look, they look like a couple
of damn methadone homies sharing a
widemouth sleeping bag. That&#39;s all that
So, a lot of people are getting them
nuts just clipped right off. And that&#39;s
how you then you say to a lady, &#34;I&#39; got
it&#39;s all wien or no nuts.&#34; All dick and
no nuts, baby. God, that&#39;s And to a
woman, that sounds like a diet. That&#39;s a
skinny margarita of sex right there. All
dick and no nuts.
So, anyway, I&#39;m just telling you that
could be happening. And look, it&#39;s 2027
or whatever it is. Who gives a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Some people are calling from the future
now. People are on different time
continuums. What I&#39;m saying is this.
If you want to kiss them, kiss them.
Some woman the other night said, &#34;Come
over here and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] me, you little
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] honky. You fat fuck.&#34; Now, did I
go over there? No. It was late. I was
tired. But I admire that lady, okay? And
she will get my vote if she ever runs
for office.
But thank you so much. I would just
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] kiss him. I would [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] take
his hands and I would just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
I would just be like
or just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] write [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] me or
something on one of his arms and then he
reads it. He&#39;s like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] me and then
So that&#39;s actually that&#39;s illegal. I
think that&#39;s illegal.
So don&#39;t do that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] That&#39;s cheating
or whatever. Um
but yeah, but yeah, I think these these
days some men are too spooked. They all
the me too [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] everybody lobbed in
everything about that and now everybody
is you know every guy&#39;s a you know so
it&#39;s like now a lot of dudes the good
dudes are afraid they&#39;re afraid
you know and I&#39;ll say this too a lot of
they think the wiener is barely even a
wiener anymore in some circles of
some dudes they just think they got that
long [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] on
So, let&#39;s hear another call here.
As always, hotline 9856649503.
Uh, here we go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey, what&#39;s going on, Theo? My name is
Jake Smith.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Jake Smith. Thank you for the call,
Daddy. I appreciate it. Onward.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, I was really wondering if you had
some fatherly advice. I got my first
baby on the way. Um, here in less than a
week. I&#39;m about to find out. boy or
girl. So, we&#39;ll see. But, uh, a little
bit about myself, you know, I&#39;m a I&#39;m a
horseshoeer now. I live over here on the
countryside over on the West Coast.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, a horseshoeer. And I know what
that&#39;s called. That&#39;s called a um a
A frier. And I&#39;m going to read it right
now. Shout out to the friers out there.
A frier. A craftsman who trims and shoes
horses hooves.
I appreciate that. Calling in. My
sister&#39;s exhusband&#39;s
stepdaddy was a frier.
Cool business. I enjoy watching those
frier videos over there on Tik Tok. So,
let&#39;s hear it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, I used to work in zoos. used to take
care of lions and tigers, walk them on
leashes. And uh so I&#39;m used to the
little wild animals, but a wild child.
Now that&#39;s something a little different
out of my expertise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh man, I think you&#39;re going to be fine,
Daddy. You know, y&#39;all got that little
cuda gangster heading into the world,
and that&#39;s beautiful.
You know, I think that&#39;s beautiful.
You&#39;re going to be fine if you get a
handle of little uh working at a uh zoo.
You over there with the llamas, bro. And
the gerbles over there and them baby
bears, you know, and the hermit crab,
dog. I&#39;m a hermit crab. Be like,
whatever, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] We got We&#39;re
late for work, dog. That would be my
thing, bro, if I was a, you know, in
Mexico, they don&#39;t have any hermit
crabs, bro. Cuz everybody&#39;s got to go to
work, dog. We can&#39;t [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] That That
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] is a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] white [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bro. That
lazy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Oh, I&#39;m a hermit crab,
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Get off your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] ass, homie.
But yeah, dog, you&#39;ll be fine. You
babysitting animals and stuff. You got a
child on the way. I don&#39;t know. You&#39;re
going to be fine. But I say this, look
that child in his eyes
and share something good into his face
cuz that&#39;s all his eyes are just
absorbing what you&#39;re putting out in the
world. If every time you look at that
child, you&#39;re full of disappointment or
you&#39;re you&#39;re discouraged or you&#39;re
upset, then he&#39;s going to be upset. It&#39;s
going to live inside of himself, you&#39;re
casting a spell into your child&#39;s heart
every time you look at him. Now, I don&#39;t
mean you can&#39;t be get mad at them or
rough them up or [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tie their legs
in a knot and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] tickle them and
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] cover their body and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
sprinkles.
But just know
that you got to emotionally raise a
child. If you don&#39;t teach a child how to
feel, they don&#39;t then they going to
spend the rest of their life wandering
around how to feel, homie.
So, I&#39;m not preaching at you. I&#39;m just
wishing you guys the best in like kind
of an aggressive manner. I guess I&#39;m
kind of tired, but that&#39;s all right.
Praise God. Good luck with that child,
daddy. Um, here we go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yo, it&#39;s Emmy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s up, Emmy? Thanks for calling.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um, I&#39;ve been listening to the podcast
for a long time. Thank you so much. You
brighten up my day when I&#39;m hiking or at
work. Um, so I&#39;m currently going to
dinner with one of my ex-boyfriend&#39;s
mom. Um, I had kind of a silly question
like how like how do people feel about
furthering like a relationship with
somebody&#39;s parent when you&#39;re no longer
um you know me and this lady like we
really love each other and if I could
she would be my mom.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh yeah. Oh I can totally relate to
that. I think you know we all
you know I believe that we get pieces of
things of excuse me we get pieces of
relationships from different people you
like um there were moments in my life
where my brother was around or wasn&#39;t
around or was only so much available
because of just positive things in his
life or negative things in his life and
vice versa me for him and I would you
find somebody you get a piece of
brotherhood ood from somebody else.
You get a piece of fatherhood from
somebody else. You You know,
and and I really believe it is that way.
Oh, I had so many friends, mothers. I
would be friends with my friend&#39;s
parents. I was way better friends with
my friend&#39;s parents most of the time.
I&#39;d go over there and just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with
my friend just so I could go be around
her parents and freaking chill,
smoke. Sometimes my friend, my one of my
buddies moms, she used to tell us, &#34;Do
not smoke. If you guys get caught
smoking, you are [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] boys. I&#39;m going
to pull your [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] feet off of your
dick or whatever.&#34; She would say, some
thing, some old wives tail or whatever.
Then me and her would go smoke, dude,
while my buddy was doing some uh yard
work and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] So, it&#39;s like, yeah, I
had great relationship with my buddy&#39;s
parent, with friends parents. That was
so much fun. Girlfriend&#39;s parents for
sure. Oh, I got probably 50 of the first
hugs in my life from um
this young this this gal I dated. I got
probably 78 hugs from her mother. The
But yes, a lot of that&#39;s been a lot of
my life. So, yes, I think you can I
think you get bits and pieces and you
just attract yourself to people in life
and then sometimes those relationships
fade, but they don&#39;t fade like they
disappear. They just time changes, you
and things happen and sometimes like the
waves come and hit the beach and they
still are hitting the beach but the
water the actual actual wave that
originally hit the beach it&#39;ll kind of
move down the beach and so it&#39;s still
hitting the beach but it&#39;s moved on and
that&#39;s how those relationships are
sometimes in my life but I think they&#39;re
great and yeah and then we can do that
for other people too
you know nothing makes you feel better
than when you realize you have a moment
doing something with somebody and it
means a little bit of something, you
know, that&#39;s really beautiful, I think.
yeah, I mean, look, the love you can get
from other people&#39;s parents, it&#39;s just
bottomless. You feel me? Didn&#39;t think I
was going to say
I&#39;m feeling goofy today. Um,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hey Theo. Uh, this is Jake, uh, calling
from Illinois. What&#39;s up, Jake?
Illinois, baby.
That&#39;s what&#39;s up, papa. Let&#39;s hear more.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, anyways,
uh, I just needed some advice. I&#39;m, uh,
I work long shifts at work and I let I
let my emotions get the better of me
sometimes. And, you know, I uh, struggle
with a little bit of a alcoholic
And uh I know you&#39;ve probably talked
about this plenty of different times.
I&#39;ve listened to a lot of your podcasts,
but uh
it&#39;s really affecting uh my relationship
and uh the way I go about certain things
that upset me and uh and I I can&#39;t seem
to find that within me to get there.
My girlfriend that I&#39;m with is really
really seeing the bad side of me that I
don&#39;t want her to see. But anytime
anything really gets gets a hold of me
that I don&#39;t like
just just takes over and I&#39;m not the
same guy that I was.
Amen. Brother, look, I appreciate you
calling. I appreciate you letting me
know and just sharing with us what&#39;s
what&#39;s going on with you, you know.
Yeah, man. Anger has been
it&#39;s been a big problem of mine over the
You know, I think for one for me is
there&#39;s been a lot of rage from being
young and never got out.
I mean fury. I mean a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] fireball
that has endless fuel.
I think as an adult, you know, the
things that I noticed for me with with
anger was unrealistic expectations of
Unrealistic expectations of others. Um,
I was able to help figure that out
through recovery through 12step program.
Now, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve figured it
out and then it solved it. You know, at
different times when I&#39;ve been in and
out of the program, I&#39;ve like, you know,
had to do the steps again and realize
still a problem. Still a problem. But
yeah, unrealistic expectations,
expecting people to know things before I
told them
that was a big part of mine
of what caused me anger, you know,
because then I&#39;m,
you know, then I&#39;m just I&#39;m I&#39;m always
in conflict with everything.
So that that would be the only thing I
think I could recommend would be if you
go through 12 steps and you get through
and there&#39;s different programs. You
know, you mentioned some alcoholism and
I don&#39;t know if I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re
an alcoholic or not. You will know, you
know, you will it&#39;s only it&#39;s self
diagnosed,
but I do know there&#39;s other programs.
Um, if you aren&#39;t that still of the 12
steps and when you go through uh step
four and five and six, you really start
to figure out uh you know your character
defects and that can be a blessing.
You know, that&#39;s a gift. So anyway,
that&#39;s the only thing I could really
recommend that I have had experience
with. But yeah, I just would be so angry
and a thing like I couldn&#39;t I wish I
wanted to let that anger out. So the
crazy part is that anger will live in
you and then you let it out years later.
Sometimes the people you want to let it
out at, they&#39;re not even there anymore.
They&#39;re gone. They&#39;re ghosts,
man. So it just can feel
Like then it&#39;s almost like you [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
feel it again
cuz now you&#39;re angry that you know and
now you&#39;re having to deal with it again
that it&#39;s that not only was it in you at
one point cuz you were furious but now
it&#39;s in you again because it&#39;s trying to
get out of you.
It all comes to the surface, baby.
That&#39;s what I do believe. But look, man,
if you do something for yourself, then
something will be different. That&#39;s the
truth. If you do one thing, then
something,
you know, nothing changes if nothing
changes, baby. They say that. And it&#39;s
the truth, man. And if you heard that
and you didn&#39;t understand it,
then I&#39;m just going to say it again
slow. Not cuz I&#39;m trying to preach at
you. I just want you to hear it right.
Nothing changes
if nothing changes.
So when I&#39;ve when I&#39;ve heard that in my
life, it&#39;s been like, okay, how long do
I want to sit here
and not take an action but expect things
to be different? It kind of just
they put a mirror in front of me
sometimes. But all right, we got one
more call right here that came in. Um,
as always, the hotline 985-664-9503.
Let&#39;s see what we got.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s up, Mr. Von?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s up, brother? Thanks for calling.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh, yeah, man. I I just caught that [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
with Phoenix, dude. He&#39;s the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Uh, I
bet that was wild.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, dude. It was freaking wild, dude.
So, I&#39;ll tell you. So, um, well, he said
on the on the video that the on on on
the podcast, the reason he he that he
came on was because he&#39;d seen this video
talking about the, uh, stuff in the
Middle East and, um, which was
interesting to me because, you know,
some people don&#39;t want to think about
that or hear about it and I respect
that. Uh, but, uh, just that he said
that was interesting. But outside of
that, just to get to see him, you know,
he&#39;s had such a fascinating life, you
know, just from like if you if you just
go read up on his history, just
traveling in like kind of like a cultish
no school like youth and just this
Jack Carowak if they&#39;re at a it&#39;s almost
like Peter Pan goes to a Grateful Dead
type of show, you know, just um I don&#39;t
know, just so many different things and
then just like how talent t talented he
is you know and with him and I don&#39;t
even mean this like in it&#39;s talent for
sure but it&#39;s almost feels he&#39;s so
unique that it feels almost otherworldly
you know it feels uh
I mean
you know some actors they have feelings
you can relate to the feelings he&#39;ll
have feelings
and connect behaviors to them that some
of us have never even had. It feels like
so it&#39;s just
Yeah. So I just felt I just felt so
lucky and you know I wanted to be
gracious to him. I wish there was more
things we could have talked deeper about
but it&#39;s weird. You don&#39;t you don&#39;t want
people to think you&#39;re trying to just
talk about certain things or tough
times. Um,
and and you&#39;re trying to get to know
somebody and let them know that you&#39;re
trying to be as authentic as you can or
like, you know, that you don&#39;t have any
ill will, you know, I think,
you know, so anyway, I&#39;m kind of
overthinking it, which is like my ego
starting to flare up, but I thought it
was awesome, dude. Let me hear what more
what you had to say.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, you know, you&#39;re talented, too,
though. It&#39;s like you&#39;re sitting across
from just somebody in the business, I
reckon. But at any rate, you know, I do
enjoy his movies quite a bit and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, dude. No, I enjoyed it, man. I I
hugged him like three times in the
hallway and I was like, &#34;Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
dude. I think um, you know, I don&#39;t I
mean, I&#39;m Yeah, I&#39;m going to get married
to a woman one day or something, but I&#39;m
I can&#39;t hug him anymore.&#34; That was what
I realized. I was like, &#34;Oh, you can&#39;t
hug somebody you don&#39;t know.
somebody if they&#39;re nice to let you hug
them three times, but
you shouldn&#39;t keep hugging that person,
you know, especially if they&#39;re, you
know, it wasn&#39;t like it wasn&#39;t it was
fine, but it was definitely
there was there was no more hugs. You
could hear somebody say it. Nobody said
it, but you we both heard it, right? It
was that kind of thing. So, but no, he
was gracious and uh I felt lucky. And
that movie Edington, no joke, I think is
one of the neatest roles. Um, Austin
Butler&#39;s in it. Uh, Pero Pascal or Pesop
Pluma&#39;s dad, I think, is in it. I&#39;m not
even sure. Check it out. Anyway, thanks.
One more call right here. Let&#39;s get to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s up, man? This is Miles.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s up, Miles? Damn, that feels like
responsibility, dog.
Having that name G. Every time I go for
a jog, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I uh wanted to talk to you about your
brother. You know, I uh I recently got
close with my brother and he&#39;s 12 years
older than me. I swear I&#39;m not a
mistake, but uh we got close. We worked
together and and uh you know, we I just
he means a lot to me. And uh I see the
videos of you talking about your brother
there&#39;s a lot of things I want to say to
him and
you help me with that. We saw your
comedy show in Kansas City. You rocked
it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen my
brother cry till that moment. And uh you
know I think you kind of helped us come
together. But uh
my point is that I I love you, man. And
and keep doing what you&#39;re doing. And
you helped uh you help me. You helped
me, my brother, and and I hope your
brother&#39;s doing good. And I love you
guys. Peace out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, thank you, bro. That&#39;s nice of you
to say, dude. I think that&#39;s Yeah, M. I
appreciate it, dude. Thank you, bro. I
liked how at the end you said, &#34;I love
you guys.&#34; You know, you included my
brother even in that statement. Uh, I
thought that very thoughtful of you. Um,
yeah. You know, I think this goes back
even to that lady that called earlier
saying like, do we, you know, is it okay
to be friends with an old friend&#39;s
mother or an ex&#39;s mother? You know, it&#39;s
like we get pieces of relationships from
different people over time. Um,
you know, and some people fill in the
blanks for us while people um aren&#39;t
uh or can&#39;t be there.
Um, but yeah, having a brother, man,
that&#39;s just like I&#39;m so glad you guys
have gotten some moments. Oh, dude, a
moment a moment with my brother where I
know that he loves me or I&#39;m able to let
him know that I love him. I don&#39;t know
why that kind of stuff is so hard
sometimes for some brothers, but uh Oh,
yeah. Those are some of my favorite
things, you know? Like one day whenever
I die, that&#39;s the feeling I want to feel
when I&#39;m leaving. You know, I think
that&#39;s where I would go back to in my
head or my heart. Just go back to that
space, you know, cuz it&#39;s kind of like
as close as you will get.
And also, it&#39;s like having somebody
that&#39;s like cares about you, but also
can be like a detective because they
have the same clues as you inside of
So, being able to conversate and stuff
about those things and work things out,
uh, it&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m glad y&#39;all got to
do that. Thank you for coming, too, bro.
Thank you, bro.
Yeah. And you know, brothers, older
brothers, we don&#39;t get we should have a
special day for them. You know, they
they take a lot of the they take a lot
of the early heat in the world. They are
experimental for a lot of families.
They&#39;re like, &#34;Well,
let&#39;s see what happens with Gary.&#34; You
know, they send, you know, or they&#39;ll be
like helicopters. will have him in a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you know
but it but it gets different though when
you get on now sixth seventh child that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] ain&#39;t got no clothes on you
know Gary&#39;s got to wear a damn neck
brace full time he&#39;s got polio shots he
didn&#39;t have polio but they gave him so
many vaccines he&#39;s damn got it now he&#39;s
got you know
so I think it&#39;s
they do a lot to that early brother
you know and then we get to watch and
see like and learn in the landscape and
then you&#39;re always trying to be your
older brother but be yourself.
But yeah, thank you, man. I think I I
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what else to say
today about it.
But we should have a brother&#39;s day in
the world, you know,
and I know the brothers out there in
Philly are bottomless, dude. I know
that, you know, but I mean, we should
have a brother&#39;s day, man.
you know, where there&#39;s just like a
special time for brothers right there
because Indian dudes, they have it all
the time. You see a couple Indian
brothers and they holding hands and
everything. They over there putting
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] uh you know, zitzaki on each
other&#39;s necks and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Them dudes is
close as hell. But yeah, I&#39;m happy for
you, bro. And I&#39;m happy that you thought
today I&#39;m going to call a day. I&#39;m just
going to tell somebody else I love my
brother. It&#39;s kind of,
you know, it&#39;s it sounds bizarre to say
that, but it also sounds like one of the
most important things you could do.
Tell somebody, you know, I [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] love
my brother. Like, well, damn. All right.
You know, find a state where it&#39;s legal
or whatever. Trump will take it away.
Um, anyway, thank you for the call, bro.
I love your brother, too. And you tell
your brother. I said I&#39;m proud of his
Um, Dustin Porier&#39;s retired, but that&#39;s
okay. We never give up on him. We love
him. He&#39;s going to be out there fighting
crime. I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s going to
be that bayou Batman. You know that&#39;s
who he is, baby. James J. Bradica, the
Bayou Swamp Derella man. You know it.
We still got love. He&#39;s in our hearts
always. As we move forward, I will say
this one thing.
I bought myself something nice. We
donated to the Dustin Porier Foundation
and we got his final fight gloves and so
those are going to be um in the studio
and so he was one of our first guests.
He&#39;s given us a lot of support, but also
a lot of inspiration over the years, you
know, and uh and that&#39;s another place
right there I&#39;m thinking out loud where
sometimes you get a piece of a brother
or a sister or a mother or a friend or
something, you get it through somebody
else, you know, and that&#39;s a those are
gifts from God. Um so, and to anybody
out there who doesn&#39;t have a sibling or
they&#39;ve lost a sibling or something like
feel feel that channel of your sibling
through others. You know, I hope that
there&#39;s an opportunity for you to feel
that or that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a avenue
of grace that opens up in your life
today or this week where you get to feel
something like that cuz I believe that
people on the other side can feel them
when we talk to them. I believe they I
believe I bet not only do they feel it,
I bet they hear it in beautiful stereo,
you know? I bet all of our siblings and
family members could be at a big rave
somewhere and whenever we say something
to them from this side that the DJ&#39;s out
there and he just remixes the words, you
know, I love you Ronnie, you know, we
miss you, Jillian.
We miss you, Jillian.
But um anyway, praise God you guys be
good to yourselves. Thank you for
letting me be a part of your life. Sorry
I was kind of chatty today. Thank you
guys. Uh,
love y&#39;all
and thanks for loving me or thanks for
just listening even even if you hate me.
Just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] thanks for tuning in.
Praise God.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now I&#39;m just floating on the breeze and
I feel I&#39;m falling like these leaves. I
must be corner stone.
Oh, but when I reach that ground, I&#39;ll
share this peace of mind I found. I can
feel it in my bones,
but it&#39;s going to take
