I was in a lot of quarterback battles in
college. In fact, literally every single
dude that I lost a quarterback battle to
ended up being an NFL starter. My true
freshman, retro freshman, and red shirt
sophomore years, I backed up Cody Kesler
at USC. Those first two years, I lost
the battle to him. And then fast forward
to 2016, he&#39;s a third round draft pick
by the Cleveland Browns. That week two
of that year ends up being their
starter. My fourth year in college, my
red shirt junior year, I ended up
starting three games before getting
benched to Sam Darnold. Darnold just led
the Vikings to their best regular season
win total since 1998. But hey, I just
downed 1,400 ounces of caffeine just for
a YouTube video. So, who&#39;s stacking up
more dubs the past 12 months? Then in
2017, I transferred to Pit. I started, I
think it was four games before getting
benched for Ben Denucci. Ben was a
seventh round draft pick and ended up
starting games for the Cowboys. I
started the very next week that season,
ended up getting ACC player of the week,
and then the week after I got hurt. In
the final week of that season, the guy
that was technically starting ahead of
me was Kenny Picket. I also had five
head coaches in college. And I say all
that to say I know quarterback
competitions and the optics around them
very well. And by the time I&#39;m
publishing this video, most of the
quarterback battles will be announced.
Some will bleed into this season, but
the reality is the decisions to these QB
competitions will ultimately decide the
fate of all these teams. And with this
much at stake, why aren&#39;t the
conversations around quarterback battles
better? Ever since I started getting on
the media side of football, I&#39;ve noticed
a huge gap in how we talk about
quarterback battles behind the desk and
how they actually play out in reality.
You can take the same dude, put him
behind a desk, suit and tie, former
coach in the analyst role, and he&#39;ll
talk about a quarterback battle as if,
oh, you have two quarterbacks, you don&#39;t
have one. If it&#39;s equal, you got to go
with the young guy. But time and time
again, when we see it actually play out
in real life, see a lot of coaches elect
to go two quarterback systems. You
oftentimes see the game manager
quarterback beat out the guy with high
upside. The big difference between what
folks at the desk say and what folks
within the facility know actually
matters. And I&#39;ve talked about this
subject on a few podcasts, but I&#39;ve held
off on making a fulllength YouTube video
about it because the reality is I lost
almost all my quarterback competitions.
So, I don&#39;t want this video to come
across as if I&#39;m like spiteful or jaded.
I think I can avoid that and actually
put together a video for you guys that
I&#39;ve wanted to see every summer. Here&#39;s
what the video consists of. the ways
competing for quarterback one is just
like applying for any other job. The
ways it&#39;s unlike applying for any other
job. I&#39;ve told you guys this before. I
had five head coaches in college. So,
we&#39;ll dive into the best approaches that
I&#39;ve seen to the situation from coaches
and quarterbacks and the worst
approaches I&#39;ve seen. How quarterback
battles have changed in the 10 years
since I was in one and applying this new
understanding to the five quarterback
battles in college football in 2025 that
I find most interesting. First, let&#39;s
start off with the ways it&#39;s exactly
like job applications in the real world.
First, being a vibes guy or a
personality hire, it matters. EQ holds
weight. Like, if you&#39;re the shy,
reserved guy, coaches are going to look
at that as a disadvantage, all else
being equal. The opposite&#39;s also true.
If you&#39;re a vibes guy, everyone gets
along with you. Guys look to you. That&#39;s
going to be viewed as an advantage. When
I was battling it out with Sam Darnold,
I had a big advantage over him in that I
was one of the vocal leaders on the
team. And that&#39;s not just a, hey, I&#39;m
rahrh in workouts and all that. No,
coaches know that the best teams are
playerled. Coaches also know that most
guys don&#39;t like being vocal leaders or
most guys can&#39;t be vocal leaders because
they haven&#39;t earned that right. I was on
campus for 4 years. I had earned my
stripes. I had that credibility in that
locker room. So from a relationship
building standpoint and a implementing
your culture that matters. This is one
of the biggest factors the fan on their
couch underestimates. In fact, I just
watched it in the Netflix series with
Graham Mertz and DJ Lagway. Like it
never sells of like, oh, Graham Mertz,
he&#39;s a better leader than DJ Lagway. But
then time and time and time again across
different staffs, you frequently see the
fourth or fifth year guy, maybe get that
start, even if he&#39;s a game manager over
the hot shot young guy, championship
teams or player led. Now, let me be
clear. If I was significantly worse at
running the offense than Sam was, it
wouldn&#39;t have mattered. But when it&#39;s
close enough, you better believe that&#39;s
part of the edge that allowed me to have
the week one start. And I know there&#39;s a
USC fan watching this being like, &#34;Oh,
well, that was a dumb decision. We
should have started Sam.&#34; All right,
touche. I get that. I&#39;ll wear that on
the chin. But I promise you this year
you&#39;ll see it again. A veteran
quarterback who&#39;s a game manager type
guy beat out the hot shot young guy. And
it&#39;s because of this reason. Second way
a QB battle is like any other job
application. One position available
means only one position available. With
a lot of positions on a football team,
that&#39;s just not the case. You might have
a left tackle battle where the loser of
the left tackle battle might just turn
to left guard. Or even if they lose that
left tackle battle, you can still rotate
six or seven guys on the offensive line.
for a quarterback or someone trying to
get that job. If you don&#39;t get the job,
that means you&#39;re sitting on the
sideline. There&#39;s rarely a next time.
Third, talent gives you privilege.
Talent lets you get away with a lot. The
people that are making the decisions for
who gets this job can forgive a lot if
it&#39;s someone that has high upside, but
there&#39;s always a limit. And you hear
about quarterbacks needing to
recalibrate when they do hit that limit.
Tape Martell and Spencer Rattler are
some recent examples. The final way a
quarterback battle is just like any
other job application process everywhere
else. You can do a project perfectly and
still lose the job. Picture this.
Quarterback A and quarterback B are
competing. Quarterback A gets a play
call in practice and goes through the
progressions perfectly. The deep post
isn&#39;t there. Neither is the dig, so he
checks the ball down to the back and
does his job. Later, quarterback B gets
the same play call, but this time the
defense is in a different coverage. He
hits the deep post and the sideline goes
wild. The vibes are high. It&#39;s easy for
even some coaches, but definitely
players to be like, &#34;Ah, why can&#39;t
quarterback A make that throw?&#34; They
both did their job perfectly, but
somebody gets the edge. That can be the
look the defense gave you. Play call,
injuries, personnel decisions, like,
&#34;Hey, did quarterback B get receiver one
running the post and quarterback A got
receiver six running that post?&#34; Or just
a dozen other variables that come into
play. Just like when another candidate
has maybe a relationship that you don&#39;t
have, they get assigned a flashier
sample project than you did, or they
simply just caught the main interviewer
in a better mood that day. But as much
as I wish more people could relate to
losing out on a starting quarterback
battle at a division 1 school, there are
ways it&#39;s unlike any other gig. The
first is there isn&#39;t media coverage and
people writing stories about, &#34;Hey,
how&#39;s Bob&#39;s interview process going?&#34;
There was no reporter asking me about
how I felt about moving to the second
round of commercial real estate
interviews. Compared to my first
quarterback battle, my true freshman
year, I literally remember going off the
field every single day after practice,
getting in the ice bath, and scrolling
the timelines of beat writers to see
what they were saying about me. If I was
giving advice to a young quarterback, I
would say do whatever you can to not do
that. Definitely easier said than done,
but there&#39;s no denying that the media
coverage certainly makes this a bigger
deal. There are very few jobs in our
society where the interview process is
covered like that. The second way a
quarterback interview is unique, the
consequences. Not getting a job means
you have two choices. Move, oftentimes
across the country, or be okay with
likely never getting another shot. as
fans and media members. I&#39;m guilty of
this myself and honestly it gets worse
the older you get because there&#39;s more
and more football seasons where hey a
starter gets announced then you feel a
little bit of sympathy for the other guy
and then we just move on. Like the
reality is like that kid&#39;s not going to
have a big impact on the team and you
know you&#39;re focused on the starter. The
dude&#39;s just another guy on the team. But
for that kid it&#39;s his life. It&#39;s not
just that one or two years he&#39;s been
wearing the jersey maybe three or four
years. It&#39;s his entire life he&#39;s been
working for this moment. It means a
deep, painful self-reflection of whether
or not he can play this sport, this
position, or this coach on this team.
And before all of that, they have to
decide if they want to. And I totally
get it. Don&#39;t get me wrong. In today&#39;s
game, these kids are very well taken
care of. And there&#39;s a lot worse things
going on in the world. But my point is,
very few job application processes, if
you don&#39;t get that job, result in you
either moving or giving up entirely on
working in that industry. So, we&#39;ve
talked about how it is in the abstract,
but let&#39;s get into actual examples of
how QBs handle battles. First off, not
letting any sort of, I don&#39;t know,
uneasy vibes negatively affect the
locker room is key. When I look back on
all my quarterback competitions, the one
that was they were all good, but the one
that was honestly probably the best
vibes was me versus Darnold. And I think
it&#39;s cuz the roles were more clearly
defined even though we were battling. I
was the upper classman. I was more the
vocal leader. Darnell was the young raw
talent guy. compared to other battles
like and I get it when I was battling
Ben Denucci at pit he was the homegrown
guy and I was the dude transferred in to
try to take his job we were cool but it
wasn&#39;t like we were best buds similar
with me and Kesler again we were cool
genuinely but he was the upper classman
wasn&#39;t necessarily the biggest recruited
guy I was the young out ofate national
prospect guy five-star dude it was much
more competitive in those early days
once Kesler became the starter okay it&#39;s
a little bit different but Kayla let any
sort of just awkward vibes impact the
locker room. The best approach for
coaches I&#39;ve seen with quarterback
battles, be transparent. Don&#39;t play
telephone. A great example of this that
I&#39;ve seen recently came across it again.
The algorithm fed me it. It&#39;s Bill
O&#39;Brien with the Texans 2015. You can go
watch it on YouTube after you like,
comment, and subscribe to the channel.
Help your boy out with the algorithm.
But Bill O&#39;Brien, he&#39;s letting uh Brian
Hoyer and Ryan Mallet know who the
starting quarterback&#39;s going to be that
year. He&#39;s got those two quarterbacks,
the quarterback coach, and another
assistant coach in the room. He tells
everyone in the room at the same time
Brian Hoyer is starting why and how
close Ryan Mal was to earning the job.
Everyone&#39;s on the same page. There&#39;s no
kind of wishy-washy one guy gets one
message, one guy gets another message.
Everyone&#39;s moving forward with the same
understanding. Klay Helen did the exact
same thing in 2016. He had Darnold and I
in our postspring meeting come into his
office at the same time and delivered
the same message to both of us at the
exact same time. There was no, &#34;Hey,
Darnold got one message.&#34; I&#39;m thinking,
&#34;Hey, what&#39;s he telling Darnold and I
got a different message?&#34; And Darnold&#39;s
thinking, &#34;Hey, what Helton tell
Brownie?&#34; He looked at both of us and
said, &#34;I got two NFL starting
quarterbacks on our roster.&#34; Jokes on
me, cuz that didn&#39;t happen for me. It&#39;s
obviously happening for Darnold. But he
said, &#34;I got a great problem. I got two
quarterbacks I like. Only one dude can
play. I got a tough decision to make.
We&#39;re going to let the spring ball
battle head into fall camp.&#34; compared to
I had a different coach that publicly
said it was a quarterback battle, but
then I got word that he was watching
film with one of the other quarterbacks
on their own, like separate hours. And I
was like, I&#39;m not getting one-on-one
film watching time with the head coach.
Is this really a quarterback battle? To
me, your message can lose credibility if
that&#39;s the case. I&#39;ll start with a
personal approach that I wish I could
have changed. I remember my first
quarterback competition, my true
freshman year. I would get off the field
in spring ball, go in the ice bath, and
immediately open up Twitter and scroll
to see what the beat writers had written
about the quarterback competition that
day. As a young true freshman making
mistakes, oftent times the reviews were
not positive. And for a young five-star
guy, that was the first time that I
gotten real criticism about my play. And
I used to think that I was better than
that and it wasn&#39;t impacting, but it
definitely was uh was eating at me. I
wanted so bad to play well. So then you
got good articles written about you. So
then your friends and family back home
when they&#39;re looking for updates, see,
hey, how&#39;s Max doing? That&#39;s the good
stuff. So much easier said than done.
Luckily, I grew out of that as I got
older and more competition&#39;s under my
belt. But that&#39;s tough and it&#39;s probably
worse now because of the sharability of
social media now. Unlike the ones I&#39;ve
talked about thus far, I got perspective
on this bad approach once I got into
broadcasting. The approach is coaches
leaning on stats from practice to try to
be more objective in these competitions.
I don&#39;t think that bears good results.
It just gives coaches an out when mom
calls and says, &#34;Why is Joey not
starting?&#34; Cuz stats disregard those
variables I mentioned earlier that are
outside the quarterback&#39;s control. In a
game, you can be sure you&#39;re getting the
other team&#39;s best. In practice, coaches
and players are trying different things,
schemes, lineups. I don&#39;t like using
completion percentage as just a
catch-all term for why, hey, one dude&#39;s
running with the ones. A dude that&#39;s got
72% completion percentage, but he&#39;s
missed two big touchdown shots down the
field, is not as good as a dude who&#39;s
had 62% completion percentage, but he&#39;s
pushing the ball downfield. Second, QB
is a subjective position. How a guy
makes his team feel is not the most
quantifiable metric, but just because
it&#39;s tough to measure doesn&#39;t mean it
should be ignored. Another approach of
coaches that I am not a fan of. Don&#39;t
say there&#39;s a quarterback competition if
there&#39;s not a competition. Pete Carol
championed the world competition and
then every other coach for the past 15
years has hid behind that word. I get
that it&#39;s a tactic to inspire a guy to
develop. I just think that if you&#39;re 80%
sure on a starter, go all in with him.
And I get it. You like have to say
there&#39;s a competition so then the number
two guy doesn&#39;t transfer and number
three thinks that he has some backdoor
shot when he calls his mom and dad back
home that he might play. But it&#39;s just
let&#39;s call a spade a spade. It&#39;s
disingenuous when a lot of those coaches
get on the table and say, &#34;We&#39;re giving
every dude a chance to compete.&#34;
Actually, that&#39;s not disingenuous.
What&#39;s disingenuous is when we say,
&#34;Yep, it&#39;s a quarterback competition.&#34;
And now that I say that, coaches have
altered their vocab. They now say like,
&#34;We&#39;re giving every guy a chance to
compete.&#34; And not a, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s a
quarterback competition.&#34; Subtle
difference, but big difference. Coaches
behind behind the word competition when
I guarantee 80% of them, 85%, they know
who their starter is going to be
probably before fall camp starts. Moving
on to the unk portion of this video. You
know, back in my day, nah, but for real,
the portals changed everything. If
you&#39;ve called a competition and it&#39;s not
one, there&#39;s consequences. Guys are not
sticking around if they don&#39;t think they
can win the job in 2 years. My story of
spending 3 years behind a dude as a
five-star prospect is rare, almost
unheard of nowadays. But on the flip
side, coaches have zero incentive to
name a starter after spring ball. Like,
remember those days? It was normal to
have a starting quarterback named after
spring ball. So then the team knew their
leader, had an end of summer camp and
fall ball, the whole deal. But nowadays,
if coaches do name a starter, the other
dudes transferring in that May window.
Another huge way things are different
that I don&#39;t see talked about as much,
scheme. 15 years ago, pro style concepts
were super complex, and that favored old
guys. It was incredibly difficult 15
years ago for a true freshman to come
in, learn the scheme, get up to speed,
and beat out the old guy. in a lot of
these schemes where literally just
getting in and out of the huddle was one
of the hardest things for a young
quarterback. The terminology has been
dumbed down which helps younger
quarterbacks get on the field faster.
All right, so I hope that gave you guys
a better idea of what a quarterback
battle is actually like, how it impacts
the team, and my perspective on them.
And with that, let&#39;s get into the five
QB battles I&#39;m most excited to see how
they play out this fall camp. First,
Alabama. They&#39;ve got a defense with
first round talent at all three levels.
They have the second best wide receiver
in the country. And Ryan Grub is back
with his old boy Kayn Dbor after a year
as the Seahawks OC. The only missing
piece in Tuscaloosa is a quarterback.
Dude, if Jaylen Milro came back to the
Tide, they&#39;d be everyone&#39;s offseason
pick. But Milro moved on to the
Seahawks, funny enough. And so they&#39;ve
got Ty Simpson, the red shirt junior.
He&#39;s got 50 attempts under his belt, but
no touchdowns and no interceptions. was
the number three quarterback in the
class of 2022. Austin Mack, I know a lot
of Husky fans were really excited about
him before he transferred to Alabama.
Redsh shirt sophomore, 6&#39;6, 235, very
limited career stats, not as high of a
recruit as Tai Simpson. And then you got
Keenan Russell, the number two overall
quarterback prospect in the class of
2025. True freshman. We&#39;ve talked about
the difficulties of a true freshman
coming in and playing, but it has
happened. In fact, the last Alabama true
freshman that had a coming out party
early on in the season was against me,
Jaylen Herz. Bottom line though, I like
Austin Mack just from like what you
read, but I think Tai Simpson wins the
job. Moving on, who will lead the
Calgorithm in 2025? This might be a
super niche take, but uh the stakes of
this decision are high in 2025. Head
coach Justin Wilcox can&#39;t afford a down
year. Devin Brown waited his turn at
Ohio State and reading between the lines
they told him he wouldn&#39;t get a shot at
Ohio State. Geron I&#39;m still working on
your last name the true freshman at Cal
was committed to Cal then signed with
Oregon was there for the Rose Bowl and
said no I&#39;m going to go back to Cal.
Obviously he went back to Berkeley think
that he could play right away. Bottom
line I think Will Cox needs to win right
now. I think it&#39;s going to be Devin
Brown. And who knows maybe that dude can
play. I mean Ohio State&#39;s had a loaded
QB room. Brown was a big recruit. But if
Brown does start and Cal starts losing
games, you run the risk of losing the
highest rated QB recruit that Will Cox
has ever gotten as Cal tenure. Stick it
out west or kind of out west. OG Pack 12
school. Who&#39;s going to be coach prime
signal caller in 2025? This is a lowkey
big season for Colorado. If they can
compete in the Big 12, it&#39;s a sign that
the program was not just about two guys,
both of which have their numbers
retired, one of which is ridiculous that
his number was retired. So, whoever&#39;s
under center is going to have massive
pressure to make sure that the Buffs
don&#39;t have a down year. Kaden Salter is
the vet. I was kind of surprised
Colorado got him just given, you know,
how big of a recruit Julian Lewis was.
He&#39;s got tons of experience, 702 career
attempts, almost 6,000 yards, 56 TDs,
seven interceptions with 2,000 yards
rushing to go along with that. Julian
Lewis, big recruit, number six
quarterback in the country this past
year, 611 190 true freshman. Dion took
them both to media days. If you took a
true freshman to media days, it&#39;s one
thing to take both. That&#39;s weird. It&#39;s
another thing to take a true freshman.
That&#39;s weird. But that&#39;s also a sign I
think Julian Lewis ultimately starts.
Now, let&#39;s talk about the $10 million
true freshman. Michigan leveraged alumni
base to flip Bryce Underwood&#39;s
commitment from LSU to the Wolverines.
They kept the number one recruit in the
country in state. And that pressure is
going to be insane. But there are, and I
feel like Michigan fans might forget
this, there&#39;s other dudes in the room.
Davis Warren&#39;s still in that room. And
Michigan fans would probably hate to
hear this, but you know, he started a
game. He could start again, but I don&#39;t
think it&#39;ll happen. They never went to
Jaden Davis when things got bleak last
year, so I doubt it happens this year.
He&#39;s out. But Mikey Keane, the Fresno
State transfer, he&#39;s not transferring to
Ann Arbor just to, hey, twirl your
thumbs and have a good time. I think he
pushes Bryce Underwood for uh for that
starting role. I will say though, with
schools like Michigan or USC, you never
know if a kid gets at a certain point
where he&#39;s like, you know what, kind of
want that uh Michigan business school
grad degree. kind of want that USCBA. We
never talk about that, but it&#39;s very
much a factor. Bottom line, after the
success of DJ Lagway and Dylan Raayola
last year and just again all the
pressure around Bryce Underwood, I think
the dude starts kind of respect that
he&#39;s number 19, too. That&#39;s the worst
quarterback number and that dude&#39;s just
going to rock it. Now to the other
sideline in the game this year, Ohio
State. Whoever wins this competition
gets to throw to the most talented
receiver group in the country. It&#39;s
between five-star transfer from Alabama,
Julian Sam, or the pride of South
Dakota, Lincoln Kenoltz. Vegas thinks
it&#39;s Sam, but Kenol could steal this
one. He is more athletic and physically
imposing. What sticks out to me is at
least from everything you read, two
totally different skill sets, which
maybe of all these I could see a two
quarterback system here, possibly week
one. At the end of the day, it&#39;s got to
be saying no because worst case
scenario, I think he becomes just a
solid game manager and you just play
point guard and get your playmakers the
ball and then as the season progresses,
maybe he grows into being a more dynamic
quarterback as they make their title
run. But man, I don&#39;t miss being in
quarterback competitions, but they are
fun to cover on the other side of the
desk. But hey, if you like this video, I
