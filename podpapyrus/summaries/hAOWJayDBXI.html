The following contest is sponsored by
Htown Racing and is a doors, ladders,
and chairs match for the SSW Women&#39;s
Championship.
[Applause]
Thank you.
Introducing first to my left the
challenger
healing from the subspace division.
We&#39;re representing
She is the cutie with the goggles.
She is a lightning in a battle.
[Applause]
to say the crowd is firmly behind Sandra
[Applause]
Maserati making it hard to make. and her
opponent to my right
from Las Vegas, Nevada. She is the
reigning and defending FSW women&#39;s
the female with attitude,
[Applause]
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a person in this
building that doesn&#39;t want Sandra Moon
to fulfill her dream and win that title
I want to see her win. Yeah, but
everything she&#39;s been through, this is
her night. Azeradis
made and wa
made it her mission to make sure the
people in this arena never get what they
She hasn&#39;t had the easiest life herself.
She&#39;s fought for everything she has. She
sees wrestling as an outlet to turn her
life around. But as she used wrestling
to turn her life around, her ego got out
of control. And we got a fight.
[Applause]
They started out with their best shots.
And you know what? They&#39;re not waiting.
Both women go to the outside to take
this match up a level.
No hesitation out of either competitors.
Let&#39;s just start with Why not? Let&#39;s go.
That cannot feel good in my hands. No.
Oh, look at the chairs already bending.
And Sandra Moon trying to throw the
chair, but Maser Oh no. Great setup out
of Sandra. Sends Maserati to the
outside. That&#39;s not a safe spot to be
[Applause]
Coupe with
Sandra Moon putting her body at risk.
Going for another one to take down her
arch enemy.
Do you want to see it again, Jake? I
want to see it. I always love it.
Sandra Moon catches it in the side of
the head. It looks like Maserati
swinging for the fences.
[Applause]
Oh, it spikes her top of her head. It
looks like landed right on the chair. Oh
my god.
First time ever match
ladders a chairs the women&#39;s
championship here at FSWW.
But this match almost kind of fits
Maserati strategy, her way of pro
wrestling than it does Sandra Moons even
more cuz Maserati will use anything to
get a victory. And when the ladders,
chairs, and doors come into play, I have
a feeling Maserat is going to be extra
dangerous. And my thing is these two
hate each other so passionately. And not
only do they have no concern for each
other&#39;s safety, they have zero concern
for their own safety. No, it&#39;s going to
be a high-risisk matchup. Oh my god, she
going for that doctor bomb on the floor.
This is going to be the epitome of high
risk, high reward.
That high reward FSW
[Applause]
shot. Maserati feeling confident now.
That chair turned everything around for
her. That chair also has been turned
inside out.
Three years ago when the FSW women&#39;s
title was introduced in his company,
these two were in their first
championship match
came out victorious on that night. But
Maserati was the first one of these two
homegrown talents to achieve the glory
and win the bout.
And that that is why this rivalry runs
so deep. It&#39;s personal and it&#39;s for
getting yourself to the top of the
[Applause]
Choking away at her and the referees
can&#39;t do anything.
Feel like she&#39;s made it very clear that
pushing that point.
[Applause]
Got to wonder if the fans are getting
underneath the skin.
Normally she doesn&#39;t let him get to her.
That&#39;s got to mess with your mind at
this point. Especially when you know in
some ways. Yeah, you&#39;re right. Usually
she feeds off everyone wanting her to
lose. She drinks the tears of the fans.
Yeah. She drinks FSW
fans tears. You&#39;re right.
Yeah. It&#39;s not igenic, but it fuels her.
Swings her leg around and connects right
to the midsection of Sandra.

other side. Look at Sandra twists

She ate that chair for dinner.
might be dead. So, this is a great
opportunity for Sandra to go for that
belt. Yeah, she&#39;s got to get a ladder in
the ring and go up,
which But is she focusing on the belt or
is she focusing on the bench? I want to
know where her head is. I have a feeling
coming in this match, she was focused on
the belt, but the minute her she locked
dive in with Maserati, revenge was the
first thing that came into her head
[Applause]
center of that rail.
You know what? Not a bad strategy. Get
knocky out far away from the ring. gives
you an easier time to climb the ladder
and win it.
But I don&#39;t know if something like that
is running through Sandra&#39;s mind at the
moment. Maserati&#39;s busted open.
Oh my gosh. She is. Wow.
Wow. Shows you how far this has come.
Blood has finally been drawn
in this feud.
I mean, Maserati hit that chair so hard.
What is she going to do? Trying to Oh,
send her into the steel.
Spending a lot of energy trying to lift
Maserati. Didn&#39;t get everything she
wanted out of but Maserati busted.
I mean, this is not bloody.
that much
Sandra in control except the punishment
is about right now. This is pure hatred
fuel revenge.
You can&#39;t blame her for everything
that&#39;s happened.
Not everybody&#39;s not everybody&#39;s cup of
tea in a match reach these level of
violence this level of violence. But
it&#39;s come to this and with good reason.
The drops are back first on the edge of
the ring. Mostly the frame of the ring
is some wooden steel. Not a good landing
for Miles, especially as she&#39;s suffering
this level of blood loss.
Are we bringing the door into the
equation? The fans are promising doors,
chairs, letters, and I think these two
are delivering that promise.
[Applause]
Sandra getting that door in the ring
not going to give a damn about Maserati
reliving her mind everything Maserati&#39;s
done to her over the last year plus a
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] door.
We have never seen go to these lifts.
What is this trend with doors? This is a
thick door. This is the tiny little
apartment door. We&#39;re all looking for
that Lowe&#39;s sponsorship. So,
Oh, you guys are Office Max people.
Sandra Moon slugging away on that open
wound of the champion.
Walmart who had Office Max prices in the
80s in the 2000s.
What are we saying about Rob Dimension?
Oh, and and Maserati&#39;s got to be in a
different dimension right now. Busted
open. Had those fists just driven in
that open wound. And that door awaits
Oh, she catches herself.
Trying to make that door forbidden for
herself. But no, Sandra.
You know what? Not all the door broke
guy. Jagged piece of the wood might be
cutting them open.
as they landed into that.
When do you know this? Maserati has not
let go of her yet. Now she does. Little
bit of space.
That blood just running down her face.
As we mentioned, everything bad about
Maserati, she will do whatever it takes
to keep the title.
That is her prize possession.
Now we got it. That&#39;s the ladder. That&#39;s
the ladder that&#39;ll move.
Not sure about the other lads on the
outside. They&#39;re just used to try and
hurt somebody.
This is the one.
This is the stairway to the goal.
Particularly tough especially. So she
needs that feeling that she&#39;s going to
get up that high.
You got to wonder if blood loss is
messing with her brain a little bit. Can
she keep a clear mind having taken the
abuse she&#39;s taking usually
now she&#39;s barking orders in the referee
you know what though for the competitor
safety I&#39;m all for the referee holding
that steady I feel like safety&#39;s out the
know at this point. Jake, the fans
sending a warning signal to Sandra Noon
to let her know she has to get back in
the game here
on that side of the
blue thunderbomb
again. No pinballs, but will that take
Maserati out long enough to allow Sandra
to send up to the top?
Sandra&#39;s feeling the effects of the
German through the door.
Does she have enough strength and power
to get up there?
Sandra Moon
[Applause]
moving slow. Maybe a little too slow.
After being put through that door,
everybody would be moving slow.
Sandra doing her best. This is the This
is the fastest speed she can get up at.
Her body can only take so much.
[Applause]
Maserati with knew she wasn&#39;t going to
be able to pull Sandra off. She knew
she&#39;d need that little something extra.
Grabs the steel chair and nails Sandra
Moon with it.
Releasing it, too.
That causes even more damage rather than
holding on. That is just the passion
between these two.
Hey, we are seeing a banger of a main
event. But
at what point does the violence end? Is
it going to escalate? It&#39;s It&#39;s going to
end when one of these two can&#39;t
continue. That&#39;s how a match like this
You got hatred. You got pride on the
That is how much this
Oh, these these two will shorten their
careers to shut the other one up and
walk out with a title. They&#39;re going to
only one of these two are going to
survive this match. Think about it.
Walks out.
She&#39;s going to be a bigger nightmare
than her. Amy Christians, let&#39;s go. Will
Santa get another chance or who in the
back is going to step up and find the
She&#39;s got another door here.
It&#39;s a very patriotic door.
[Applause]
Trying to take deep, but I don&#39;t know if
Moon&#39;s got an error.
She&#39;s still down.
Still down. Maserati, given the amount
of time Sanders went down, Maserati
could have climbed up the ladder and
held on her championship.
Oh, call her a little girl.
That&#39;s been part of the trash talk out
of Maserati, claiming that she&#39;s a real
woman and Sandra is still a little girl
playing in her dream, not being at her
level, not the serious competitor that
she is. And Sandra&#39;s proving that&#39;s not
Drops her face first on the ladder.
Maserati&#39;s had a great year coming out
of this pandemic. Very FSW. Recently
made her run in this division held her
own up there against I believe it was
the postul
underrated for the last years.
But and I&#39;ve seen it because Mike is
here champion. Speaking of under
Brandon, never underrate how bad having
a steel chair slammed into your back
hurts. It feels good. Trust me. Been
Sandra Moon will not back down. She&#39;s
heard enough from Maserati.
mean, I hope we have medical on site
ready to go cuz these two are going to
the narcissistic side of Maserati coming
out or she just Sandra Moon

everything.
That&#39;s right, man. That&#39;s what being a
champion&#39;s about. Doing it yourself.
Something you really should be able to
relate to.
Help several people. Strella obviously
being prominent of recent times.
That&#39;s the thing. Even Maserati&#39;s got to
be a little disoriented. He&#39;s taking a
[Applause]
What a diva.
That is not a safe. That is not going to
be safe for anybody.
Oh, he is. She&#39;s not above bringing the
people to tears.
Make them feel like nothing at this
point. Maserati.
No matter what happens in this match up,
Sandra [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] whether she goes down or
not, she&#39;s going to go into this fight
defying as hell.
These two are just taking it to the max.
What do we got coming up here? Physical
is how they wanted it.
I don&#39;t know if this
Sandra Moon was just playing Sandra
Moon. Yeah, she&#39;s dead weight at this
Honestly, I think it was the chair
that&#39;s been bent up on the back of
Sandra Moon that wasn&#39;t able to support
the door.
But she still found a way to make it
work. And that&#39;s thinking on your feet.
I mean, it&#39;s a door. You can hurt people
a lot of ways with you. Considering the
hell that you&#39;re going through, I don&#39;t
know how
with the presence of mind to put this
together. But bless the country.
[Applause]
Through help by water, Maserati is going
to make her game plan work.
She does not accept failure.
and Marotti says it&#39;s finally over.
But she doesn&#39;t see Sandra Moon.
See that power bomb?
Come on with a power bomb
from when we thought she was going to
win the championship.
Go get up there. Take the title. He&#39;s
not directly be underneath the title,
but isn&#39;t it? But does it matter?
You&#39;re a winner and newly
Women&#39;s Champion
Maserati&#39;s cockiness got to her and it
finally dropped her in the end.
The dream of a young student who came to
the FSW
Academy to the goal to be a professional
wrestler is now on top of the world as
the FSW women&#39;s champion.
Everything Sandra Moon has battled
Every obstacle, every single time she
was told to give it up and move on, it&#39;s
now worth it.
The entire women&#39;s locker room is on
the new champ. I don&#39;t know if Son
understands, but the target is on her
Thank you so much.
In my four years, I don&#39;t even think I
could imagine what this moment was like.
[Applause]
I spent so many hours, nights, mornings,
days, just parts of my life and my
childhood growing up in this place. And
to finally be able to say that I&#39;m the
women&#39;s champion. There
there wasn&#39;t even a woman&#39;s when I
and it was never about who was first or
who would come out on top or who was
better because I must give it up to
Maserati. Without this, without me, it
couldn&#39;t have ever been done.
[Applause]
To have a show dedicated to all the
wonderful women in this the talent all
across the world and to be able to hold
something that was held by such amazing
women before me. since Heather, since
Taio, since Lacy,
since Maserati. It&#39;s it&#39;s such an honor
to be able to have hope to hold
something that is just so beautiful.
Something that we all created together.
And I just thank you all for being a
part of this moment and showing your
Great words coming from Sandra Moon, our
new champ. And just weeks ago, I
wouldn&#39;t have able ever been able to
think that I would be in the headsp
space that I am. Weeks ago, I didn&#39;t
even know if I was cut out to be a part
of this. And without my people,
Jody, Adriel, Laz, Chris Mounts, and my
beautiful family. Without you guys, my
my support is I wouldn&#39;t be anything
without you.
[Applause]
Just thank you for all your support and
I hope to see you all very soon.
[Applause]
Well said from our new women&#39;s
