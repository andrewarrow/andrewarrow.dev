Where would Sher be in 2025?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We might find out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As if.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Batgirl.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; George Clooney was so kind to me and um
just such a big brother vibe and lovely.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe,
maybe not.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What advice would you have for that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just want to hug her and protect her.
Hi, I&#39;m Elisia Silver.
What if you use that? I&#39;m Elisia
Silverstone and this is my ET
retrospective.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is going back to 1992.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was wondering if I could borrow your
bio notes from yesterday.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I had something she wanted.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you remember about that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I
I can I feel I can feel the memory of
being there right now watching it. Fred
Savage is so cute and Fred Savage got my
phone number, but it was the days of fax
machines. So my phone number was our
house phone number, right? And it was a
fax machine for my dad&#39;s work. So when
he called it went straight to fax, so he
thought I gave him a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fake number. So that didn&#39;t work out for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do you remember auditioning?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I auditioned a million times
because I actually auditioned for a
different part
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on the same show.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. So, you uh busy Friday night?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe,
maybe not.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What was it about this that you knew
this is what I want to do? Acting is for
me. I was a theater nerd and um my dad
took me to see a lot of theater in the
West End being that we were my parents
were English and so we would go to see a
lot of theater and I was interested in
drama class and things like that and I
think I was just interested in the
therapeutic aspect of it seeing I I
suppose I found my people that they were
more interesting. What advice would you
have for that girl? I just want to hug
her and protect her.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is one year later,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1993, The Crush. Oh, love this one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I auditioned 100,000 times and then
finally I heard I had it and I was going
crazy cuz I didn&#39;t believe it. It took a
long time, you know, the process. But
once I heard I was very happy. Why is
she cooler than I am now?
What are you doing here?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Missed you at the show. Did something
come up?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Go on, get out of here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s a scene where I I barge into the
his He&#39;s at a work event and I barge in
and I grab him and I slap him and he
throws me up against the wall and it&#39;s
so violent and she&#39;s insane. I love how
crazy it was and I don&#39;t know what I was
channeling but I can imagine some things
but um but it was just fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What was the reaction when this came out
and and you know now you&#39;re on the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t remember the reaction of
specific. I think that the whole thing
was just happening to me and I was so
young that I don&#39;t know if you know how
to like it&#39;s just what&#39;s happening right
and so there&#39;s no aware I I I think it
was all very overwhelming for sure
um but I think the reason I got into all
this was because I loved acting so that
to me is what the journey I was on and
this was a very exciting role because I
got to really I mean it was a juicy part
the crushes very juicy part and um you
know cutting those lemons.
I like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the choices that I made are and what
came out of me makes me giggle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are you doing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Making lemonade.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Want some?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m chopping the lemons like a mad
woman. Like I&#39;m going to murder someone.
And then he looks up and I&#39;m just like I
think I say, you know, want some
lemonade or I made some lemonade. Want
some? And it&#39;s just so uh manic and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so where did this come from in this
15-year-old, you know? It&#39;s just
interesting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, Carrie was really wonderful. I
mean, when I first got there, I didn&#39;t
even realize how nervous I was, but
every day I was he was so good for me
there. I would have died if he wasn&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What advice from Carrie do you remember?
He took care of me and and um and he
tolerated my I remember we had to do
this kiss scene and you know he&#39;s in his
I think he was in his 30s and I was 15
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and or just turning 16 and so we did
this kiss and then I immediately had all
these feelings of like oh he&#39;s my
boyfriend right? He must be because he
just kissed me just like Darien thought
in the movie. I didn&#39;t start stalking
him, but I did think that. Not that that
was not realistically, but there&#39;s some
part of you that doesn&#39;t know how to
separate that, which I don&#39;t know if
I&#39;ve ever gotten over, but but um but
there was this feeling of um I remember
I went to his trailer and I said, &#34;Was
that okay?&#34; And he was just like, &#34;Yes.&#34;
He was he was but he didn&#39;t he was not
it was just so big brother.
Well, this is our next project. Same
year, 1993,
your music video era.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Steven Tyler looks so amazing with his I
mean, he&#39;s just that scream he does with
his mouth is incredible. And Steven
Dwarf was such
everyone had a crush on Steven Dorf. He
was just uh dripping in
ladies man. I didn&#39;t know who Aerosmith
was. You know, I was 16 orif I was 16
and uh but the people that worked around
me, they knew who Aerosmith was and they
were like, &#34;Yes, go.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ew. Get off of me.
As if.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, moving along to 1994.
Still as popular today as ever.
Who&#39;s that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that me and Breen? It
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What are we doing? That&#39;s so cute.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t remember Brean and I having that
kind of bond at all. Like, that&#39;s so
sweet that we&#39;re sitting there with our
heads together on the floor. He needs to
see that. Shar&#39;s a very happy girl.
She&#39;s happy, happy, happy, happy. Very
unusual. And um she goes around trying
to please everybody. And she just has
that. She&#39;s very motherly nature to take
everybody under her wing and she
sometimes does things that she doesn&#39;t
realize it&#39;s not very much for their
benefit. She thinks it is. She&#39;s
controlling but not in a bad way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Did you know then though what a cultural
sensation this would be all these years
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s no way anyone could have known
the cultural phenomenon that this was.
There&#39;s just I don&#39;t know how you could.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What is the most quoted clueless line
you get?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. Oh, I feel like people say
all kinds of things. I mean, of course,
as if and yeah, I think as if is the
main one. I say some of them in my head
sometimes. I don&#39;t. And that&#39;s because
of other people having said them and now
they&#39;re oops, my bad comes into my mind.
I don&#39;t really say it out loud. Maybe to
my son.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oops, my bad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where would Sher be in 2025?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. We might find out. Are you
asking me about the potential? potential
reboot or where you would like to see
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Okay. So, where we are at with that
is that it&#39;s very early stages and I&#39;m
obviously excited. I never thought that
that was something that I would ever do
because I wouldn&#39;t want to mess up this
thing that we all love so much. And so,
we will do our very best to honor the
original movie that we love and also
bring something new to it. That&#39;s the
goal and I believe we will execute that
goal. You know, I can&#39;t wait to step
back into Sher&#39;s skin and her fancy
designer shoes that will be gently used.
Of course, duh. But in terms of what
she&#39;s doing and what we know, that&#39;s all
mom&#39;s the word until it happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; See, I&#39;m outie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bye.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Using feminine wilds to get what you
want. Trading on your looks. Read a
book, sister. That passive aggressive
number went out long ago.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And you are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that girl.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s not awfully PC. What about bad
person or bad woman?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s ridiculous.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why do you say that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know. But they George Clooney
was so kind to me and um just such a big
brother vibe and lovely. I&#39;ll forever
ever have memories of him being so good.
I love that. Did you keep the suit or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nobody wants to keep that suit or wear
that suit. It&#39;s not comfortable. This is
2003 mismatch. We&#39;re jumping into the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;ve acted with a ton of great people,
but are there moments for you where you
sit there and go, &#34;That&#39;s Ryan O&#39;Neal.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He reminds me every day.
[Applause]
So ridiculous. Ryan comes into work and
he goes, &#34;Ryan O&#39;Neal, love story.&#34; And
then I go, &#34;Alisa Silverstone,
Broadway.&#34;
And then we just start laughing and it&#39;s
so fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t remember Ryan saying that every
day and me saying that back. That&#39;s so
ridiculous. I loved Mismatch. That was a
hard job. It was a lot of work, but I
loved it. I loved the character. I loved
playing with Ryan and James Rode. He&#39;s
still my really good buddy. I mean,
Bradley Cooper was my lover. Not my
lover, my my whatever. My boyfriend for
for a minute there. He was metrosexual.
We had all kinds of wonderful actors
come through.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can tell me to leave you alone. You
can uh slam the door on my face, but I
cannot wait. 6 months.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is beauty shop 2004.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that me?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh my god.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, Gina.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, but
that was fabulous hair.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, every time I go out, I can&#39;t stop
dancing like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Come on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, it&#39;s like it&#39;s in me now. And I I I
have to dance that way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shake it like a soft. Definitely don&#39;t
go out dancing like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this You&#39;re not dancing like this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know that I ever was. What is
she talking about?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was so much fun. That dance was so
Working with all of them was so fun
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I had Yeah, it was a great
adventure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; She dropped it like a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Greg Heley, you are grounded for life.
He asked me, &#34;What does it mean to be
grounded for life?&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I had to explain to him what that
meant. And I tried to give him the like
fairy tale version of it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You must have a good boy then cuz he&#39;s
never been grounded. It sounds like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, no way. He&#39;s six.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s a great kid.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, he is a sweetheart. Bear is now
14. You said, &#34;Has he been grounded
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t want to tell you about Bear
because he is 14, so you&#39;ll just get me
in trouble with my kid. But he is a very
sweet, sweet boy. He is a good guy.
And I&#39;m we have amazing communication
and he um No, I&#39;ve never said you&#39;re
grounded ever. But um
but he we we trust each other a lot and
it&#39;s just really sweet.
You want to know how I ended up here? I
blame my father.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have Irish blood coming out. Set us
up. Tease it. I really love the mystery
and crimesolving elements and it&#39;s
and um also there&#39;s good rich emotional
drama. She&#39;s really so close to her dad
and at 10 years old he suddenly um
abandons her and she gets some
mysterious communication from him at 30
years later and goes to Ireland and then
finds herself entangled in this mystery
and in her journey to find him cuz
that&#39;s her mission. She&#39;s really sort of
finding herself because she&#39;s been very
bruised by that abrupt exit.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My dad&#39;s missing. I have to find him.
Help me. I was hoping you&#39;d ask.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I suspect you aren&#39;t the only secret he
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where are you going?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As an officer of the law, it&#39;s best you
don&#39;t know. I love the show. I&#39;m really
proud of it. I worked really hard on it
and I I think it it&#39;s And you know what?
my boy who&#39;s 14 years old. I let him
watch it cuz there&#39;s nothing, you know,
inappropriate and he just closed his
eyes was when I kissed someone in it.
But um it uh he loves the show.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He he said he was like, &#34;This is a great
show.&#34; And he just couldn&#39;t cuz he
watched it as you know I was working on
every one of the edits. So when it would
get to the pre-lock, I&#39;d let him watch
it with me at the pre-lock and then he
he would he just wanted to see the next
one and the next one and the next one.
So that&#39;s really good. You want my
advice? Trust no one.
