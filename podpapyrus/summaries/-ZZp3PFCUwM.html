let&#39;s jump into some of your previous
work if you don&#39;t mind Betsy brand
certainly here on this program I we
whenever you had some of my friends on
your show I&#39;ve had some of your friends
no doubt on the show uh in Brian
Cranston and obviously Vince Gilligan
the creator of Breaking Bad yeah and
when did Breaking Bad first come across
your radar screen Betsy
but like when did I start watching it no
right right is it over yeah
it it&#39;s so funny I met Dean Norris
in the waiting room to go in audition
for Vince Gilligan was he auditioning
for Hank you&#39;re yes okay yes and we had
no idea what this show was I was like
about it I said because I&#39;m going in
there and reading it like it&#39;s funny
because I think it&#39;s pretty funny and
and he was like oh yeah no me too me too
and so we but that&#39;s how our characters
were not for all of it but a lot of it
um yeah
is that where you were going into to
audition you&#39;re reading the pilot script
yeah oh it was I I said to my husband I
said hands down the best pilot I&#39;ve ever
read I wonder if they&#39;ll actually make
this I couldn&#39;t believe it the idea was
just so
um who&#39;s gonna put money behind that
Sony and AMC did you know that Brian
Cranston had been cast when you were
going in when I know because I went the
idea to being a comedy as well over them
coming from Malcolm in the Middle
clearly he wasn&#39;t the only one who
thought there was somebody in it right
um I no he wasn&#39;t cast yet and then
um and then he was I went and I I did I
go into two or three I think three times
okay definitely right yeah and then you
get the gig and then I got it but I I I
needed it not like I needed it to tip to
pay my bills I was already so attached
to the project and invested in it
because it was so good and then once you
can&#39;t I mean you know you can&#39;t sit in a
room with Vince Gilligan and not fall in
love with him like and he&#39;s such a he&#39;s
such a creative genius but he&#39;s also
just one of the best people you&#39;ll ever
meet so nice such so sweet and you can&#39;t
believe that that the dark stuff comes
from that human I know I know and he&#39;s
just the nicest guy right and all the
darkness Princeton do I mean right he
played those like oh my God I got chest
pains during the awkward guacamole scene
because I just was telling him over and
over again to go kill himself and
meaning it every single time when did
you realize that this was hitting though
after season three like the first couple
Seasons it was the show was great but it
would it wasn&#39;t we were getting enough
people that were watching it enough
people to watch it that AMC was willing
to keep it on so I was thankful for that
and I would have been happy doing that
too but it was great that we had the
fans that we did right and then all of a
sudden stuff like when it hit Netflix or
something like that when Netflix because
then people caught up on it and exactly
people caught up on it and binged it and
then went along the ride with us but
there&#39;s still people that are starting
to binge it now right exactly right and
yeah you know just when I think I&#39;m like
oh like that&#39;s the Zenith of like
you know no one will recognize me from
Breaking Bad anymore it&#39;s it&#39;s
um yeah that doesn&#39;t well I mean it&#39;ll
always be that way uh what was the
toughest scene for you to do oh my God
sorry spoiler alert I think
um right I mean is there like like I
um when uh
oh it&#39;s heartbreaking
um when Skyler oh god well you know what
there&#39;s some scenes I haven&#39;t even
watched because it&#39;s too hard for me are
you serious where you did it once and
you just can&#39;t watch it well I&#39;m not in
I&#39;m not in I&#39;m not in um oh yeah but
sorry yesterday uh where
um Skyler and Marie fight and I slap her
um that was
one of the saddest days for me for my
character because that I love their
relationship and I was like that&#39;s done
now that will never be the same yeah
once I know that she was involved had
anything to do the gym world had
anything to do with Hank
and the scene where Hank where it he he
realized that Walter White was
Heisenberg and everything that goes on
where he&#39;s basically
you know on the toilet yeah learning
about this sort of I was so scared when
I read that pilot and some of it had
been redacted and I said to Vince I said
what&#39;s happening is he going to die a
very sad Elvis Presley death on the can
is that how is that what you&#39;re going to
do because I want to know about that if
that&#39;s good just so I can prepare myself
and he goes you know what but I I like
that that&#39;s my been skill that&#39;s a good
one so I I guess this is a silly
follow-up question but I&#39;ll ask anyone
you you receive redacted scripts yeah
yeah up up and uh you know in the
beginning because you get those pretty
far ahead before shooting and so you
know it this show was you know so many
people were into it it just
um we didn&#39;t want to chance having it
get out there right having someone find
it you know we did have someone who
wasn&#39;t involved with the show come
across a script and it you know it was
you know it&#39;s
it we don&#39;t want to everyone puts a lot
of work into it we didn&#39;t want that to
happen right and so everything was top
secret uh obviously you know on the set
for something like that so uh because we
yeah I we had Brian Cranston on the show
and he said the toughest scene he had to
do was the one involving Kristen Ritter
you know when she yeah her character
died and Walt basically watched her and
criticized him right I saw him right
after that
um that was a tough scene first what is
it I mean it&#39;s funny we would do a class
picture every year okay everybody would
come and do a class picture and
um and he uh yeah he
um he was crying like he just like
because you hold it together yes well
you&#39;re shooting and then
you know I after he did that scene you
found him just like someone was crying
and he was like just it was he was that
was tough yeah give him a second yeah no
doubt about it catch the Rich Eisen show
