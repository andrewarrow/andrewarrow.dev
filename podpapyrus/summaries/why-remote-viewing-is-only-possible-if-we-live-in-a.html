Have you had any remote viewers on your
show? You had a few. You have? I saw I
saw that. Um well, it turns out uh my
wife is taking a course and one of the
original remote viewers is Paul Paul
Smith and he was in the army and he did
this work I believe for the CIA and he
has a book out. It&#39;s basically the guide
to remote viewing and this has been
really interesting. Okay. So, how does
it work? Well, I I don&#39;t know, but but
it works because if you read his book
and some of the work by um Joe McMongle,
he&#39;s he&#39;s also any of his interviews are
really terrific because he lays it out
there and so my wife&#39;s been taking these
courses and you it&#39;s very deliberate,
methodical how they do that the course
and she&#39;s um
and uh and she&#39;s basically gotten what
they call hits. She&#39;s had the instru
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we&#39;re talking what
they do is they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have a scene
and they&#39;ll give her coordinates and
they have a clear image. They have a
picture from it and and then then they
teach her a protocol on how to basically
channel or if you for lack of a better
word where where that is what what
what&#39;s there and and and they she&#39;s done
this probably seven or eight times and
uh on almost every time she&#39;s gotten it
right and it&#39;s been these complex either
buildings landscapes and she has
described them it&#39;s you can&#39;t make it up
and so it&#39;s been fun to watch Because
everybody has the ability and when they
teach you the protocol about how to it&#39;s
non-local communication and information
transfer which is nothing unusual if you
if you accept the fact that quantum
mechanics and physics is real right
that&#39;s non-local uh communication and
information transfer
that our minds have the same ability and
in fact there&#39;s a guy named Alexander
went who wrote a book about this called
social science and the quantum mind I
believe it&#39;s called and he he He he
looks into this idea that uh we are um
we&#39;re basically
wave functions like if you study quantum
mechanics and the fact that an obser
observer will collapse the wave function
the observer effect.
That&#39;s right. And and that that&#39;s what
we are really.
Yeah. Have you heard Georgiani&#39;s theory
on this?
No. Tell me.
He&#39;s got this theory uh that reconciles
that with the simulation.
Oh, that&#39;s another one. Okay.
Yeah. So um
there&#39;s this guy named Claude Shannon
who was the one who developed the idea
of transmission transmitting data like
like bits binary bits and um that was
after the touring computer in the 40s
after we first developed computers
um and then uh there&#39;s this other guy
named Ralph Landau who came up with a
theory that data on a hard drive has
Yeah. So uh the way he reconciles the
way he he explains that is um using like
the two laws of thermodynamics. One of
them that energy can never be created or
destroyed only transferred and the other
one is entropy always goes up in a
closed system in our universe um
disorder. It it always increases hence
like the heat death of the universe. So
if you if you take those laws that
entropy always goes up and that energy
and energy and mass are interconvertible
and energy is never created or
destroyed. It&#39;s only transferred.
If you have a blank hard drive, it&#39;s
going to be all ones or all zeros before
you encode data, before you store data
on it. Then it becomes high entropy
disorder, a chaos, a chaotic mess of
ones and zeros on that hard drive.
So what happens if you erase 100
terabytes off of this hard drive? It
goes from chaot chaos ones and zeros to
all zeros all ones. The entropy goes
down which according to the laws of
thermodynamics it can&#39;t happen. That
that has to be transferred out of the
hard drive.
if you do have all the data on the hard
it would be theoretically according to
Landau that and you could and you could
weigh it and if we had tools to weigh
those hard drives, he thinks that all
the hard drives across the face of the
earth right now and all the server
farms, all the data on every single hard
drive would be like a a kilogram right
Oh boy.
But like every year the data storage
goes up 25%.
Now, if you add in uh exponential
growth, like reaching the tech
technological singularity, how much
that&#39;s going to grow, it&#39;s going to be,
we don&#39;t know what that&#39;s going to be.
But if you keep it stable at 25% growth
every year, he theorized in like 340
years, we&#39;re going to have the mass of
the moon on the surface of the Earth in
data stored on hard drives, right?
So, and then, so here&#39;s the crazy way.
Here&#39;s where it gets crazy. If you crack
open a hard drive when it has all this
data stored on it, you can&#39;t see
anything. There&#39;s no you can&#39;t see the
mass, you can&#39;t see the data, right? So,
if the stuff on the hard drive is
actually mass
and if you can weigh it and it actually,
you know, is mass and it&#39;s
electromagnetically indetectable, he
says, what other kind of mass do we know
of that is not detectable
electromagnetically?
dark matter
because we looked at the spins of the
galaxies. We looked at like the center
of the galaxy. The spin is the same as
the outer rim of the galaxy when it
should be faster on the inside. So
they&#39;re saying that dark matter has mass
that&#39;s flattening the spin rate of all
these galaxies. So he&#39;s saying if dark
matter is the same thing as mass on a
hard drive
that means mass,
energy and information are all
interconvertible, not just mass and
So that means dark matter is a
computational cloud.
And our consciousness, we&#39;re using
consciousness as a fundamental way to
interact with that. the same way you use
a computer screen to interact with a
hard drive.
So, I was just talking to my wife about
and he thinks that reconciles perfectly
with parasychology and stuff like uh
That&#39;s right. And in fact, I forgot the
researcher Karen told me and I don&#39;t
remember she there&#39;s a paper out there,
there&#39;s probably many about um
weighing someone&#39;s brain after before
they die and after they die
and it weighs less after they die. And
this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t anything about the
the fluids and whatever. It&#39;s energy and
mass are equivalent. And you have energy
as an conscious entity. And that that
trans that somehow that that energy gets
transferred somewhere and you can
measure it in in the mass equivalent.
Yes. And I and I and I we haven&#39;t gotten
into this part yet, but uh I&#39;m 100%
certain that human consciousness
survives physical death. I I don&#39;t have
any doubt in my mind. Yeah.
And I know this for a lot of reasons and
um that have all sort of just a big uh
series of events and things I&#39;ve read
and and I I again um there&#39;s so much in
other religions that embrace this. And
so I I it&#39;s this is again like UAP.
People think this is so fantastic in the
mainstream media and the mainstream
science world
where almost every civilization has
embraced it.
And we&#39;re only now coming back to that.
Yeah. Uh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a and this is
all being studied. Bigalow studied it.
And then there&#39;s the University of
Virginia&#39;s division of perceptual
studies, DOPS. I think that&#39;s the right
name of it. They This is what they do.
They they have scientists that are
dedicated to studying this
this whole phenomena, which is really
fascinating. And again, I I have actual
proof. I and I know this is I know uh we
had a life experience that caused us to
look in come into contact with a number
of mediums and they are all more accur
so accurate that you can&#39;t make it up
you can&#39;t accidentally arrive at the
things they know
in fact I know several of them they&#39;re
very and they&#39;re not charlatans not
doing this to make money this they have
a gift they could connect to that
and there&#39;s a weird interplay again with
NHI and I don&#39;t know how that fits but
It&#39;s and in fact Jacques Valle in the
invisible college talks about this
paranormal element of UAP.
I don&#39;t understand it all yet but I I I
know what I&#39;ve seen and uh
there&#39;s definitely something there and
the the simulation aspect to it. If you
if you look at the observer effect and
you say that you know when the wave
function collapse only when you&#39;re
collapses and you see things only when
you&#39;re when you&#39;re observing them do
they actually happen. I mean that makes
perfect sense in a video game because
it&#39;s conserving processing power. When
you&#39;re in one room in a video game the
outside of it is not being rendered
until you actually go there, right? And
that also works perfectly with Sheldre&#39;s
morphic resonance. Right? If one problem
is solved in one part of the world, like
if one person breaks a world record in
France, some there going to be five more
people breaking that same world record
in the next couple years somewhere else.
