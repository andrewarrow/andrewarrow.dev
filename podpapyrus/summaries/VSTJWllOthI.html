thank you to Halliday AI for sponsoring
this video we&#39;ve all watched science
fiction movies and seen the technology
that you know is like never going to
happen we&#39;re not going suddenly push a
button and warp to another location
sometimes in the movies you see
technology you&#39;re like that seems like
something we could have something that
could actually exist in the real world
we&#39;ve seen the glasses and Minority
Report but we never really got something
like that instead we got these big
goggles that kind of gave us a glimpse
of the future but never gave us
the full
future all right so I&#39;ve got these all
new smart glasses from a company called
holiday and these were a huge like
runaway hit at Cs and actually they were
so big uh they went on to become
actually the most backed AI glasses ever
on Kickstarter if you spend time on
Kickstarter you know there are a lot on
there so it&#39;s a pretty big deal for
Halliday and one of the things that
stood out to me I think the biggest
thing about them is they don&#39;t look like
typical smart glasses they look and feel
like a regular pair of glasses kind of
understated design extremely lightweight
it just looks normal the Halliday and
the reason they were the most funded AI
glasses on Kickstarter history uh for a
few reasons I think the biggest one is
what they&#39;re calling their Digi window
display technology techology you&#39;ve
probably seen a lot of glasses similar
that kind of project images on the glass
itself it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s called a wave
guide system and for a lot of ways that
works but what happens with those if you
get a lot of sunlight coming in you get
bleed uh it can also be really
distracting if you&#39;re trying to look or
talk to somebody and things are coming
constantly across your eye so what
holiday has done with there sort Digi
window technology is they&#39;re using a
micro LED like a really teeny tiny micro
led to create a discreet kind of virtual
screen in the upper kind of right field
of view which serves a few purposes
first it&#39;s completely invisible to
others and you until you glance up so
the digi window display is also going to
like adapt to each person using it it&#39;s
going to let you do sort of horizontal
and vertical adjustments you can
actually physically move it uh to match
individual eye spacing I think with
something like this too Comfort is a
giant deal uh they&#39;ve got adjustable
nose pads to make sure that the viewing
Le is working well for you and also it&#39;s
not going to dig into the side of your
nose the display sits out of your main
line of sight this can totally replace
your just normal glasses giving you all
the perks of AR but also letting you
sort of use them in a normal glasses
sense that looking like you&#39;ve got you a
pair of Technology sitting on your face
holiday claims the AI glasses have up to
12 hours of battery life I&#39;ve only been
able to test these in all fairness for a
very limited time but for me that
Benchmark is usually just getting
through a work day and these can do do
that so the next thing that I want to
like try is like how easy it&#39;s actually
like to use let&#39;s do something that at
least I do many times throughout the day
probably you do too just respond to a
text so notification window pops up and
I can see right away exactly what it is
I have some pre-filled AI response I can
use to respond quickly which I thought
was actually really neat and
surprisingly useful so I can use the
temple controls on the side here or I
can use a companion ring this actually a
really interesting way while it sort of
might not for everyone I already wear a
smart ring so I don&#39;t really give it a
second thought there&#39;s definitely like a
learning curve to remembering the
gestures and what this does it&#39;s pretty
cool once you actually get the hang of
it allows you to have level of control
it can be really more subtle and
discreet instead of using your voice or
tapping on the glasses themselves and
it&#39;s really simple design it&#39;s got a
button on it that I can press I can
double tap and also it&#39;s touch sensitive
so I can swipe up down left or right and
it happens very naturally on the
other hand uh it does kind of feel like
an extra step something else you have to
charge and put on be able just see
notifications as they come in then using
the AI to quickly respond to a few Taps
is really useful and kind of like a step
above what you can do with an Apple
Watch with those times you want to see a
message really quickly respond and move
on the glasses like serve that use case
absolutely perfectly all right so I&#39;ve
got this set up I can respond to a text
like what else can I do the tech in the
glasses is cool and kind of of a new way
to do it uh but like most things it
pairs with an app that can enable even
sort of more functionality this might be
one of the coolest holidays translation
feature you can instantly see
translations of what others are saying
displayed in your Digi window which is
really helpful for understanding
conversations in foreign languages
obviously even if you can&#39;t speak them
you can also do a lot of customization
inside of the app you can change the
ringtone and alerts you can adjust a
brightness even a silence mode they&#39;ve
got gadgets kind of like widgets to you
can pick uh how you want to do it
control the rapid button what it&#39;s going
to do whether you want translation or AI
or just an audio memo uh you can also
inside of the app set quick replies to
messages so you know things like can&#39;t
talk now or call you later so not take
out your phone to do that replying we&#39;re
about to have a video meeting I love to
s be able to S of take some notes and
also reference some notes on video
pitures that I&#39;ve prepared we have these
pitch meetings about every week sort of
get our videos ready for the upcoming 10
days the holiday AI glasses
this instance I think make things a lot
easier so there&#39;s no camera built in
here which I think is really good in
some ways and a limitation in others but
it does have a built-in microphone and I
can pretty discreetly record the meeting
even go back and reference the recording
or check out an AI generated summary
later on that alone I thought was nice
but kind of what else it does I thought
was pretty cool too I&#39;m able to activate
holiday&#39;s sort of proactive AI agent
sort of put it to work for me it&#39;s
always able to sort of listen analyze
conversations so the question comes my
way can help me come up with an answer
relatively quickly so this next one is
called cheat sheet do with it what you
will but let&#39;s say you want to create
like a grocery list in your holiday app
and instantly syncs your digit window
display letting you check off items at
your shop without pulling out your phone
or juggling a paper list it&#39;s a way to
kind of show notes uh or to-do list or
reminders discreetly in that window well
you can&#39;t listen to music on the glasses
there speakers built in definely
not going to sound as good as proper
headphones or even your phone speaker
but just to be clear these are more
geared towards productivity and they are
like playing games or watching movies
looking for a a movie theater on your
face like this is not going to be the
solution but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad
thing I think it&#39;s important to set your
expectations for what the glasses can do
all right so the video is almost done
getting hungry some restaurants that
opened up by a studio I want to get some
directions on where to go knows about me
that&#39;s the direction so GPS myself
everywhere and in concept videos I&#39;ve
always portrayed Smart Glass being able
to sort of put directions right to the
real world augment the reality style and
while this isn&#39;t an AR experience with
the big floating arrow on the corner of
the street does give me handsfree
navigation directions right to display I
think the best way I can kind of
describe it is like a smartwatch like
souped up it&#39;s here to complement the
full phone experience in a way that
tries to be I think more stylish and
discreet all right so back to the
original question like our smart glasses
here to replace your phone absolutely
not at least not yet I&#39;m not ditching my
phone anytime soon but smart glasses are
actually worth it in 2025 and what the
holiday glasses offer I think is the
best part of a mini display with the
smarts of an AI assistant this is not
going to be or is it trying to be at all
your smartphone replacement it&#39;s not a
on to one equivalent but is a really
awesome companion especially if you want
to be more hands off with your phone you
know generally throughout the day and if
you want to learn more about the holiday
AI glasses check them out at the link
below if you&#39;re interested in the world
of wearables and the future of smart
glasses this is the most unique approach
that I&#39;ve seen to this world I think
holiday absolutely nailed it
