              <li>Gavin Newsom has started acting like Trump on Twitter, posting memes, trolling opponents, and leaning into internet culture.</li>
              <li>A lot of his content has been aimed at JD Vance, even poking fun at Vance's wife.</li>
              <li>He's also taken shots at right-wing influencers like Scott Pressler, Liz of TikTok, and Nancy Mace.</li>
              <li>When Tomi Lahren complained about him mocking a gay conservative, Newsom's press office just shot back, "You sound woke."</li>
              <li>Newsom even retweeted a meme from a Nazi account comparing his high school photo to JD Vance's, joking about a scarf he wore.</li>
              <li>Another meme showed JD Vance awkwardly running at Disneyland, which Newsom captioned with "Go get 'em JD."</li>
              <li>He's been posting in all caps, sharing AI images of himself on Mount Rushmore, and generally trolling in the Trump style.</li>
              <li>Conservatives on Fox News are outraged, accusing him of being unserious and telling him to "put the phone away."</li>
              <li>One controversy came when Newsom said Greg Abbott "rolled over" for Trump, which critics claimed mocked Abbott's wheelchair use.</li>
              <li>Newsom's press office brushed that off too, saying, "Sorry Greg's feelings were hurt. Poor guy. We hope he recovers."</li>
              <li>This has flipped the script a bit, making conservatives look like snowflakes for complaining about mean tweets.</li>
              <li>Polling shows Newsom is already near the top of the pack for 2028, second only to Kamala Harris.</li>
              <li>Betting markets also have him climbing, with odds in the low 20s percent range.</li>
              <li>His strategy clearly echoes Trump's rise, where "he fights" mattered more than policy details.</li>
              <li>For Democrats tired of cautious politicians, Newsom's aggressive style feels refreshing.</li>
              <li>He's got a huge advantage with money, since California's tech and Hollywood donors are already in his corner.</li>
              <li>Critics warn that his hype may not last, pointing to Kamala Harris's early TikTok popularity that fizzled out.</li>
              <li>His podcast numbers are weak, suggesting his organic fan base may not be as big as it looks online.</li>
              <li>He hasn't faced tough questions on issues like immigration or Israel/Gaza, which could expose vulnerabilities later.</li>
              <li>At bottom, Newsom comes off as deeply ambitious, polarizing, and willing to do whatever it takes — which makes him both a formidable candidate and an easy target.</li>
