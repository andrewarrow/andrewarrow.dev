All right. So, I was on TikTok last
night and I saw some influencers. I
won&#39;t mention names. They&#39;re like
minimalist everyday carry setup. Uh that
I went and tallied this up. Uh had over
$8,000 worth of gear. And I was like,
there&#39;s no way that somebody&#39;s actually
carrying $8,000 worth of gear uh with
them. But I do want to show you
legitimately like what is in my bag. So,
this is my bag. Uh I&#39;ve been carrying it
for about 2 years. It&#39;s the LT backpack.
I like supporting other creators. This
thing has been absolutely awesome. Uh,
it&#39;s got pouches for everything. I like
the water bottle holders inside. It&#39;s
been absolutely durable. It&#39;s got a spot
on the back where you can um put a
luggage handle through it. My one knock
on it though, it&#39;s got a chest strap,
which I like, but then part that clips
into the buckle broke off or fell off,
but I haven&#39;t to get a replacement. It&#39;s
a little bit big to fit under the seat
of an airplane. But it&#39;s been really
awesome. And I&#39;m going to get some heat
for this one.
Yeah, AirPods Max. And I I know the Sony
QM6s are bad. Like I know I know that
they are better. I&#39;ve tried them. I can
verify it. Noise cancelling is better.
Bass is better. Audio overall is
probably better, right?
But the case
I mean then this looks ridiculous. Um
I still carry AirPods Max. I think I
just like the AirPods part of it where
it&#39;ll just pair to everything that I&#39;m
using. I know I shouldn&#39;t. These are
still like my audio stuff when I travel.
So, don&#39;t judge me. Speaking of not
judging me, um, we originally bought
this next one just for a joke to make.
Uh, I did like a Tik Tok and a YouTube
short on it. My kids loved it so much
and I loved it so much that I kept it.
Didn&#39;t take up a lot of space in my bag.
Ladies and gentlemen,
banana phone.
Thank you. Thank you. So, first of all,
some of the money does it&#39;s 40 bucks.
Some of the money does go to helping
gorillas. So, listen does.
If you want to start conversations with
strangers, this is the way to go. Uh, it
charges via micro USB, though, which is
a giant bummer. I go dig through cables
to find one. It&#39;s a Bluetooth speaker,
which is awesome. I can also you listen
for music or I can use it as like a
speaker with a mic to talk to people. I
love Banana Phone. My kids love Banana
Phone. Um,
you probably shouldn&#39;t buy one, but all
the links to will be down below in case
in case you in case you want your own
banana phone. It&#39;s like some of the
stuff for everyday carry is like kind of
jokey, not serious, but some of the
stuff I think is pretty serious when it
comes to health. So, uh, I&#39;ve been
wearing smart rings for years. I spent
the past two weeks testing uh, this guy.
It&#39;s a Ringcon Gen 2, which I should
also say sponsored this video and this
section. It&#39;s got some stuff in it that
surprised me. All right, so here&#39;s the
thing. At least for the past almost like
a year, I&#39;ve been waking up feeling
terrible and I have sleep issues. I&#39;ve
talked about it for years and I kind of
started wondering if I had sleep apnea.
This is the first smart ring that I&#39;ve
ever used that can monitor for sleep
apnea, which I thought was kind of a big
deal since most people I think have no
idea they have it if they&#39;re dealing
with it. I did not have sleep apnnea,
just spoiler alert, my sleep patterns
were fine. But having that data did give
me like peace of mind instead of just
kind of wondering and worrying about it
and getting anxiety and making my sleep
even worse. Oh, actually, uh, Courtney,
who&#39;s right there, has been wearing
You&#39;ve had a RingCon Gen One?
Yeah, I&#39;ve been wearing it for like the
past couple years.
And this is Gen 2?
Yeah, this is gen two.
Um, do you have Have you tried the sleep
apnnea stuff on it?
Yeah. Yeah, it did detect a few
occurrences.
You have some bad Okay, so I mean
there&#39;s there&#39;s like perfect um use case
for it. Uh, battery life is pretty
ridiculous, too. 10 to 12 days on a
single charge. And you factor in uh this
charging case that comes with it, you&#39;re
looking at like 150 days total. And I
love that the case itself has its own
battery. So when I travel, I don&#39;t have
to bring a cable to plug into uh a dock.
Also, and probably the biggest selling
point, there&#39;s no subscription, which is
huge. Already paying for like six
different services, and most smart rings
want another monthly fee on top of a
hardware cost. This is really just a buy
it once and you&#39;re done. Sometimes the
best everyday carry isn&#39;t about having
the flashiest tech. It&#39;s about getting
useful data without sort of changing how
you live. And this thing just sits on
your finger, tracks everything, and
occasionally will tell you something
that you didn&#39;t know about yourself. The
whole like sleep apnea thing that like
Courtney was struggling with. Um, and
you can take action if you want to. I
thought it was cool. Um, if you&#39;re think
it&#39;s cool, too, want to check it out,
Ringcon did hook me up with a discount
code. I&#39;ll link down below that&#39;ll save
5% if you want to pick one up. If you&#39;re
curious about health tracking but don&#39;t
want another device to manage, uh, this
might be worth checking out. My wallets
used to get gigantic, like huge big fat
Cassanza wallet. So, I went minimal and
the best one I ever tried was by Kings
Loop. This thing has been great. It
worked. Cards for lots of slots. Got a
money clip for cash. Like to carry some
money with me. But with the Air Tag in,
it got started to get like bigger and
bigger and bigger. So, I feel victim to
must have been an Instagram ad, maybe.
Uh, this is the Lorger Wallet Pro. First
of all, I think I think it looks really
cool. Um, it&#39;s got Find My all built
right into it and it&#39;s got audio alerts
so you can, you know, it&#39;ll tell you
where it is and beep it if you need to.
It&#39;s got a spot for money. The cards fan
out and also limits what I can carry.
The downside of this is the battery for
the Fine Riy is not usually replaceable.
So, you got to I guess send it back to
them when it breaks. That sounds like
something that future John will have to
deal with.
Hey, um so pop in from the future here.
Uh remember when I recommended that
Lorder wallet? Uh scratch that. Don&#39;t
buy it. It is a two pack of um I don&#39;t
know how that happened. You see it? It
shattered. All the glass is totally
shattered on the front. Like shards of
glass are falling off in my pocket. That
sucks. I guess that smooth feeling I
liked on the front was actually glass
and not plastic. So, looks cool. Um, I&#39;m
going to go back to that old Kingsley
wallet. Don&#39;t buy this one. Honorable
mention to this guy, too. I carry this
with me when I travel. It&#39;s the Ankor
Mags Safe wallet with Find My built into
only carries a few cards, but when I
want to clip something back on my phone,
that&#39;s been It also bounces like a pog.
Um, that&#39;s been pretty awesome. So, I
used to travel like a lot more than I do
now. Um, and I used to carry Well, I&#39;ll
show you. Actually, I brought it. I used
to carry this thing for all my
accessories. It&#39;s by Bags Smart I bought
on Amazon. And like it&#39;s carries
everything, but it&#39;s big. And I travel
with a lot of stuff. I got power bricks
in here. I got like these guys that fan
out so I could charge everything. So now
when I travel, I don&#39;t carry that at
all. I just carry these two. So, uh,
this one has an Apple Watch charger
built in. I absolutely love it. It
magnetizes. It&#39;ll raise up too so you
can see it at night. USBC cable so I can
charge my phone. Also has an open USBC
port here. I sometimes use that to
charge like a noise maker when I&#39;m
traveling. It&#39;s been awesome. When my
phone&#39;s been dead, my Apple Watch has
been dead. There&#39;s plenty of juice to
charge both overnight. But the question
is, how are you going to charge this?
That&#39;s where this came into play. Uh Tik
Tok had a buy one get one free. So I
bought four of them. Actually use it in
our studio for audio kit. This has been
if you only buy one thing, you don&#39;t
have an Apple Watch, I I would just get
this. It&#39;s got the AC plug built in, so
you don&#39;t have to carry any sort of wall
adapters. It&#39;s got a USBC port, so you
can plug it in whenever you want. But
also, it&#39;s got a USB type-C cable, so I
can plug this into the wall. I can plug
it into this, and I can charge. And I
get that this is probably less efficient
than just carrying the bag. Uh, but I do
love having it with me and having things
I know can charge absolutely everything.
Hold on. I got one more. I know this
seems like Anchor sponsor. It&#39;s not. I
legitimately bought this stuff. Um, this
guy. So, how thin that is, just guess.
Can you guess? What do you think the
mill are on this thing? Say guess
That seems fair for how thin it is.
5,000 mAh uh in a battery this small. Uh
it&#39;s G2, which is nice. And it&#39;ll charge
you, it&#39;ll charge at 15 watts. It&#39;s not
crazy fast, and it does get a little
warm. It does a lot of wireless power
banks. I hadn&#39;t seen one this with that
much power, but what I like about it was
I can actually use it on my phone while
it&#39;s in my pocket. So, I&#39;ve got the Pro
Max 16 Pro Max. It&#39;s a big phone. I got
a case on it. It makes it even thicker.
I can&#39;t usually use Mag Safe battery
packs. Um, getting in my pocket cuz it&#39;s
huge. This one though doesn&#39;t seem any
more ridiculous in my pocket than just
the phone on its own. Like, I don&#39;t
think people would know I had a 5,000
mAh case there. It looks pretty good. I
should also probably talk about this,
too, honest. Uh, I got this from Amazon,
an anchor case.
It&#39;s been really good. I like cases that
have the stand built in, so I can I can
do anything I want with it. It doesn&#39;t
impact the mag safess of it. What it
does do, it makes this part especially
warm, though. It&#39;s kind of a little
floppy, though. I use it all the time,
and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not as taut. There&#39;s
probably better options out there than
this one as I&#39;m saying it out loud, but
I&#39;m still using it. Uh, and I like it.
And again, it seems to be another Anchor
stuff. They should spot give me a
sponsorship, man. This is legitimately
all things that I bought.
Like they&#39;ve never sponsored.
That&#39;s true. Ankor does sponsor a lot.
Love you. Love you, Anchor.
That&#39;s true. They do. So, this has been
my go-to. Legion goss with Steam OS. I
love it. I love I love my Steam Deck a
lot, too. But bigger screen, higher
refresh rate. This did it for me despite
being LCD. It&#39;s been awesome. It&#39;s been
the way I can get almost all of my
gaming on. I was stuck at an airport in
a layover in Denver and a flight was
delayed for like two and a half hours. I
was going to play Spider-Man 2. That
made me happy. This makes me happy. If
you&#39;re in the market for something for
gaming, I think this is the way to go.
Straight up Steam OS. So, when the Steam
Deck gets an OS update, this gets an OS
update. Is chef&#39;s kiss level perfect uh
for gaming? So, I I want to talk like a
little bit about cameras. is I know that
everybody is obsessing over this guy
right now online. Uh the Fuji X100V
that&#39;s the six.
I should say this is Courtney&#39;s camera
who just gave that. Now we know what
that sounds like.
Now the internet knows what that sounds
like. Um
it might not make it bad.
Courtney&#39;s going to help edit this
video, so he might cut that part out.
it&#39;s also the six X1006,
but it does an awesome job uh at
photographs.
Um, but it&#39;s big and it&#39;s bulky. I like
this guy.
I don&#39;t know about bulky. This guy
Well, I&#39;m not 6&#39;8. So, this guy, uh, the
Rico GR3 HDF, I think this basically the
same thing as the Fuji, but it can fit
in your pocket. So, like we go to
Disneyland a lot here, live in Southern
California. I want to get candid shots
of my kids seeing everything for the
first time. And I can get kind of those
more candid, natural moments, uh, which
I like. For video, this one is is
usually in a bag. We filmed a lot with
it. It&#39;s actually, if you&#39;re looking at
the shots in the desk, it&#39;s actually up
there. Uh, the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. Um, it
is like pretty close to perfect. Uh,
shoots in 4K. It&#39;s got crazy good
stabilization and it doesn&#39;t make every
like interaction with stuff feel like a
studio production which sometimes you
don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think you want and
I bet if I&#39;d even tell you about I was
using something different all the
footage you saw of the stuff on my desk
you probably think we shot with like a
regular studio camera. Uh we actually
used it as a car rig. We got like a
shock mount suction cup to the back
where we were shooting that Rivian
video. It was really good for that too.
It&#39;s pretty much good for everything. If
you&#39;re looking to do like a oneperson
mobile setup or you want to film stuff
while you&#39;re out and about, I I think I
think DJI hit a home run uh with that
guy. Just know you&#39;re going to need
external mics. Is there something in
your bag that you always carry? Like
what&#39;s what&#39;s in what&#39;s your like one
everyday thing?
All right, fair enough. What about you,
JD? What&#39;s that&#39;s like your
It&#39;s always a GR3. You had a camera
nerds. I got one, too.
I I I have a great answer. I actually
have it with me. I It&#39;s better
headphones than that.
I thought you were going to get your bag
of Mentos.
I never leave home without my bag of
Anchor headphones. So much better.
Matt, you got too much anchor stuff.
Quez me. Quez me on this.
Clean your ear.
It was at this moment that he knew he
I did beat my ears.
Amy, what&#39;s in your bag? Um, I have a
Why do you have an ah sock?
She&#39;s a free house.
Because it&#39;s for Dobby.
Dobby is free. So, everybody&#39;s what&#39;s in
my bag is going to be different. But if
you see somebody online that&#39;s like,
&#34;Look at my $10,000 thing I carry with
me everywhere.&#34; They are full of it.
Legit real stuff in my bag. Let me know
in the comments something that like you
think I could use or would be awesome to
carry because I&#39;m open. This is like a
moving target of trying to find the
perfect stuff uh for travel. Let me
know. Also, give the video a thumbs up.
We appreciate it. Helps if you watch all
the way through. Shout out to you. Thank
you. Um if you guys like this kind of
video, we&#39;ll do more, but I don&#39;t know
what it&#39;s going to change much about
this. If it does, follow it
