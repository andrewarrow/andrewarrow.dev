Uh, good morning everyone. How&#39;s
everybody doing, Ryan and Emily, in this
very early AM?
I mean, it&#39;s earlier for you, man.
Yeah. Uh, well, I mean, it&#39;s the
earliest for the FBI cuz the FBI is
they&#39;re waking up. They&#39;re getting
started. And it inspired me to hop out
of bed.
Yeah. They had their they had their
waties nice and early and got to John
Bolton&#39;s house by 7:00 a.m. So, we&#39;ll
have details on that uh coming up.
That&#39;s right. You know what? Uh we&#39;re
also going to be talking a little bit
about uh Israel. We&#39;re going to be
looking at a Wesley Bell town hall and a
ruling on alligator Alcatraz as well as
more in the fun second half answering
AMA questions and getting to the stories
that uh would get taken down if we put
on the public YouTube. Um with that
being said, let&#39;s let&#39;s just get right
into it. You know, it&#39;s an early
morning. I thought I was waking up
early, but it&#39;s actually the FBI that
are rising and shining here. So, the uh
FBI raided John Bolton&#39;s home, which
we&#39;ve got video of right here, and uh
has happened early in the morning. What
are we to make of this, Ryan? And
the Post uh got the exclusive on this,
which there New York Post is not in
Bethesda, so somebody from the
administration clearly tipped them off.
What can we learn? What do we what what
can we pull from from the post,
right? Which, by the way, I think it&#39;s
worth noting uh that potential tip off
is a and has been for a long time a
significant uh point that conservatives
have used about the Roger Stone raid and
Roger Stone has already uh been posting,
of course, but it appeared that CNN got
a leak about that raid. Now, the New
York Post says that Bolton has not been
arrested and is not charged with any
crimes as of Friday morning, according
to an official. But the raid comes after
quote, &#34;ears of investigation into the
potentially criminal release of
information, despite Trump&#39;s first
National Security Council assessing it
as classified.&#34; So, remember, John
Bolton was Trump&#39;s NSA, his national
security adviser. Um, now, The Post
reports the related investigation began
in 2020. According to this official, the
same year Trump&#39;s first justice
department launched a criminal inquiry
into Bolton&#39;s alleged disclosure of
national secret secrets in his book, The
Room Where It Happened, which many
people probably remember because it had
a big splashy debut. He was all over um
most corporate media channels. And uh
now John Bolton is under I believe his
his office was raided yesterday as well.
So, the Biden administration, according
to the Post, quashed this particular
investigation um for what the Trump
administration appears to be telling the
Post was political reasons. Um but
that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing happen uh right
now at John Bolton&#39;s house in Bethesda.
Uh it looked like his office in DC and
then you have Cash Patel posting no one
is above the law and uh Dan Bonino uh
talking about that as well or posting
cryptically about that as well. So, uh,
kind of a wild morning in the beltway.
Yeah. And I&#39;m deeply conflicted here
because, you know, I hate to see the FBI
weaponized, you know, for political
Uh, I genuinely don&#39;t want the United
States become the kind of place where
both parties are throwing each other&#39;s
opponents in prison,
Like I&#39;ve, you know, having covered a
lot of countries around the world, the
countries that do that don&#39;t have the
don&#39;t have functional politics. Mhm.
Uh on the other hand, man,
John Bolton getting raided is
oh boy, hard to criticize that. Um so
guess we&#39;ll just uh let them let them
fight for now.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that&#39;ll be I mean,
for people listening are probably
immediately thinking, &#34;Wasn&#39;t Donald
Trump himself claiming that there&#39;s a
weaponized investigation into his own um
his own allegedly improper use of or
storage, which underscore how how
comical that is.
We&#39;ll see.
He had bathrooms full of classified
information. He was showing off he&#39;s on
he&#39;s on tape saying no after he was
president right wait right wait right
right wait right wait right wait right
wait right but he was
he&#39;s on tape saying
I can&#39;t show you this I shouldn&#39;t even
have this this is classified but here
let me show it to you like
yes yes um now John Bolton of course
obviously doesn&#39;t have any of the uh
declassification or wouldn&#39;t have the
declassification powers of a president
now Trump this is what&#39;s sort of
ridiculous about the classified document
investigations whether into Biden or
into Donald Trump is that they could
have they can claim essentially that
they waved a magic wand. And now we
didn&#39;t really see that play out in court
and declassify it. But um you know
obviously it was this these classified
document investigations um of presidents
are insane um and weaponized already.
We&#39;ve already sort of crossed that
Rubicon. Uh and I I would argue the
Roger Stone raid was a cross Rubicon as
well or was part of crossing that
Rubicon as well. was not above the Biden
administration uh to do political uh
theater like this. So here we have uh
John Bolton, America&#39;s sweetheart,
finding himself the target of it. And
you know, at least with the Trump
documents, he kept them in the bathroom
so you could flush them in an emergency,
right? So that&#39;s actually the safest
place to keep them. Uh John Bolton&#39;s
probably keeping them in like a safe,
which is not safe at all. That&#39;s
protected. You can&#39;t destroy them
A lot of people get that wrong. Yep.
Yeah. But but I mean John Bolton&#39;s
probably the last year or two been
skyhigh because he&#39;s dreamt since he was
a little boy to go to war with Iran. So
it it&#39;s been a lot of ups and downs for
him. Uh what do we got? Throwback here.
Let&#39;s let&#39;s do it.
Um I can&#39;t hear it, Emily. Me neither. I
Okay, if you can&#39;t hear it, it&#39;s John
Bolton talking openly about how he um
has done a few coups. He he corrects
Jake Tapper um who says it&#39;s not easy to
do a coup and John Bolton says, &#34;Well,
listen.&#34; Um yeah, coups can be done.
Not impossible. Nothing&#39;s impossible if
you set your heart and mind and soul to
He&#39;s run some failed coups, too, which
he which he talked about. Yeah. Like in
particular in Venezuela.
And now um he&#39;s getting his policy,
you know, played out by Marco Rubio.
And this is the exact quote. Tapper
says, &#34;One doesn&#39;t have to be brilliant
to attempt a coup.&#34; and Bolton responds,
I disagree with that. As somebody who&#39;s
helped plan coup data, not here, but
other places, it takes a lot of work.
Uh, so this gets to Ryan feeling
personally conflicted about John Bolton,
who uh comes out of, you know, the cold
war neoconservative strain of the right
and uh this this question of
extrajudicial conduct. um when you&#39;re on
television talking about how you&#39;ve
planned one or two coups uh you know
maybe it is time for a little
comeuppance uh whether it&#39;s John Bolton
or uh someone else I&#39;m I&#39;m all ears uh
to hear what he what laws he is alleged
to have violated
and it is nice that he&#39;s so familiar
with carrying out coup d&#39;eta that he
would even use the like French plural
pronunci the French plural accurately
it&#39;s a good point
you got to be pretty deep in the weeds
to know that if you&#39;ve done multiple
coups, the plural would be coup d&#39;eta,
Yeah. It&#39;s like when a filmmaker uses
the word say.
Yeah. Ka. Nice. Attorney General.
Speaking of talk to Attorney General in
your world. Perfect. So, speaking of law
and order, you know, we also have some
breaking news here about everyone&#39;s
favorite facility, uh, Alligator
Alcatraz. A federal judge is giving
Florida 60 days to clear out the
immigration detention facility called
Alligator Alcatraz. The ruling forbids
state officials from moving any other
migrants there. Uh now what are the
reasons why this incredible functional
uh necessary facility has been uh shut
down? So, the local tribe that lives
there brought this case saying that the
uh and the abundance um crew I wonder I
wonder if they will rush to the defense
of alligator Alcatraz because they
brought environmental concerns.
So, as you guys know, I was down there
the week before it was opened and was
there as the as the trucks were going in
on a, you know, minute-by-minute basis.
And I am I am not an environmental
expert, but I could just tell you just
from watching it that bringing in
generators,
uh, all of the, you know, sewage, uh,
facilities,
um, all this construction material into
a very small wetland area is going to be
destructive to that wet wetland area.
And so the specific ruling from this
judge is that they have to remove all
the gasoline. They have to remove the
generators and they have to move all the
all the sewage related stuff because
clearly it is leaking sewage and
gasoline constantly in into the wetlands
which would destroy it for you know a
generation or two. And so that is that
would of course well the Washington Post
report says that would effectively shut
uh the camp down. I suppose uh if they
wanted to get you know extraordinarily
medieval they could say okay we&#39;re going
to leave the people here and we just
won&#39;t have any generators or sewage
and just this is the judge&#39;s fault. So
she&#39;s also saying you can&#39;t bring
anybody new. Now Ronda Santis responded
by saying his comment was uh the
deportations will continue until morale
improves. So defiant in the face of the
this judicial order. Uh so so we&#39;ll see.
I could say on the merits it&#39;s quite
obvious you can&#39;t build um uh a giant
generator powered sewage facility with
thousands of people in the middle of the
wetland without destroying the wetlands
because of the wetlands.
Right. Yeah. the the tri the tribal not
in my not in my backyard folks.
I&#39;m part I&#39;m part of the Yes in My Swamp
uh coalition.
yeah. And so um what this came down to
so friends of the Everglades, one of the
groups that sued um but it the the
question at hand was like the federal
component of alligator Alcatraz. So the
judge said that federal immigration
enforcement was quote the key driver of
alligator Alcat Alcatres being built and
so because of that um it has to be
subject to federal environmental laws
and can&#39;t be subject to state
environmental laws. So that was the uh
sort of technical workaround. Well, not
workaround but that was sort of the the
the technical aspect.
Yes. Right. Right.
So we&#39;ll see. I mean the law is clear on
this. you can&#39;t do this. Uh, we&#39;ll see
if the law matters at all.
It&#39;s also kind of sad that like we&#39;re
not It&#39;s not being like outlawed because
it&#39;s like mean or cruel. It&#39;s out being
outlawed because of like the swamp land
creatures have more humanity than the
people we&#39;re throwing in there. And also
just on the outside of the
environmental, it sounds like very
resource inensive to have like a goolog
in the middle of the nowhere. Like I
know it&#39;s like it&#39;s part of the part of
the fantasy. It&#39;s like we&#39;re going to
throw them out into the middle of
nowhere. It reminds me of how in LA
there&#39;s always been these dreams by Rick
Caruso to build like a homeless
encampment like in the desert just cuz
it sounds cool to like throw everybody
in the desert, but then it sounds like
it&#39;s costing a lot more money. Um, but I
know, you know, we&#39;re seeing more and
more of these alligator Alcatrazes pop
up in other states that are not in swamp
areas and they all have like cute little
names. Like, do you guys know any other
names though?
the corn husker clink or something?
Yeah, we uh at drops site we obtained
from a FEMA source the the cost of this
one. I believe it was $660 million for
the first year.
So you can do the math on the the
relatively small number of people that
will be housed there.
And it&#39;s an just an incredible amount of
money per person to house them in these
utterly deplorable conditions
which also put them at risk. like these
hurricanes that form in the Gulf. Um so
I mean also the ones that form in the
Caribbean, but the ones that form in the
Gulf of whatever you want to call it,
you know, they can hit the keys in in a
matter of days and evacuating that many
people would be effectively impossible
in such a scenario. And um so
yeah, it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a disaster waiting to
happen and ongoing.
Well, big question of what happens to
everybody who&#39;s there now. So the dantis
administration I think um to its
discredit has not allowed journalists
access um since they had cameras the
first time when Trump toured with
Christine Gnome. Um but since then we
haven&#39;t seen inside alligator Alcatraz.
Uh we&#39;ve heard reports through lawyers
and such.
uh what happens to all of the people in
there right now is a big open question
and I just my dissent from both of you
or my quick dissenting take from both of
you would be that we have a truly
massive number of people who are going
to need to be processed. I mean, if the
Trump administration,
well, if the Biden administration net,
according to David Le David Lehart, the
New York Times, about 8 million um
immigrants over the course of his four
years as president, not all of them
illegal by any means. um some of them on
asylum cases. But there are many many
people um who then you know unless you
do a path to citizenship which is
politically almost impossible for the
right to do uh then have to be
processed. And so there is a I mean a
serious question of how to do that um
hum humanely um in a way that&#39;s not
dropping people in the swamp. Um, so
that&#39;s I mean I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a
lot of concern on the right now for how
to do that humanely. I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s a lot of um yeah that that
right but if you&#39;re if they&#39;re you know
if they&#39;re talking about addressing it
seriously this is also not a serious
answer in the sense that if there are 8
million people uh and you can put a
thousand of them at al alligator
you would need I just did the calculator
right here you would need 8,000
of these concentration camps around the
country running at all running at all
times If each one of them is $600
Um, let&#39;s see.
People can check my math here, but that
this looks like what? 4 trillion.
wow. And you&#39;re also going to run out of
uh you&#39;re going to run out of cute
nicknames by like number 10. And then
and then you&#39;re just going to have to
start using numbers.
I think they&#39;ve already run out of cute
nicknames. But that was so the that was
kind of the point that I was making is
that like you can expand alligator
Alcatraz and it doesn&#39;t actually you can
expand it to all the different states.
That&#39;s not actually even putting a dent
in really what you need to do. What they
wanted it to do was make a point which
is why they wanted to use the Alcatraz
name um for the purposes of
self-deportation. And I do want to point
out this other New York Times story. Um
there was this really interesting
release of Pew data that found between
January and June uh so just January and
June of this year the immigrant
population in the United States I think
I can share it uh declined by almost 1
and a half million um which will likely
of course bolster the Trump
administration&#39;s claims that
self-deportations are being fueled by uh
some of these tactics. Uh but yet that
number. What was that again? How what
was that number?
One and a half million from January to
June. So in just left
uh just a decline in the immigrant
population. It&#39;s it&#39;s pew. So they&#39;re
they&#39;re surveying the population. They
can&#39;t tell completely. But yes.
Yeah. Yeah. That that tracks to me like
im immigrant communities
um particular like the social media in
immigrant communities is is non-stop
fear. It&#39;s non-stop images of raids and
windows being smashed and people being
beaten on the ground and and so it it it
would track to me that not only do you
have very few people coming in uh that
people are just going to be leaving
self-deporting as as Romney put it.
Right. Yeah. And it just seems like
everything&#39;s designed for social media,
you know, whether it&#39;s like the the DC
people only, you know, taking uh
National Guard photo shoots in front of
like the Lincoln Memorial. uh or you
know these sort of highlighted kind of
brutal social media videos. But then
when to Emily&#39;s point, when it comes
down to like the raw numbers of like
what you&#39;d have to do, uh that seems to
be still a big question of how they do
any of that in reality or if they&#39;re
just going to rely on these sort of
propaganda videos to kind of feed the
hogs. Well, it&#39;s the videos and they are
also doing CBP home which offers like a
$1,000 travel stipen for people to uh if
we borrow Mitt Romney&#39;s uh verbiage
self-epport and they feel like they&#39;ve
had a good uh they feel like that&#39;s been
working for them. Um and I guess the Pew
study would confirm that. But it&#39;s a
combination of the carrot and the stick
which is the financial incentive will
make it easy as they say to to um help
you book a flight and leave. uh which
also I think if you want to come back
you don&#39;t get penalized. So if you try
to to um go through legal pathways in
the future if you use CBP home you don&#39;t
get penalized um as part of that and
then also ratcheting up uh the imagery
and talking about things like alligator
Alcatraz um as part of it.
It&#39;s their characteristic program.
Meanwhile, real quickly, I was talking
to a contractor here in DC yesterday who
said two of his carpenters uh didn&#39;t
show up for work uh yesterday. And you
know, most contractors work with
subcontractors. And the subcontractors
are the ones that are tasked with um you
know, verifying immigration status. And
that&#39;s where it&#39;s in the subcontractor
level that a lot of this um where where
a lot of people without documents end
up, you know, getting work. Uh, and his
his point was,
yo, you want me to hire a white or black
carpenter who has legal paperwork here?
I&#39;m happy to show me one.
what&#39;s what&#39;s the plan here? This is a
generational problem.
Like, what&#39;s what&#39;s your what&#39;s your
step two in this plan here?
So, you&#39;ve successfully you&#39;ve
successfully scared these people out
from coming to work or leaving or into
leaving the country. Was there a single
penny in Build Back Better for uh trade
schools? Not Build Back Better, Big
Beautiful Bill.
Big Beautiful Bill.
Um you know, there might have been
something. It certainly was not a
priority. Certainly was not something
that they said, you know, we&#39;re going to
train a generation of Americans
to do the kinds of jobs that we&#39;re
telling them that they we want them to
do. It looks like they expanded 529s to
include trade schools.
So So okay, so that&#39;s the most Kla
Harris thing ever.
So you So you can go to So 529s, that&#39;s
where you can get a tax break
for put for putting money away for your
um to go to school. So now they expand
that trade school. Now, if you open uh
it in a disadvantaged neighborhood that
has been, you know, uh majority white,
so let&#39;s do DEI for, you know, white
uh and and it has and it and it insists
on doing um subsidized business with
Israel uh for 3 years, then you can get
this tax break uh towards trade school.
Uh that would be, I guess, the
Republican version of the of the Kla
Harris approach to to education reform.
So, yeah. So tinkering at the edges of
is not not a remotely serious like way
to develop a a generation of you know
carpenters and electricians and and all
the kinds of people that that we are
brutalizing and and trying to drive out
of the country. Um
so I I guess good luck to us. Um
I&#39;m excited. I&#39;m excited to see all the
new buildings that pop up over the next
couple years by
made by fail son college educated people
who can&#39;t get a job at Quiznos. They&#39;re
going to be putting up my house. Uh I
mean I even know people here in LA that
work in construction. My brother works
on houses. And what a lot of places do,
not at my brother&#39;s sites, but I at a
lot of sites I hear is the guys have to
now like either park their cars down the
street or park their cars in the backs
of the houses and they have to like tape
up the windows to to kind of obscure
inside working on these homes.
Yeah. I talked to some workers that they
used to meet on a corner um because they
were all going to the same u place and
now they stay in their homes and they
you know dash out when each get picked
up like home by home.
Uh this is a chart um that shows the
foreignb born share of the workforce
declining and the nativeorn share of the
workforce increasing. Now, this is again
like I want to be clear that all of this
stuff is like loaded with to the point
that you were making, Ryan. Um,
consequences that are not even there&#39;s
basically nothing that you can do. It&#39;s
a generational. It&#39;s not like a wave a
magic wand and you increase the share of
the domestic workforce and everyone&#39;s
suddenly taking apprenticeships and
everything&#39;s fine. That&#39;s not
and it&#39;s only it&#39;s only gen and there
was actually there were there&#39;s tons of
money for apprenticeships in Build Back
Better which I bet they ripped that out.
Um but it&#39;s only generational if you
actually invest in it. If you don&#39;t then
the next generation we&#39;re not going to
have like we&#39;re not going to have the
carpenters electricians then either.
Like people think that this stuff is
just going to happen but
we could also just go into rapid and and
long um long-term decline as a country.
like that is also a thing and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re choosing.
it&#39;s nice to have options on the table.
I will say anecdotally I have heard I&#39;m
not a gig work uh apologist in any way
whatsoever. I have though heard that was
a problem for people um nativeorn people
who were looking for for gig work had
actually a problem doing that in recent
years. And just anecdotally that seems
to have changed here in DC in the twoe
experiment we&#39;ve had with this federal
takeover. So I I don&#39;t that&#39;s just gig
work. that&#39;s not um you know skilled
trades construction
like getting more like they&#39;re getting
more Uber Eats
deliveries and
because that that would that might be
yeah but yes but that&#39;s the kind of
thing that doesn&#39;t need
um years of investment to learn how to
swing a hammer right
for most people it&#39;s not their ideal
work situation it&#39;s not great work it&#39;s
precarious yeah
disadvantaged neighborhoods and Uber
Eats is Kla Harris president uh Well, on
that note, let&#39;s move on to some other
Democrat news here. There was a a
tussle, a dust stop, if you will, at the
uh St. Louis Police and Security uh were
called for Rep. Wesley Bell um at a town
hall. Uh here&#39;s a video from one
constituent who filmed some of the
assaults and by the end is getting
thrown to the ground themselves. Uh
yeah, and and I could add a little bit
of background here too that so this was
a the town hall held by Wesley Bell who
defeated Cory Bush in that contentious
uh primary. Um as Bush and other uh
constituents who were at this said so it
was it was tense. Um you know Bell did
everything he could to stack the
audience um uh you know requiring
tickets and you know it was not it was
not a free-for-all. Um but still like
most of the people there were pretty
hostile to him.
Um and so after
and hostile for what reason, Ryan?
Oh, Israel. Israel. Like yelling yelling
at him about Israel.
uh and he kept and he was defending like
you know calling them you know what are
you supporters of October 7th or
whatever. Um, so after after the event,
after the event,
for people who are not to interrupt
Ryan, but for people who are just
hearing the audio here, I mean, this
there are large men grabbing women by
their hair and throwing them to the
and throat. Um, and so at the end of the
event, Belle tells them, I&#39;m I got to go
talk to the media in the back. I&#39;m going
to do some interviews and then I&#39;ll come
out and speak with people. Um, so Belle
leaves and then immediately all the
security starts attacking these
constituents saying the town hall&#39;s
over. You got to leave. And that and
that&#39;s how this event unfolded that you
just that you just witnessed. And so now
you uh I saw an alderman shared that
Cory Bush also shared that um saying
Wesy Bell has questions to answer here.
Did like did he tell them to stay and
then order the his his security to get
them out? Did he lie to them? basically
and set them up for this for this
physical confrontation. Um, so Bell is
vulnerable and Cy Bush is has clearly
been publicly flirting with a with a
rematch against him.
A lot of a lot of news about Bell and
and about his tenure as a prosecutor in
in St. Lewis broke after he won the
election, including uh sexual harassment
allegations, allegations of um
inappropriate like ro romantic
relationships with staff. Uh
and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.
So, uh and also, you know, we&#39;re now two
years into this genocide, two years
deeper, and so the climate is is
different, uh perhaps for um for Bush.
So I think I think um I think Bell is
vulnerable here.
Yeah. And I mean like just to give
people a little context for people who
don&#39;t remember everything about Wesley
Bell, he Apac went all in on his race to
unseat Cy Bush, the Apac tracker here
claims that he&#39;s gotten over $12 million
from the Israel lobby. Um, I was reading
something um that like almost 2third of
all of Wesley Bell&#39;s donations were like
directly from Apac or like Apac
affiliated people. Uh, so this was just
one of the most egregious like thumb on
the scale races we&#39;ve seen since the
Jamal Bowman one. Is that right, Ryan?
Uh, yes. That the second most they&#39;ve
ever spent um to knock some to knock
somebody out.
uh her race was close, much closer,
4,000 votes I think
than than Bowman. Bowman got, you know,
trounced whereas uh Bush only lost by
yeah that a few thousand votes. So
this this could this could be an
interesting race.
I mean it is just this is one of the
most illustrative Apac examples. It&#39;s
like you&#39;re talking about a district in
the St. Louis area that needs to have
what? How how much? 12 million 12
12 million
million 12 million
um coming to prevent one vote um and one
On one issue that has that that is not a
domestic issue,
right? It&#39;s like does money mean
anything to you guys? Like that you can
just drop 12 million to
there already
enough. Paul Singer&#39;s already a million
deep into the Thomas Massie primary.
Like a primary?
Is Massie gonna win that?
because they&#39;re throwing everything at
him, right? I mean, they&#39;ve got Trump&#39;s
team is out there.
Yeah, I think I think he&#39;ll be fine. Um,
but I don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;s worth a
trip. Maybe I&#39;ll maybe I&#39;ll do that.
Check it out.
Yeah. And it&#39;s it&#39;s also especially uh
egregious to see that amount of money
thrown in and kind of, you know,
Democrats just kind of looking the other
way on it. Y&#39;all, he&#39;s just another
congressman like everyone else. And it&#39;s
like, okay, sure. I mean, in another
little bit of uh Democrat news here, I
did want to u bring up and get y&#39;all&#39;s
reactions to something happening over in
Minnesota. Um where the Minnesota DFL
have revoked their party&#39;s endorsement
of state senator Omar Fata. Is it Fata?
Yeah. Um in the Minneapolis mayor&#39;s
race. Uh now this guy is um is he DSA?
He&#39;s he&#39;s like an he&#39;s, you know, out
and out out of the closet socialist.
Yeah. He&#39;s I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s I think
he&#39;s DSA, but he&#39;s definitely Yeah, he&#39;s
he&#39;s he would not be offended at being
called a socialist.
Mhm. Yeah. And so they I guess endorsed
and then decided to
to pull to pull that back. um which kind
of is is is it&#39;s just a fascinating one
as well because it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s such
a it&#39;s such a you know it&#39;s the mayor of
of Minneapolis and it&#39;s just like okay
the the Democrats just they they don&#39;t
care this is still like an old litmus
test that they&#39;re applying because did
he make any statements on Israel or is
it just his socialist bonafiday?
Well, they so they&#39;re saying I don&#39;t
know how closely you&#39;ve looked into it,
Emily. Um I haven&#39;t had a chance to dive
into the weeds. They&#39;re they&#39;re saying
that they discovered an irregularity in
the way that the Excel spreadsheet was
handled um during the during the caucus
that this one candidate um was deleted
from one of the rounds of voting and
that that made the whole thing unfair. I
think there might be more in in the in
the weeds. There&#39;s some people who were
just straight up accusing him of like
fraudulently messing with the
spreadsheet somehow.
Others are saying, &#34;No, that this was an
error. This is the part this is the
party&#39;s error.&#34;
Uh either way, they they took all of the
controversy around it and said, &#34;All
right, well, we&#39;re we&#39;re just tossing
the whole thing out.&#34; Now, the Minnesota
Democratic establishment has wanted to
nuke these these caucuses ever since it
became clear that the left was
had become able to out organize the
establishment at these caucuses.
Uh they&#39;re very very confusing caucuses.
You have to go to like multiple
different events.
um you go you go to one and then you you
know get your delegates and then the
deleg and then you organize those
delegates and then then you go to
another caucus. It&#39;s like it&#39;s more than
just like an Iowa caucus. It&#39;s like this
monthsl long organizing effort. Um and
the more passionate you are uh then the
more the better you&#39;re going to do in
this. And it turns out the the left wing
of the Minnesota party is more
passionate than the establishment is.
And so they&#39;ve been out organizing them.
So they&#39;ve really wanted to get rid of
these, you know, for for a pretty long
time. And yeah, they like the party kind
of establishment leadership just does
not want FA to be the nominee. That&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s not a coincidence that their
views on the irregularities lined up
with their position here.
But what for for what reason in
particular? What is what is the great
threat of this Minneapolis mayor
candidate? I mean, for one, it&#39;s
probably, you know, race like they this
he would be the first Somali
American to be mayor of the city.
Sure, there&#39;s some like resistance to
that there. Uh, and but then also the,
you know, socialist politics.
They want they want more of a Jacob Frey
like seems kind of radical but is
totally uh amendable to the business
community.
Ryan, can you maybe give more context on
some of the stuff that&#39;s happened with
DFL recently? Because I actually think
there have been like there was there are
serious allegations of channery and
fraud stuff with DFL in recent years,
haven&#39;t there been? Like there&#39;s it&#39;s
been a source of some drama.
has it been a source of more drama than
most state parties? Um, the head of it,
the head of it is now the chair of the
DNC, Ken Martin. Um,
you know, so that that&#39;s that&#39;s
interesting as well.
There was the the feeding our future
thing. The
that was like the Biden FBI was looking
into that. Um, and I think people from
DFL were wrapped up in it, but that
might And then the the FBI was um
investigating their endorsement process.
yeah. Anyway, like you said, that&#39;s kind
of not that unusual for state parties,
Emily, let&#39;s keep following this lead. I
think the FBI should maybe raid some of
the DFL, find out what&#39;s going on. Uh,
you no one&#39;s above the law. Uh
uh you know
I was going to say John Bolton can take
over the DFL.
Nice. Okay. Uh so in that case, you
know, I wanted to get while we&#39;re on
Democrats and uh infighting and uh
socialist candidates. We had to talk
about Graham Platner just for a quick
second here. Uh Graham Platner kind of
came out of nowhere with this campaign
video um that people have been sharing
around. and it kind of went viral. He&#39;s
running against Susan Collins here in
Maine. Let&#39;s take a listen to that and
then let&#39;s get y&#39;all&#39;s reactions.
I have never met people who are more
hard scrabble even in a place that
requires you to work like two or three
different jobs. We have watched this
state become essentially unlivable for
workingclass people. And uh it makes me
deeply angry. My name is Graham Platner
and I&#39;m running for US Senate in Maine
to defeat Susan Collins. A decade of
military service going overseas, farming
oysters to feed my community, diving to
lend a hand to other fishermen, trying
to start a family. But everywhere I&#39;ve
gone, it seems like the fabric of what
holds us together is being ripped apart
by billionaires and corrupt politicians
profiting off of destroying our
environment, driving our families into
poverty, and crushing the middle class.
So, that&#39;s a taste of it. Uh, Graham
Platner running against uh Republican
Susan Collins in Maine. What are we to
make of this?
Well, turns out um this this has never
happened for me before. It turns out I
knew Graham. Um
So, so Graham grew up in Maine. Uh then
joined the military. Um did I think four
tours over 10 years or something. Uh,
and then went to GW, which maybe Emily
knew him. I mean, I see probably a
little before your time. Um, so he went
to college at at George Washington
University. Never didn&#39;t actually
finish. Um, which to me is another
feather in the cap of the
Yeah, that is really the best way to go
to George Washington University.
But while he was there to help pay for
it, he attended Bar to Tune In.
That&#39;s right.
Which which was my home away from home
for many years back in the 2000s.
So, when I saw this, I was like, &#34;Wait a
I know Graham.&#34; And so, I te I texted
the other bartender, um, Ned, uh, and I
was like, &#34;Is this the same Graham?&#34;
He&#39;s like, &#34;Yeah, Graham&#39;s running for
Yes, he is. Um, so wild. So, he&#39;d be the
second bartender maybe to come to
Congress. Um
the the race is this guy Jordan Wood um
who we can talk about more. I&#39;ll have a
story on him uh next week. More of a
conventionalish candidate. Uh Janet
Mills is the governor, Democratic
governor of Maine, and everybody is kind
of waiting for her to decide whether or
not she&#39;s going to run. She would be 79
when she took office, which would make
her the
spring chicken for the Senate, but still
the oldest
uh freshman senator ever in Senate
history. So, if you&#39;re setting age
records in the Senate,
you&#39;re old,
Uh and also the Senate is a place of
seniority. And so like you know it takes
you know they basically don&#39;t talk to
you in the Senate until you&#39;ve won your
second until you&#39;ve won re-election.
So she would be 85
when her colleagues started to engage
with her.
Like what do you come on Democrats like
run the per and you know she&#39;s she&#39;s
fine. Like I think she&#39;s like minus four
or something
approval rating. So it&#39;s not like people
like despise her, but it&#39;s not like they
love her either. Running her would just
be the like, h this is what we do. We
take the governor, we put her up, and we
see what happens. And now this Graham
Platiner is offering them a different
path. And I think he would make it very
easy for them to say yes to if he&#39;s if
he said if he&#39;s talked in a more passive
voice like
you know our environment is being
destroyed. Our the fabric of our
community is being ripped apart. It&#39;s
when he
Yeah. democracy is at risk. It&#39;s when he
by billionaires
Yep. that the party&#39;s like, &#34;Oh,
this is do we really have to do we
really have to be so rude about about
how it&#39;s happening? Let&#39;s just let&#39;s
just talk about the fact that it is
happening and it&#39;s bad.
Do we really have to name them?&#34;
But do yo, go ahead. I was going to say
I think that actually is like the fine
line between Gavin Newsome adopting this
new strategy of like looking like you&#39;re
punching Republicans in the nose and
then actually executing on that which is
you have to be able to talk about the
system itself being fundamentally broken
but not in those sort of vague terms
about the system is not working. You
need to say why the system is not
working. You need to have a platform.
So, like you can you can raise money and
you can boost your name recognition by
trolling Trump on social media, but that
doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to like
suddenly this is what Matt Bennett and I
know we&#39;re going to talk about third
way. He called it quote combative
centrism. He says Democrats need a
combative centrist. If centrism looks
like Dan Osborne, yes, if centrism if
combative centrism or Graham Platner,
but if combative centrism looks like
Gavin Newsome talking a little bit more
like a populist while also still taking
all the PG&amp;amp; money and doing whatever he
wants with it, that is the I I really
feel like actually, Ryan, that&#39;s such an
important point because that&#39;s like the
fine line between looking like a
populist and actually being a populist.
And and I don&#39;t think Dems are prepared
for how far short just looking like a
populace goes. I mean, ask JD Vance.
Yeah. And Griffin, do we have the um the
Morning Joe?
I&#39;m going to pull that up in a second
Well, while you&#39;re while you&#39;re looking
for that, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll just add the point
that the the path for him too could be
the Bernie route and the Osborne route,
which is so Bernie always runs in the
Democratic primary
so that nobody can win the nomination.
Mhm. and then he rejects the nomination
and runs as an independent. Um, so you
could I could imagine Graham doing that
that like if he wins cuz Angus King is
an independent senator from Maine. Like
Maine is a different kind of state. It
has a real independent streak to it.
They were they were the hipsters when it
ca came to this. Now it&#39;s cool now, but
they were they&#39;ve been doing it forever.
Uh, so you can imagine a world in which
he&#39;s like, &#34;Look, I&#39;m not even a
necessarily a Democrat here. I&#39;m running
in the Democratic primary, but doesn&#39;t
mean I love this party.
And if and if he wins the nomination, he
can decline it
and then run as an independent, which
that that I think is that is their way
of beating Susan Collins. Like
they they&#39;ve tried the the Sarah Gideon,
the last candidate, had $75 million
and finished with more than 12 million
in the bank. She had another 50 million
in super PAC money. Susan Collins had
just as much uh and she got beaten by
like six points or something. She was
the speaker of the house like that. They
they ke they they keep running these
like it&#39;s my turn Democrats against
Susan Collins.
And people are like Collins is kind of a
phony and a fraud, but so is this
person. And I&#39;ve and Collins is a hard
worker and charming and person um and
knows everybody in Maine. And so you
have to you can&#39;t just
do a Susan Collins light to beat Susan
You need a contrast and she that was the
the Gideon race was after the Kavanaaugh
vote. Um and this time Collins voted
against the one big beautiful bill. So
right and but people are a little tired
of that dick. He Graham had a good line
about her. He&#39;s like um the only
difference between her and Ted Cruz is
Ted Cruz is honest about you know how
he&#39;s how he&#39;s selling you out. But did
you know did you see that she I think to
me made a mistake. Um she has already
like criticized him by name over his
over his position on Gaza which he you
know is called it a genocide.
and said that you know the US needs to
change its policy towards uh towards
Israel and she
she really got her finger to the wind on
that one.
Yeah. She went after him over that.
Mills Collins Mills Collins did. Collins
did. Yeah. Collins went after Graham
Platner over it. It&#39;s like I don&#39;t know
if this is your move. Like you you
really want to elevate this guy. Be
Well, hasn&#39;t you really want to make
this race about about Gaza? Like
I I I think this was in uh Politico, but
I think Susan Collins already has Dems
Dem donors lining up behind her. Um
Yeah. They would rather uh Yeah, they&#39;d
rather do that. But some Dems are
starting to get a little bit uh they&#39;re
starting to get a a little warm uh for
him. We&#39;ve got a morning Joe clip here.
Know Ryan mentioned
Ryan mentioned that you know the passive
voice that Graham should adopt, but I
think Graham&#39;s greatest skill is
No, I don&#39;t think he should adopt it. I
think it&#39;s I know that&#39;s the party would
like him to adopt. Yeah.
Yeah. But you mentioned that that that&#39;s
what the party would like. But, uh, his
deep bravado, I think, is his greatest
superpower here. And I think it can let
him get away with anything. Um, as we
can see, it&#39;s already it&#39;s already
wooed, um, our our friends over at
Morning Joe. Let&#39;s take a look at media
right here to the Yeah. part of the
now plus or whatever it is.
Saw an ad out of Maine.
I saw an ad out of Maine.
Whoa. That&#39;s what that like that&#39;s one
of the most effective ads
I have seen in a long time. And that&#39;s a
who&#39;s being himself, but also is very
clearly saying, &#34;No, no, no. The flag&#39;s
not your symbol. No, no, no.&#34;
Dude in a in a black t-shirt is is not
just, you know, your your symbol. Like
we There are a lot of hardworking people
out here who think you all are acting
crazy right now. And it&#39;s really it&#39;s
it&#39;s the authenticity and it&#39;s something
you and I talked about too. You can have
all the focus groups you want. You walk
into a room, you either know you
people in that room either know you&#39;re
one of them
or you&#39;re not.
And the candidate you mentioned in
Maine, Graham Platner, uh is and I&#39;ll
just read his bio here on his site.
Combat veteran, friend of the working
mayor, foe of the oligarchy.
Spunk 65.
Let&#39;s go.
Um you know, it&#39;s funny. It&#39;s like out
of all the things, you know, he didn&#39;t
like that he was anti- oligarchy,
anti-billionaire. He liked that he was a
hunk. He was salivating over this guy.
He was like the biceps, the vibe. I
just, you know, the bartender that you
that you respect, that you want to earn
the respect of when you come to the bar.
It&#39;s it&#39;s running the Federman strategy
again in the sense that uh when Federman
was a leftwing candidate, a populist
leftwing candidate that
people would come after him um and try
to tar him with all the same, you know,
things that they would try to hit AOC
with. And it just it just didn&#39;t scan
because people would be like, &#34;Well,
look at him. He looks like Yeah. this
American dude. He&#39;s like a he&#39;s like a
cool bartender.&#34; Like like Yeah. Um it&#39;s
not going to stick. Um and yeah, just uh
the Morning Morning Joe is just they&#39;re
just like, &#34;Yeah, they think he&#39;s hot.
Wait, wait until they realize it&#39;s
another vote for Medicare for all.&#34; Um
wait till they realize it&#39;s another
they that that was their problem with
with Federman at the time. Um and they
then they couldn&#39;t quite figure out how
to because they&#39;re so caught up in their
cultural politics. They they&#39;re just
they just love so much that he&#39;s a
and can can can like grab the flag
that they&#39;re so all in that they can&#39;t
they have nothing to then say about the
substance of his politics. They&#39;re
Well, this I mean this brings us back to
to Dan Dan Osborne who was running
against Deb Fischer. someone that
morning, Joe would absolutely bear hug
anytime I&#39;m sure they saw her um in an
uh lounge, I should say, cuz they
wouldn&#39;t just be meandering around the
airport. But
he was really clever on the culture
stuff. And that&#39;s a a huge question for
Graham. Maine has had a lot of
controversy over trans sports, and that
will Janet Mills in particular has
become a focus of the Trump
administration. that has made a lot of
waves in Maine recently and so that is
sort of the next uh bridge to cross.
Bernie AOC obviously have gone on the
fighting oligarchy tour and downplayed a
lot of that and and actually attacked it
to the extent that they&#39;ve addressed it
attacked it by saying it&#39;s a
distraction. It&#39;s trying to divide
working people and those lines I think
are effective. Um, Dan Osborne when we
interviewed him last year, Ryan had I I
thought of, you know, you could tell it
wasn&#39;t focus grouped or anything, I
think, which is why it was effective, a
really strong answer when we asked him
about abortion. Um, and when we talked
to him about some of the culture war
questions. So, on the one hand, this
sort of like combative centrist, it it
just shows how our category for what
centrism is is totally confounded. Like,
it doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t really like we know
what they want centrism to be. Um, but
for the average voter, it&#39;s something
that feels more like anti-oligarchy
common sense policies. Uh, but it&#39;s not
like this neat left, right, center
that Morning Joe would want it to be.
And I think they&#39;re probably in for a
little bit of a rude awakening when they
find out. And Gavin Newsome, too, by the
way. Uh, when they find out what voters
who like you punching Republicans and
those actually want to see, you do.
Yeah. and and an oyster men like how
lucky could Democrats get um that they
that Graham know that the the only part
that&#39;s unlucky for them is his politics.
You know that he agrees more with me
than he does with them. But from a
biography perspective, you know, they
got a a a combat veteran and a and an
oysterman who&#39;s born and raised in Maine
like and is willing to call himself a
Democrat. Not many of those.
Seriously.
Right. And so, yeah, it&#39;s like, you
know, they Democrats, they need
fighters, but they but, you know, they
really only want fighters who meme. Uh,
as we see, uh, they&#39;re much more
comfortable with Newsome and in his meme
war. Uh, we&#39;ve got a saw here from Harry
Enon showing that. So, the memes are
working, folks. Let&#39;s take a listen.
Yeah, I think I think it absolutely has
been working in terms of generating
attention, which is what he&#39;s trying to
do, right? I mean, take a look here.
Let&#39;s take a look right at the atgov
press office followers on X. That&#39;s of
course where you get those sort of the
account where Newsome post those Trump
style mocking types of tweets. Get this
that that account get this up 450% in
terms of the number of followers since
mid June. And it&#39;s not just on Twitter X
where where Newsome is gaining even on
Tik Tok and Instagram his followers are
up over a million since January alone.
My goodness gracious. And more than
that, Laura, more than that. What about
Google? What about those Google searches
for him? Yet this daily Google searches
for Gavin Newsome up like a rocket. What
are we talking about? Since June 1, up
1300%. Compared to August 1st, look at
that. Up 500%. So the bottom line is in
politics, especially if you&#39;re thinking
of entering in 2028. It&#39;s all about
generating attention. And so far, Gavin
Newsome has done a good job at
generating attention. And you know the
one thing I want to mention before Tina
for you guys to get your reaction is
like you know seeing how quote unquote
almost like unhinged some of the Gavin
Newsome press office memory has become.
It makes other people that we think of
in 2028 look downright like timid. Like
it makes AOC look like humble and timid
and reserved. And it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like
oh like AOC would need to like really
crank up her rhetoric in a way that it&#39;s
like almost we&#39;ve been told people like
Kerr should tone down their rhetoric but
it seems like almost the opposite here
with Newsome. What do you all make of
Oh well I just want to say like it&#39;s
going I I actually ran this by a
Republican strategist and I was like
this is you know I think the Newsome
posts have gone from the Alec Baldwin
impression of Trump to the Shane Gillis
impression of Trump. So, that&#39;s
something. His Cracker Barrel post was
genuinely pretty artful. Uh, but all
that is to say, it&#39;s great right now for
for fundraising. And I I sent it to a
Republican strategist friend who is
like, &#34;No.&#34; Cuz I was kind of like
skeptical. I was like, &#34;This is
basically I sent him this playbook
article that was drooling over Gavin
Newsome a couple of days ago about how
he was like the great hope of the
Democratic party.&#34; And I was like, &#34;This
is so stupid.&#34; And the person I sent it
to, the Republican strategist was like,
&#34;Actually, no. this is what you need to
do if you position yourself for a
primary because it&#39;s name recognition um
it&#39;s Google searches it&#39;s donors and
it&#39;s particularly donors and so if you
can build up goodwill with Democratic
voters who then recognize your name and
then uh the donor class starts throwing
money at you you make connections that
are helpful in a primary and you come in
with a little bit of a war chest and so
yes to that extent it&#39;s I think it is
successful
um like all of that great but what does
it mean that he like he&#39;s doing he
picked a redistricting fight which
I mean is is talking about like this is
raw power um but it&#39;s not something that
is actually fundamentally attacking the
system itself as we were just discussing
and I think Gavin Newsome is in for a
rude awakening
uh if a year and a half from now or
whatever we&#39;re talking primary time and
he&#39;s out in Iowa and New Hampshire
talking about redistricting
um and not the oligarchy that has
metastasized in his own state because of
the rocket fuel that he&#39;s poured on it.
So uh yeah, I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s working in
a political sense, but I don&#39;t know that
it&#39;s working in a sort of deeper sense.
Yeah, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get
Gavin Newsome talking about the
millionaires and the billionaires. Nope.
Uh but I think Democratic primary voters
will will take whoever they think is
going to win.
Like they&#39;re they&#39;re they exist. Yeah.
And it&#39;s existential to them.
And so if they think that Gavin
Newsome&#39;s a fighter against Republicans,
uh you know, that he can take on he can
make fun of Vance and Dantis and Marco
Rubio and and Trump himself if he
figures out some way to fake run for
another term. then then that&#39;s going to
be enough to get through the primary. So
yeah, I agree with the Republican
strategist. Like his goal he&#39;s not he
his goal right now is not to win the
general election. Uh his goal is to win
be the nominee and then once you&#39;re the
nominee, you get you&#39;ve got a coin toss
chance of being president.
Yeah. Okay. Very interesting. Well, I
wanted to get to this um before we get
to our second payw wall half. Wanted to
make sure we talked a little about this.
Um, there has been a new reporting from
the Israeli Army database suggesting at
least 83%
of the Gaza dead were civilians.
Classified intelligence from May reveals
Israel believed it had killed 8,900
militants in Gaza, indicating a
proportion of civilian slaughter with
few parallels in modern warfare. Um, now
Ryan, like I know you have looked into
these numbers more and I guess my first
question is like a this is just from the
Israeli Army database which they&#39;ve
admitted on air. I mean, I&#39;ve seen them
admit it like multiple times on Pierce
Morgan and on other sites that they&#39;re
not exactly sure like and they&#39;re not
always tracking the amount of deaths and
there&#39;s also been, you know, um from I
think the view of of our show probably
an undercount on the amount of deaths um
because there&#39;s still so many people
buried under rubble and stuff like that.
So, what is what does all of that add
into this already very bleak
calculation? And so Uval Abraham, one of
the authors of this of this Guardian 972
piece, you know, says, you know, has has
said publicly and says the piece that
that it is their assessment that this is
a that even this is a significant
undercount that the number is probably
over over 90% um civilians rather than
83% because
uh effectively what the IDF does is
anybody who&#39;s of fighting age and is a
male and they define fighting age
extraordinary fairly liberally like
16ish to basically you know well into
your 60s if not higher. Um if if you if
they kill you then they&#39;ll put you in
this probably at minimum they&#39;ll put you
in this probably a militant category
which which they included in this thing.
So basically any any man who&#39;s over like
16 who they kill, you know, they&#39;re
they&#39;re putting into this calculation,
even even given that they&#39;re only
getting to this, you know, 17% um
figure. Now, the Israeli PR response to
this was,
okay, these are people we&#39;ve identified
as terrorists. Well, look, that it&#39;s not
totally accurate. you&#39;ve identified them
as potentially being that which
sometimes your identification just goes
on the fact that they&#39;re a male like
Anazal Shrif like he would be factored
into this most of the journalists that
they&#39;ve killed um they would be they
would they would be included in this
militant figure even though that&#39;s a
even though that&#39;s false. Um they&#39;re
saying, you know, if people pop out of a
tunnel and we shoot them, like we don&#39;t
know their name, um but you know, we
know that they&#39;re a combatant. So that
that should count as a combatant.
problem there is that while they don&#39;t
know their name, Ministry of Health
eventually gets their name when that
person goes to the morg or the hospital
and then they get included on the uh the
paperwork that they put out every day
and then the IDF sees that name and
says, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s a 20-year-old male.
We&#39;re we&#39;re counting them.&#34; Whether we
know anything about them or not, we&#39;re
counting them.
Uh basically from all of the research
that we&#39;ve done, what we can what we can
tell is that they are they are counting
every single remotely fighting age male
as a combatant and then doing their
calculations from there and still
winding up at genocidal levels of of
slaughter.
which is like, you know, we&#39;ve been told
for the last two years it&#39;s the greatest
military ratio ever done by a modern
Although they barely say that anymore if
you&#39;ve noticed.
Yeah. And they the most moral army in
the world. They they&#39;ve basically
dropped that line.
Like you you almost never hear that
But Griffin, for you and I, this is you
know it to me it&#39;s personal because it&#39;s
like nobody&#39;s standing up for us
civilian men. Like, you know, if if we
were in Gaza and we go to a try to fill
up buckets of water and bring them back
to the family and we&#39;re killed along the
way, we would get listed as combatants
just because
Just because we&#39;re men.
Um and anybody knows me knows that that
would be false.
No fighting going on here.
Unless you&#39;re at a bar.
Unless I&#39;m at a bar. Yes.
Unless someone unless someone
steals your cell phone. Um,
that&#39;s different.
it&#39;s a real story. You can Google it.
This is one of the things that
is going to We all know this, but one of
the things that&#39;s going to be that&#39;s
going to probably age the most poorly is
the number conversation. Um,
like that. And it&#39;s becoming clearer and
clearer. And actually, you know, coming
from the right, I I fully understand
people&#39;s skepticism. I get it.
fine. But um at this point there&#39;s just
so much evidence. Um well,
it&#39;s also like frustrating because it&#39;s
like, you know, the the last two years
have been spent talking about the
protesters not understanding,
overblowing it. And I&#39;m sorry, like I&#39;m
not an a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] war expert. I don&#39;t
know any of this stuff. But when you see
like the amount of destruction and they
tell you it&#39;s only this many people,
it&#39;s like I&#39;m sorry. Like that&#39;s that&#39;s
absolutely ridiculous. And so yes, turns
out the protesters were right. Uh
they&#39;re killing basically everyone they
can see. And uh I doubt that many people
are going to have to ever own up to that
fact because they&#39;re just I mean in the
miloo of news, everyone&#39;s just going to
kind of pretend like they weren&#39;t
denying that for two years. Um
and meanwhile, I&#39;ll put I&#39;ll put this
one up. Um,
so this is the BBC, about as uh Israeli
friendly an outlet as you&#39;re going to
get. And the headline here, uh, famine
confirmed in Gaza for first time, um, UN
backed report. So to get an official
designation of a famine, um, takes an
extraordinary amount of evidence. And so
while people have been colloquially
using the phrase famine you know for at
least several weeks maybe dating back to
like April or April May um you know the
it was March when uh Israel cut off
March 2nd when Israel cut off all food
um and then kept it cut off for 2 months
and then led in a trickle after that. So
people have been throwing around the
term famine colloquially since then. Um
but now um
they&#39;ve designated as I&#39;ll just read
this the integrated food security phase
classification IPC which is used by
governments and international bodies to
identify hunger levels around the world
has raised its classifi classification
to phase 5 the highest and most severe.
It says over half a million people
across the Gaza Strip are facing
catastrophic conditions characterized by
starvation, destitution, uh, and death.
Uh, and it and it it goes on elsewhere
to say that um even a matter of days
that that go by without immediate
surging of uh nutritional support and
medical support um will lead, you know,
to irreversible damage for, you know, as
they&#39;re saying 500,000 people at like
immediate risk. Um, and so this is uh
this is the step that people were hoping
would not be reached because because
it&#39;s such a high bar to clear kind of
logistically and bureaucratically for
the IPC to actually come out and say
that we&#39;re at phase 5 that it&#39;s um
reflective of, you know, uh just an
utterly extraordinary situation.
Yeah. And you said, you know, oh,
they&#39;re not using the they&#39;re not really
debating the numbers as much anymore in
the Israeli uh spokespeople aren&#39;t
mentioning that they&#39;re a moral army
anymore. So, uh, certain American media
influencers have sort of said, &#34;Don&#39;t
worry, we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take up the we&#39;ll
take up the mantle. We&#39;ll handle it all
from here.&#34; people like the free press
still going on doing these uh insane
articles like this woman Olivia Ryoldold
who uh is complaining that her articles
saying there&#39;s no starvation in Gaza.
Now she&#39;s losing childhood friends
because of it and she&#39;s the real victim
here. And uh we&#39;re going to go to the
second half now, but we do have some I
want to bring up some conservative
American influencers have been sent to
Gaza to prove that starvation is not
real. A lot of these guys are associated
with um what&#39;s it called? The the
learning one. Prageru.
The learning one.
The learning one. Yeah, they&#39;re sending
their best. Um we&#39;re going to look at
that the second half. Um folks uh for
