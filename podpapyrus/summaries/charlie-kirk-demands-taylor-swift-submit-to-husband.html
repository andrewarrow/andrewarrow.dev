Good morning and welcome to Breaking
Points, Emily. How you doing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good. We&#39;ve got two of the most famous
tailor to cover on the show today.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s right. Taylor Loren and the other
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that Swift.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Taylor Swift.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s right. Uh we were going to lead
the show, of course, with the biggest
news in the country,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which is that Cracker Barrel is going
back to its original logo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And they called the White House. and
called the White House and we&#39;re all
happy about this, right? This is a big
win for the country.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a big win for me personally. I&#39;d
prefer the old Cracker Barrel, but I&#39;m
not sure that it it warranted the
president&#39;s attention,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but then that got pushed aside because
bigger news.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you can&#39;t waste oxygen on Cracker
Barrel when Taylor Swift&#39;s getting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Taylor Swift is getting engaged.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, in in all honesty, we have a
massive show today. If you look at the
bottom bar and you&#39;re watching this, uh,
yes, that is accurate. We have that many
blocks to get through. We did sort of
twist producer Griffin&#39;s arm to let us
talk about the Taylor Swift engagement
because Ryan was checking his DMs last
night and the people were amazing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People want to know what Emily thinks
about Taylor Swift.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and your background is in like culture
and how this is supposed to be important
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and tells us things about
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; things. I&#39;ve spilled a lot of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what&#39;s your what&#39;s your take here?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We got to get to Charlie Kirk. Do you
want to do that first or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, let&#39;s let&#39;s get through the uh
intro to the show.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, okay. People can just guess. It&#39;s
basically the same show that we do every
every day.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s true. Howard Lutnik back on the
circuit talking about China, talking
about university and university grants,
research grants, all of that. And that
comes on the heels of the Fed. He&#39;s
talking about Intel, very uncertain
economic climate to say the least. So,
we&#39;ll get into updates on that. Uh,
we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about
Alex Jones thinking Donald Trump is in a
seriously bad state uh healthwise and
you know what he actually know what Alex
Jones thinks here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s important to know what Alex Jones
thinks but Trump obviously has been
visibly bruised and so we&#39;re going to
break all of the information that we
have on that down. Uh Ryan, we&#39;re
talking about Wesley Bell and Israel&#39;s
influence in American politics. U we
have a new nickname for Hakee Jeff from
Charlemagne who comes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh boy. called him Apac Shakur.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apac Shakur.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s one&#39;s going to leave a mark.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It hurts. It it auto corrected from
producer Griffin to Apac Shakira, which
I thought was pretty good, too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apac Shakur is just brutal. It
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is brutal. Um, and Ryan, you&#39;re also
walking us through some new reporting on
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. In uh in Maine. So, Graham Platner
will be here tomorrow. He&#39;s the now
Bernie endorsed uh working-class oyster
running uh for Senate in in Maine in the
Democratic primary. There&#39;s a an
existing candidate in that race who has
already raised $2 million. I&#39;m going to
help uh you figure out how it is. He
raised uh $2 million this this quickly.
It&#39;s quite an incredible story.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I&#39;m looking forward to that. And
then Taylor Loren will be with us for I
think what&#39;s definitely going to be a
debate about cell phones in high
schools. It&#39;s back to school season. So,
a lot of kids have new cell phone bands
or yonder pouches that they&#39;re walking
into school with this year, but other
people like your kids are used to it at
this point, right? Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, when my daughter found out that I
would be arguing for the ban on phones
in schools. She basically wanted to
disown me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; She disowned you? Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s wrong with you? Yeah. Which is
actually a great
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re gonna get death threats.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a good argument.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was like that that this is going to be
the thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Of all of the things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; She&#39;s like genuinely worried now. It
wasn&#39;t before. Now she&#39;s like, &#34;Wow.&#34;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But once again, that is an argument in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; she&#39;s not helping me out if uh it comes
to it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. You&#39;re on your own.
And Ryan, you have some new reporting on
Serbia that we&#39;re going to be sharing
with the audience as well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, some uh drop site report from on
the ground there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And as a reminder, breakingpoints.com,
that&#39;s where you can go to get a
subscription. We also want to make sure
we give a shout out to intern MJ who&#39;s
been super helpful. Um, and just we&#39;re
we&#39;re very grateful to MJ for all of her
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intern MJ, she&#39;s been helping out Drop
Site as well. So, it&#39;s it helps to like
get the uh drop site reporting that
we&#39;ve been doing and kind of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; help help fuel the the reporting of the
program here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. No, the original reporting is
Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s super helpful. So, thank
you, MJ. Now, without further further
ado, let&#39;s get into uh the celebration,
the nationwide celebration over the
Taylor Swift Travis Kelsey engagement.
And the first question that people had
for you was, will Blake Lively be
invited to the Taylor Swift Trevor
Kelsey Wald?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We all know the answer to that and it&#39;s
absolutely not. Barring some unforeseen
reconciliation, Blake Lively will not be
at that wedding. Now, the Blake Lively
story, if you haven&#39;t been following uh
the Taylor Swift Blake Lively feud, it&#39;s
actually a very interesting story of how
reporters are used to manipulate
narratives and how those can have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can&#39;t trust tabloid reporters now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can&#39;t trust the tabloid.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Who can you trust?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can&#39;t You can&#39;t trust Blake Lively
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can&#39;t trust You can&#39;t trust Blake.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s hard for people to wrap their
heads around. Uh can&#39;t trust Blake
Lively, apparently. But anyway, it&#39;s an
interesting story of of how celebrities
can weaponize the media uh to protect
their bottom lines or pad their bottom
lines. But Taylor Swift, America&#39;s
sweetheart, I usually say that
sarcastically. I think it&#39;s probably
accurate in this case. She&#39;s upset some
men uh by showing up at NFL games, but
Ryan, you&#39;ve been okay with it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Any guys that are upset about that are
fooling themselves.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It I will say when she first started
going to the Chiefs games, they cut away
to her so much that it did become
laughable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s the N that&#39;s on the NFL.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was pretty funny. Yeah, it was not
Taylor&#39;s fault.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I went to a game and they cut away to
me every like 5 seconds, people would
rightly be upset, but not at me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s not my fault. Just too magnetic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re too magnetic. Now, most people
were uh busy. I&#39;m telling you, Instagram
last night. I am in Taylor Swift&#39;s like
target demographic.
Came out when I was a teenager. All of
that like she she was huge when I was a
teenager. Her music started coming out
when I was a teenager. And my Instagram
last night was full of people who
genuinely were reposting this Instagram
like it was one of their friends who had
just gotten engaged. It was like I&#39;m
clicking through and I&#39;m like another t
another Taylor. It was just like the
everyone&#39;s best friend.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People have been rooting for her
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They&#39;ve been rooting for her for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like the It&#39;s like if the Dallas Cowboys
made it to the Super Bowl,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; been rooting for him for decades. No,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean I wouldn&#39;t be rooting for them,
but I was going to say Texans.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re an Eagles fan.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh but that&#39;s but that&#39;s how miserable
her uh experience has been. It&#39;s b she&#39;s
basically been the Dallas Cowboys of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, so Jeez, this is where it gets u
this is where the conversation becomes
political in a way. And I&#39;ve written a
ton about Taylor Swift over the years.
But most people were were wishing Taylor
Swift well. Most people have been
wishing Taylor Swift well. This is not a
particularly controversial couple. I
think everybody likes the pairing of of
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Um, they
seem to be very happy together. They did
their podcast a couple of weeks ago and
seemed to be very happy together. But
Charlie Kirk, enter Charlie Kirk who had
some thoughts yesterday. Even though
lots of people on the right saying
Taylor happy for you, lots of people on
the left saying Taylor happy for you.
The president of the United States said
that he was happy for her. Here&#39;s what
Charlie Kirk had to say. But maybe one
of the reasons why Taylor Swift has been
so just kind of annoyingly liberal
over the last couple of years is that
she&#39;s not yet married and she doesn&#39;t
have children. I say this
non-sarcastically. I say this as a
husband and a father. Having children
changes you. Getting married changes
you. And I hope that America&#39;s biggest
pop star marrying the pharmaceutical
spokesperson
ends up
conservatizing them. Taylor Swift might
dradicalize herself, engage in reality
more, and get outside of the abstract
clouds. Reject feminism. Submit to your
husband, Taylor.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, Ryan, the camera should really be
on Ryan. He&#39;s he&#39;s losing it right now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when he whenever you do the Ephesians 5
verse, submit to your husband and don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with the rest of the verse.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. It says, &#34;Wives submit to your
husbands. Uh submit yourselves to your
husbands as you do to the Lord. For the
husband is the head of the wife, as
Christ is the head of the church, his
body of which he is the savior. Now, as
the church submits to Christ, so also
wives should submit to their husbands in
everything. Husbands, love your wives
just as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her to make her holy,
cleansing her by the washing with water
through the word and present her to
himself as a radiant church without
stain or wrinkle or any other ble
blemish, but holy and blameless in the
same way husbands ought to love their
wives as their own bodies. He who loves
his wife loves himself. I had to have
that one ready to go, Ryan, because if
you don&#39;t complete the verse, it&#39;s not
that the first part is wrong. it is that
the implication is incomplete and the
full verse is basically was very radical
at the time. It was very radical in
Rome. Um is that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
relationship of equals. There is no Jew
or Greek or male or female. There is
only one I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m
getting into this in the Taylor Swift
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why am I doing Yeah, I like that line.
There&#39;s no no male or female. No
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; no no Jew or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Jew or Gentile or Greek or whatever.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey, it&#39;s a good line. So, but uh
Charlie Kirk read submit to your wife
and just put the book down.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He&#39;s like this like this is good stuff.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What&#39;s the message to Travis? U I&#39;m I&#39;m
sure Charlie would endorse the rest of
the verse, but anytime it&#39;s used, it&#39;s a
without the the rest of it, it&#39;s a
little bit of a red flag. Now, that is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it&#39;s good to know which gospels have
been endorsed by Charlie.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You got to keep your track here. Uh now,
but that is the the sort of question
about Taylor Swift. Now, we could do I
think Ryan, I think you and I could
probably go for a couple of hours on the
question of whether being unmarried and
childless into your 30s is a
liberalizing force. There&#39;s some social
science evidence that suggests that&#39;s
the case. And people could understand,
by the way, why that would be the case.
So, it&#39;s not an insane point. And I
think Taylor Swift has been fairly open
about, as you pointed out earlier in the
segment, being miserable. Um, I don&#39;t
think she&#39;s about to be conservatized by
marrying Travis Kelce, though.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I Hey, that&#39;s why we have this news
program. We can follow this developing
story for years to come and and we can
and we&#39;ll report
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on the on those developments. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; was going to say we were talking about
Drop Sight&#39;s original reporting earlier,
but this is a glaring hole in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Drop MJ&#39;s going to get on it.
