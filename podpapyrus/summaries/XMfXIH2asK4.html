I am I&#39;m breaking my rule because lots
of people want to talk about your penis
and I no they don&#39;t
I&#39;m start I&#39;m starting with the penis
but I think I&#39;m starting with it in a
different way.
Well, I feel like you need no
introduction. We&#39;re here with Brian
Johnson. Um, if anyone is, especially my
audience and then anyone on the
internet, you know, I I suspect has
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; has heard of you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You created this problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, no. Well, you we we teamed up, but
you you did the you did by far the live.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Everyone, if you if you have too much
Brian Johnson in your life, Ashley Vance
is to blame. I&#39;m sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m I&#39;m okay with that. Uh, but I that&#39;s
kind of where I thought we&#39;d get into a
little bit on the show today because
I feel like you&#39;ve you&#39;ve I don&#39;t say
this in like a horrible way. I mean,
it&#39;s the interviewer&#39;s thing, but I feel
like you&#39;ve done the same interview a
thousand times because everybody always
comes in and they&#39;re like, &#34;What&#39;s guy?
Oh my god, you want to reverse your age?
What are you a freak?&#34; And then and then
it goes on the sort of similar
trajectory. And then we&#39;ve had this
we&#39;ve had probably the most unique
relationship I think of all the
reporters who&#39;ve written on you. So, I
thought that&#39;s kind of where we&#39;d hang
out today. I think some of it, if I&#39;m
getting anywhere too touchy, let me
know. Um, just because I know your
family and like I&#39;ve been where you grew
up. And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we Ashley, you and I have gone
everywhere. I&#39;d say it&#39;s all on like
don&#39;t don&#39;t hesitate.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Let&#39;s do it all.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. Well, we&#39;ll jump in. Um, I am
I&#39;m breaking my rule because lots of
people want to talk about your penis and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, they don&#39;t.
I&#39;m I&#39;m start I&#39;m starting with the
penas but I think I&#39;m starting with it
in a different way. Um u which is you
know okay so we made a I mean you were
the star of this film Don&#39;t Die that I
made with the director Chris Smith who&#39;s
amazing and and obviously you and Kate
Tolo who&#39;s here your team. Um, but
there&#39;s a moment in this movie, right,
where you talk about um,
right before I wrote this one big story
about you and I was doing some
fact-checking and and one of the
factecking items was this erection moni
monitoring device. And then I remember,
you know, you were you were like, &#34;Are
you going to put that in the story?&#34; I
was like, &#34;Yeah, of course I&#39;m going to
put that in the story.&#34; That&#39;s I&#39;m not
even sure that&#39;s like the most
outrageous thing in the story. and and
you know, you&#39;d always been pretty open,
but I feel like there was this I could
sense there was a little trepidation.
You you&#39;d been doing this blueprint
program. Um
and and this was like the first time
you&#39;d really sort of like just let all
your cards on the table about everything
you did. And so I I could sense there
was like a little um I don&#39;t think it
was like I I don&#39;t know. I I would be in
the same position. It&#39;s like I just told
this reporter all the stuff. God knows
what comes out on the other end. And and
in the movie, we talk about this a
little bit. I I don&#39;t know that we got
in I don&#39;t think the movie gets into the
penis of it all. I think it was more
just that the story was coming out. But
okay, so here&#39;s my question is is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can&#39;t wait. I can&#39;t wait.
So you you had this trepidation about me
mentioning this this erection monitoring
device and then the next day it was like
you you kind of saw how people reacted
to it and then I was I was actually
blown away which was that you you
embraced this and now I I don&#39;t it&#39;s
what like two or three years since then
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and people bring it up all the time but
you also post about all these different
things you do. What what flipped in your
How did you How did you make that flip
so quickly that that um I&#39;m going to go
from being a little nervous about It was
I was like I was just in shock that you
just right away you you want to eat it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. What a
what an interesting perspective to hear
you tell this. It takes me back because
I&#39;ve become so normalized to this now.
But you&#39;re right. When we first started
talking, I I was so nervous for our
interview. I mean, when you came to the
house, right, my my face that now the
photo people use of me to dunk on me
when I&#39;m blown up like a marshmallow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Your your face was swollen from a
procedure. Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. That was my face when you showed
up and so I was we were doing wacky
things and we were trying to like push
the boundaries and I didn&#39;t at that
moment have intuition on what I could
say or couldn&#39;t say. And I had social
circles in tech and in other places in
my life. And I knew I&#39;d get penalized if
I talked about certain things in certain
ways. And there was a question, would it
be so bad that I would be cancelled or
that I would be discredited or that I
didn&#39;t know the cost of talking about a
given thing? So I think when we were
going through this, I was trying to
model out in my mind what happens when.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And is it something that I can&#39;t recover
from or you know, so I just had no
intuitions whatsoever. And then I
started when this went viral because of
your piece, it allowed me to start
really putting sensors out in the world
like how does the world feel? What gets
people excited? What makes them, you
know, curl like? And so the thing on the
the erections is when I tell somebody
sleep is important.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And of all the benefits, they roll their
eyes. And when I say when you don&#39;t
sleep your dick is broken,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; they listen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, tell me more.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, it&#39;s really it&#39;s it&#39;s when the
person connects that something breaks
their dick,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that&#39;s when they listen. And then once
they listen to that, they listen to the
second and third and fourth thing, but
in their minds, they have this belief
that it doesn&#39;t really matter and they
can still push through and it&#39;s like
sleep is a luxury. But yeah, I really
figured out that that was an an entry
point that would allow the conversation
to happen and emerge in a way that you
just can&#39;t any other way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, I think I I&#39;d spent
months, well, kind of like years
following you, but for that particular
story, we we&#39;d talked for a long time
and I wrote like a 5,000word story and
then I think the New York Post the next
day was just like millionaire monitors
erection in like a you know, whatever
they write like a 500word. The New York
Post, they just they just um whatever
you write, they mine off of.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
Brief pod paws for some very big news.
Core Memory and Brex have teamed up.
Brex is going to be the official premier
sponsor for the podcast moving forward
and for our video series on YouTube. We
couldn&#39;t be happier. They provide the
financial backbone for tons of very
innovative, forward-inking companies,
the type of companies that we tend to
write about and profile on our shows.
And we are running core memory on Brex
ourselves. So, this partnership makes
all the sense in the world. Um, go to
brex.com/cormemory
to learn more. And thank you to Brex for
believing in our show and our company
and helping making all this stuff
possible. Before all of this happened, I
was coming down to interview you. You
were running kernel, which is making
this um brain computing interface
devices and and that was kind of where I
was interested at the moment. And um and
I was working on a payments story and
and you had obviously started
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and sold Brainree, which was a payments
company um that PayPal ended up buying.
And so I was like, I got to talk to this
Brian Johnson guy. He&#39;s into all this
kind of stuff that I&#39;m into. I don&#39;t
think you know this, but on my way
there, you know, one of um I I don&#39;t
want to get anyone in trouble, but I
think it was like one of your PR people
at the time was like, look, you know,
he&#39;s just he&#39;s like a little sensitive
about some stuff like Wired had done
this story. they talked about like his
shirt being uh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like having holes in it or something
like that and and um just and so I was
like oh god okay you know and then I
don&#39;t know we had this great
conversation and you were always very
open about everything but so same sort
of thing was do you feel like you&#39;ve
gone on like you&#39;re so open about
everything you do and I know some of
it&#39;s like in the cause of trying to get
people interested in what you&#39;re doing
but I also feel like you um must have
most people in their 40s I do not think
have a big personality shift where they
go from being what was presented to me
as like a very sensitive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; guy to being so open and upfront about
all this stuff. I mean, do you feel like
you do this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because it helps the cause or you&#39;ve
just flipped some switch?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it was an article written by MIT
on Antonio
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Antonio Regalado. Yeah. Okay. So I I
gave a talk at a a conference about
kernel and BCI&#39;s and merging our brains
with AI of how pairing these
technologies might be helpful for our
evolution. And he wrote this article. He
gave you know two or three sentences to
the the ideas and then just bashed me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, you know how how my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; does that sometimes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; how my hair was looked.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh I I had whole I had a I had a shirt
that I had purchased. I was trying to
evolve my my appearance and my dress. I
had a sweater on. So, I was really
trying to experiment. How do you find a
new way of being and he did this
critique and I was so sensitive. I was
like I I my feelings were hurt and I
guess that&#39;s a really good reminder. I
haven&#39;t thought about that for years
now. Um whereas now
I mean I love it like if someone were to
try to take me down on that kind of
front it would just be wonderful. So
yeah, it&#39;s been a pretty radical
transformation if I&#39;m making the the
juxaposition, the contrast between how I
felt in that moment of that being that
sensitive and now but I guess like you
know I guess this kind of makes sense
when I talk to my other friends who are
creators and get a lot of social
commentary
there is an incredible sensitivity to
commentary and uh in fact I&#39;m in this
large group with like a hundred of the
world&#39;s biggest creators and the topic
came up about how people feel about
negative comments and people were
listing out all of their strategies like
here&#39;s what I doing my team only does
this and that and I was like wait am I
the only one here who absolutely loves
the negativity like I just get so much
joy out of it but yeah so interesting
you um you really I appreciate this a
lot actually like this is really good
contrast I&#39; about this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ve thought about this a lot so but you
may I mean from where I was sitting this
must have been a conscious decision but
but for you maybe it was different I
mean maybe you&#39;re just rolling with what
was happening
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Okay. Um, so when we first met, it
was in your office in Venice and and you
were doing Colonel and then
I was there to talk to you about
payments of the brain stuff and you&#39;re
like, &#34;Oh, also I do all this stuff with
my body. going to Colorado to like snort
some some stem cells and I also like uh
you know have these these toads in
Mexico and a a shaman. Would you like
you know I think you just mentioned it
and then moments after the interview
ended I think I was texting anyone I you
you know I&#39;m like oh I would like to see
what it&#39;s like to snort stem cells and
to sample a toad in in Mexico. Um, and
like in those days, I mean, you were
still on this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; health journey because you&#39;d been going
through all this these mental um mental
health issues and and if but that felt
like it was like kind of the beginning
of doing this experimentation. And then
you were also doing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um you&#39;re open about this so I feel like
you talk like ketamine and and these
things. The
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve always been c we&#39;ve only like
barely talked about this so I&#39;ve always
been curious. You were you were pretty
into the toads. I have two questions.
How does a wealthy person acquire a toad
shaman in my what is the process to find
to find that person?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I mean so the the what I was doing
is basically the first uh the stem cell
thing is basically PRP uh intraasally.
So it was this experimental treatment
that was being used for um traumatic
brain injury.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So plletri plasma.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. So you draw the blood out, you
spin it up, you pull out the growth
factors out of the plasma.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so then intraasal injection. So it
was like we did this therapy trying to
This was early on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This wouldn&#39;t have passed my blueprint
standards. This is me before having a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Doing things on my own.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. 100%. Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was wild, too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was wild.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, I sat with Brian. He had all
this blood drawn out of him. I told him
I&#39;m like queasy with blood. And we were
We came into this clinic early in the
morning. You You drew all this blood.
you&#39;re like just unfazed at all. And
then they went in some back room and
they&#39;re like, &#34;Now we&#39;re going to
centrifuge it and turn it into stem
cells.&#34; And there was some sort of like
magic from some Spanish lab that had had
sent them this technique. And while we
waited, you and I went and we got our
our vades lasered with different
different wavelengths of light. And then
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; then the doctor put you down on this
table and like it&#39;s kind of like a
normal table you would find in a medical
office except the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. the the head end tilted down
really far so they could get and then
and then the syringe was this this
incredibly long um you know like a
probosus um you know and then yeah then
you did it you just snorted that right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know kudos to you for saying yes you
just you went along with me and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I I did not give the blood I did do
the lasers and everything okay and so so
that doesn&#39;t that you you stopped doing
that because so it doesn&#39;t pass the test
it&#39;s not clinically proven out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, yeah, I would say there um I
haven&#39;t gone back and looked at the
evidence, but I would say there&#39;s
probably not enough evidence that it
would pass our our checks of like is it
worth doing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is it is it worth any risk? Now, it&#39;s
PRP, so it wasn&#39;t like I was putting
someone else&#39;s stem cells in my body.
So, uh but still, I think that uh we
have a much more rigorous process now.
So that was like my earliest of days of
like what can you do and what what is
worth doing and it&#39;s actually really a
really hard process of developing
intuitions what is worth doing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then the toad I mean this is well
known is is has these these DMT like
what is it called the buff buffalo
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah 5meo DMT from the senorian toad
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sorian toad and you&#39;re supposed to lick
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uh you can you can uh smoke it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you can smoke it so they they take this
secretion and they crystallize it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or they dehydrate the secretion, I
guess, and then you smoke it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I mean,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; people can watch videos on the internet.
This looks intense and and you&#39;ve talked
about it before as as this like
lifealtering experience. So, why did you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; why did you stop doing things like that
because you were pretty into it and you
you you say it&#39;s like one of your most
profound I think you&#39;ve said it&#39;s your
most profound moment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unquestionably, it&#39;s it&#39;s tattooed on my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s the only tattoo I have.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So why did you pull away from from
that? It was just those few times were
okay for No, wait. First you have to
tell me how you how you found your shot.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was
without getting somebody arrested.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, exactly.
Uh I was uh I was posing this question.
How big is consciousness?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So you want to go find out?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So I mean I I know what it feels
like to fall in love and to feel sad and
to feel envy and to feel joy and to feel
accomplishment and to feel shame. So I
have this mapping of various emotional
states that I can experience. I know
what it feels like to be uh sleepd
deprived and well slept. And then I
wanted to say okay now I understand this
place but what else? And when you drink
alcohol you can say that&#39;s some kind of
different state and then marijuana
offers a different state. And so I was
just trying to create a general map
because I was asking the question in the
context of kernel. If you can in fact
pair the brain with AI,
what could AI do with you in terms of
exploring consciousness? And then if you
had an additional layer of molecular
manipulation, if you could take certain
substances in addition to those things,
what really could you explore? Because
we&#39;ve have we have these ambitions as a
species. we say um we want to create ASI
or we want to go to Mars or and I
thought why is not ex why
why is it the case that we don&#39;t equally
want to try to expand or explore our
consciousness with as much excitement as
anything in existence because what else
do we have except for our consciousness
it&#39;s kind of like the gold mine of our
very existence and so I was asking that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and 5meo gave me
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the most expansive map. I never So if
before I did it, if I would have sat in
a room by myself for a hundred years
trying to imagine what that state would
be like, I could never have even
approximately got close. It&#39;s just so
mindbendingly different than my
conscious state in any normal condition.
So it was it was the neat it was the
most expansive, coolest experience of my
entire life. And then and you just feel
like you you&#39;ve felt that, been there,
done that, and don&#39;t need to do it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. I got the map. I I got what I
went there for.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. And we can&#39;t talk about the shaman
that I&#39;m I&#39;m getting the suds. That&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; probably
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. And then Okay. At this stage where
I met you, um
for people who don&#39;t know, you know, you
were you were your family and you were
quite a devout member of the Church of
Latter-day Saints. Mormonism and and
then you&#39;d you&#39;d had this moment where
you&#39;d gotten married quite young. You&#39;d
had a family. You&#39;d built this multi
this billion dollar business. Um and
then you know you have this period where
you get divorced, break from the church,
sell the company, move to Los Angeles
and and you&#39;re going through these
mental health struggles trying to fix
that. how but like
you know where was the line between
dude got married so young never even
really got to date um you know and now
is like in LA with some money out of the
church out of the family you know where
was the line between um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; things like and I I don&#39;t know if all
this falls in but all this
experimentation
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sort of uh dude sewing his wild oats
versus dude on a health quest.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to know which one is
which. I mean, it started in New York
when I found the uh the Brooklyn
parties, the raves.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where dancing begins at midnight or 1
and you dance until 6:00 or 7:00 in the
morning. That&#39;s where it really started.
That&#39;s that was the beginning of the
entire journey.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, for people who don&#39;t know, I mean,
you were quite devout to the church. I
mean, so you had I think we had talked
about before you had maybe had like a
couple sips of beer or something like
that, but you didn&#39;t drink, you didn&#39;t
smoke, you didn&#39;t do drugs,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I&#39;m imagining it this New York part,
that&#39;s the first time something like an
MDMA finds its way into your into your
body. Is that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean that four years after that was it
was a rebirth moment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Where I was willing to shed all beliefs,
all customs, all norms and just say I
want to remake myself. And I really was
eagerly trying to
really trying to shed right everything
that I was and try to become something
entirely new.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I feel like that would be daunting to
not have some people have like a gradual
they always talk about pot as like a
gateway drug. I mean there is this like
stepping stone. I feel like going from
sober life to I&#39;m one day putting like
an ecstasy pill in my mouth. I I feel
like that would be scary. Yeah. I mean,
you&#39;re you&#39;re matrix. You&#39;re doing the
matrix. You take, you know, you&#39;re
you&#39;re picking the pill, right? And a
new a new reality.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Maybe I should have more
inhibition.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe that&#39;s a lesson. You
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think about it like that or you were
just No, you were just going Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean there&#39;s a calculated risk
on all these things and
I mean it&#39;s when see I guess I was 34 35
at that time that&#39;s that&#39;s a it&#39;s
getting to be pretty hard at that age
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to remake yourself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And but I I so badly wanted it. And even
now like I mean in this moment like as I
was coming here to talk to you today I I
feel a similar urge right now that I&#39;ve
just completed a phase and as of right
now I&#39;m like coming here I think I need
to rebuild myself again. It feels like
this is done and I need something new
was here and I don&#39;t know what it is. It
just it feels like it happens inside of
me and I get notified that it&#39;s done and
now I&#39;m just waiting for the next thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for some reason just these past couple
days it&#39;s just like uh phase finished.
Let&#39;s go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I had questions along those lines. Uh
maybe I&#39;ll go to them and then come back
to some of this other stuff I was going
to ask since you since you went there. I
mean I I saw again I feel like you&#39;ve
had to do the same interview hundreds of
times. Wired recently did an interview
with you where there was not a lot of
new ground broken. I was actually kind
of let down by that interview. However,
there was this news item that you&#39;re
looking to to sell blue you want to get
out of the blue you having to deal with
the blueprint business personally. Um,
is that kind of what you&#39;re talking
about which is so so Colonel you stepped
away from and and other people are
running that now and it sounds like if I
read the story right and I&#39;ve seen you
talk about it sounds like you want to do
something similar with Blueprint. So,
Blueprint will live on, but somebody
else will focus on the the supplements
and the the meal plans and things like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think so. I I&#39;m at this fork
where either
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
it&#39;s not worth my time. Even if I can
make a billion dollars in the next three
years, it&#39;s not worth my time to work
for the billion dollars. It&#39;s worth my
time to do something on Don&#39;t Die.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No amount of money is worth it. And
right now it&#39;s when you&#39;re building any
kind of company, it&#39;s a black hole. It
consumes you. You
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can&#39;t but you can&#39;t leave its force.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And right now I&#39;m stuck in a black hole
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and uh the in the mo the motivation. So
I guess part of me people really depend
upon the you know the protocols we put
out the foods we make the the the
testing we make available they really do
depend upon it so I feel a loyalty to
them because I feel like we are in
partnership on this journey and so I
either have to sell the company or I
have to bring people in to run it but
there&#39;s no middle ground where I keep on
running it. vote. We&#39;re actually very
close right now to raising the money and
bringing a management company in. If we
do that, it&#39;s not done yet. If we do,
then the goal would become try to build
uh the world&#39;s most useful health
company. So like practically if someone
says I want to be healthy to to help
them in ways that no other company in
the world can do it but try to do it in
a way where you handle 80% of their
needs versus like one narrow thing like
drink this one thing or do this one test
like a comprehensive approach. So it
would be like an all-in effort to try to
do that but then yeah my goal is to
allow my focus and attention to be on a
different path. But the remake is so
I&#39;ve been for the past couple years I
guess since 2022
I&#39;ve tried to become the world&#39;s best
rejuvenation athlete and part of it is
real part of it performance art and
because when someone says health
if two people are talking about it no
one knows what the difference means
between one person&#39;s health regimen and
another person&#39;s health regimen and I
wanted to just make the the basic point
you can measure health
And so, but I think I&#39;ve done that and
we&#39;ve I right now I&#39;m I train six hours
a day on my rejuvenation protocols and
just it&#39;s a full-time job and that in
addition to doctor&#39;s appointments and
everything else and so I&#39;ve kind of
pushed the boundaries on what&#39;s
available for today&#39;s science and so I
think I might be done with this phase
pull back to an 80% optimization versus
99 and then redirect my energies towards
a new thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. I still have questions
along those lines. I do want to say for
the record and this is This is no BS.
This is not because you&#39;re sitting in
the room. I don&#39;t know. People are just
going to have to either accept that or
not. There&#39;s people on the internet who
have given you endless for uh oh,
this was all this was all to sell stuff,
supplements all along. All I can tell
these people is that, you know, when I
first wrote this story on you, I mean,
you&#39;d been doing Blueprint on your own
for 18 months, maybe. and and and I
think it&#39;s fair to say it had not got
the attention that you wanted it to and
you were doing this thing and then I
wrote this story and it blew up and like
the next day, you know, everybody&#39;s
hunting on Amazon to try to buy whatever
you were doing. Everything sold out and
then everyone thinks you had this
massive media operation. I mean, I I was
with you for months and and years. It
was you and this this lovely woman, Klo.
um you know you guys are doing all the
social stuff this anyway the there&#39;s
especially this guy Andrew or something
I don&#39;t know there&#39;s a few people on the
internet who are really hung up on this
but you know at least from where I where
I stood there was no master plan I mean
after my story went out I had all these
people asking me how do you buy the
stuff how do you I mean it was like you
sort of you either had a choice of like
you sell it or you have to personally
answer you know a million emails and and
it was not like you had all this stuff
in the closet, you know, ready to to
sell everybody. Then you spent like the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; year, year and a half, like having to go
find all this stuff, package it, test
it, everything. So anyway, I&#39;m just
putting that out there for the record.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. People who say that they they
don&#39;t and it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s totally cool.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They don&#39;t understand the economics of
this business. If you understand it, you
know, I&#39;m telling the truth, like it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s a business, right? Like you
don&#39;t start money. You don&#39;t start in a
supplements food business to make money.
It&#39;s just it&#39;s not there. So like I it
genuinely was a I was trying to solve my
own problem and I was trying to be
helpful to other people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So is it was never ever about the money.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There&#39;s another funny thing which is is
watching how all this has evolved that
there&#39;s been times when I thought like
you&#39;re going to run out of steam. People
are going to get tired of this. Um,
obviously there were a couple stories in
Vanity Fair and the New York Times that
they tried to try to end you. Um, yeah,
I kind of thought this thing might blow
up. Um, it&#39;s had like way more legs than
maybe I anticipated going in. And then I
I do I start to like I feel like anyone
who&#39;s running a business, anyone who&#39;s
doing anything they care about, even if
I&#39;m trying to sell a documentary, I
mean, you have to pitch it so many
times. It&#39;s just part of the thing. you
have to say the same thing over and over
and over again for years. So, I don&#39;t
like fully pity you in that is like lots
of people have to do this if they&#39;re
doing something they care about. But to
this point that you&#39;re making about
switching um you know, you&#39;ve been
pretty upfront that this is this is a
religion, it&#39;s a cult, these kinds of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what usually ends up happening in a cult
is like the in order for it to be the
best cult or the best religion, you have
to be almost perfect and you have to be
better than all the other types of
people. It&#39;s very isolating. Um it
doesn&#39;t usually end well for the cult
leader because you end up in this like
strange place. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; where you&#39;re Yeah. you&#39;re kind of like
off on your own um and you have to be a
little more rare and and um Yeah. So I
this is what I was wondering. I mean are
you is this part of what you&#39;re talking
about? Are you tired of um
of having to go around like that or am I
when you talk about taking this shift?
Um am I going at this the wrong way?
Like you&#39;re you&#39;re still full in don&#39;t
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean all in don&#39;t die. And I
guess your comment, man, it&#39;s really
therapeutic to talk to you because I
feel like you make such good
observations that I&#39;ve
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;m so far removed from myself that I
don&#39;t remember these.
If I if I now can look back, yeah, once
I started in 2022,
there&#39;s a natural process for somebody
that achieves notoriety society and
there&#39;s this inevitably you&#39;re going to
get attacked from all kinds of forces in
society and most people do get buried in
those moments and whether they whether
it&#39;s too severe for them to bounce back
or whether they they themselves give up.
But it does feel like that I&#39;ve made it
through the majority of the major first
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 100%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that come and I&#39;ve survived them and now
I&#39;m I&#39;m stable that now when people come
at me, you know, they they&#39;ve given
their best swings already and it feels
like so it does personally feel I feel
very stable in my place in society that
I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m going to get
blindsided by this or that and that I
don&#39;t feel like even when the New York
Times tried to take their big swing at
me, whatever. It just didn&#39;t have an
impact. So, I guess I&#39;m happy that I I
guess I didn&#39;t know that was coming my
way, but now having gone through that.
Um, almost like when I made money for
the first time, you know, I wish
somebody would have pulled up and said,
&#34;Let me share with you five life
principles that you&#39;ll need to know, the
same thing would have been like if you
have any kind of notoriety or fame,
here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen to you.&#34;
And just expected. Do you have I know
I&#39;m making you do it off the top of your
head, but do you have five for somebody
who goes through that experience?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&#39;ll make them up right now. I don&#39;t
have them written down. Just generally
is the number one is hate. Is that hate
um really messes with people&#39;s minds
because it undermines their idea of
respect and status and you know um their
relationship with the world. And I know
in being in these private chat groups
with a bunch of people who are famous
that they really are really bothered by
it. The hate that they receive. Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And so one is you I think that
you it&#39;s not good enough to just even
become neutralized with it. Right? You
really I think you really want to
embrace it and find uh energy from it.
Right? For me it&#39;s a power source. it
it&#39;s an energy source. And so I&#39;d say
first is you have to really reconcile
like what is that hate? What does it
mean to you? How do you leverage it and
turn it to power versus how do you hide
from it? Because if you hide from it,
it&#39;s going to make you a weak person.
You&#39;re always going to be running their
scripts in your mind versus your scripts
of moving forward. And so you become
owned by them. Uh then two I&#39;d say that
you know when I made money at age 34 one
of the lessons that I wish I would have
learned and this would apply to what
I&#39;ve learned now again is when there&#39;s a
power differential with money
everyone around you now wants that money
and it just is like it doesn&#39;t matter
even if their intentions are good the
money changes your relationship with the
world everybody around you friends
family loved ones everybody and so you
You just have to be aware that that&#39;s
changed and that over time even your
best relationships may go sour because
that is now a complication even with
yourself it changes. So that is
amplified dramatically with fame. So now
I have wealth and I have fame and so
it&#39;s a double whammy. And so it&#39;s almost
amplified where I it&#39;s become so
challenging for me to be in social
environments that the smallest of things
get me in trouble. Like the things I
make like the comments I make, you know,
that are trying to be like messing
around, having fun, they blow back on me
in some way. So it really is isolating.
So you in that isolation, you need to
find a tribe that you can be yourself,
be calm, like be open. But I understand
why uh wealth and power and and fame put
you in these clusters. It&#39;s just very
very hard and it&#39;s just um it&#39;s honestly
sucks, right? Cuz I don&#39;t want that to
be the case. But even yeah, being out
and about now in the public like I just
can&#39;t go anywhere uh without being
stopped dozens of times. And of course
on every interaction I want to be kind
and I want to be thoughtful and I want
to like make eye contact and say how are
you? What&#39;s happening? And or whatever.
But it&#39;s just it gets really complicated
really fast. Like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So those would be two is just like
understand that complication. Two have a
powerful relationship with hate. Uh like
under make it but three is uh understand
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that fame is I would rather have fame
than wealth.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Since day one the core memory
podcast has been supported by the fine
people at E1 Ventures. They are a young
and ambitious VC firm in Silicon Valley
investing in young and ambitious
companies and people. Thank you so much
to E1 Ventures for all your support. So,
you&#39;re in a influencer WhatsApp group or
some kind of group?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I mean I&#39;m in So, this is the
thing. I I just um these these private
groups are where everything happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Where uh where like um what do you
mean everything? What What is
everything? I mean everything
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like business deals, relationships,
those kinds of things or where where you
guys are you&#39;re hashing out these more
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; everything.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just texting away.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. The the the best ones are
where where you&#39;re in a group where
everyone&#39;s trusting of each other.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Don&#39;t you guys freak I mean who&#39;s
you must be freaked out who&#39;s
screenshotting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. That&#39;s the thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, some of my friends are really
good curators of humans.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And like there&#39;s just a certain level of
trust over a certain duration of time
and they bring in really great people.
But otherwise, you it&#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like that&#39;s where the world I guess I
remember when I was an intern for the
Utah legislature in in uh when I was 21
years old. I was a intern for the House,
the Senate majority leader, and I would
listen to the radio going into work of
what the public was discussing, what
they were up in arms about, and how they
hated everything going on. And then I
would sit in a meeting with the
governor, the House Majority Leader, and
the Senate Majority Leader, and I&#39;d hear
them do business. And that world
relative to what was being discussed in
the press was were two different worlds.
And I thought, this is crazy. like the
world I thought I was living in is not
the world that really runs the world.
And so it just most things happen behind
the scenes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. I have a question along those
lines. So when I when I before Blueprint
before Don&#39;t Die, I was covering you and
Colonel and then and then we I started
dabbling with some of the health stuff
you were doing and then I would I would
get like grief from Bloomberg like oh
you&#39;re writing about Brian Johnson again
and you know it&#39;s like this guy&#39;s crazy.
And then, you know, it&#39;s so funny now
because like everyone on earth is
clamoring to write stories about you.
Um, and and then you were in a different
place where like you&#39;d been trying to
raise money for Colonel. Nobody in
Silicon Valley would listen to you. You
had made it as an entrepreneur, but you
were somehow kind of other. You weren&#39;t
in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you had done it in Chicago. You were
living in LA. You were not part of the
Silicon Valley in crowd. I I know that
always kind of bothered you on some
level. I think my you could put it in
your own words. My sense was that they
didn&#39;t take you seriously on some level.
Um, and then and then now, you know,
here you are in these groups. I remember
you&#39;d been at Blueprint and Don&#39;t Die
for a while. I just remember you and I
were both at one of these Masters of the
Universe weekend retreats. And um I
remember watching there was a big
dinner. Everybody&#39;s in a tent. there&#39;s
all these tables full of uh
billionaires, scientists, celebrities,
intellectuals, and I just I remember you
walking in and was like everybody wanted
to talk to you and I was like, man,
things have far things have have come.
Um, so I mean that must be like uh I
don&#39;t know. It sounds like it&#39;s
satisfying and not because all the other
baggage that comes with it, but um
do you not like harbor a little
resentment now that like all these
people want you at the thing, they all
want to talk to you and and they didn&#39;t
want to before or how do you process
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I love every second of it. Yeah, I&#39;m
so grateful. Like I I grew up not having
a computer. I grew up uh only knowing
blue car workers. I grew up in a
religion that taught me to understand
the world through storytelling, not
through numbers. So I I grew up
disadvantaged in I I feel like I I&#39;m an
engineer at heart that I I really would
have taken to that path had it been
presented to me early on. And in growing
I started multiple companies before I
started Brainree. But in building Brain
Tree, I wasn&#39;t a software engineer. I
was a non-technical founder. and we
built a really good business. Uh we sold
it. Uh you know, we acquired VMO. Uh we
had a good outcome. I then built kernel.
We were doing something very technical.
But I&#39;ve always had these real
limitations in my own abilities that I
don&#39;t know how to code. I didn&#39;t study
mechanical engineering or physics in
school. And so I had this really serious
deficiency as an entrepreneur. And I
I&#39;ve tried to figure out how I
compensate for that deficiency. And it
just so happened that that blueprint
gave me a path to have enough value in
the world where I could create value for
others in areas that they may not have
the same expertise. So I I really admire
people who build in technology in the in
deep tech, biotech, you know, software
and and um
hardware. and I&#39;ve always wanted to uh
build with them which is one of the
reasons why I started OS fund and
started investing in deep tech
entrepreneurs doing synthetic biology
and genomics computational therapeutics.
So yeah, I guess I uh it&#39;s really
allowed me to bridge into the worlds
that I care about the most and to be
involved in those activities. I just
feel really fortunate. It just it&#39;s
where I want to be. It&#39;s where I want to
hang out. And so I&#39;m grateful that I get
to be invited to those things. It&#39;s
funny because it kind of went from it
went from weirdo to that it&#39;s like a
huge chunk of those people I know are
like on blueprint and and uh you know um
and then yeah when you walked through I
could it wasn&#39;t even it wasn&#39;t like oh I
want to go talk to the weird guy. It was
like it was like, &#34;Oh, Brian&#39;s here.&#34;
Like, I mean, it was it was it was it
was fascinating to see from my vantage
point. Um how how far things had had
changed. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um you people So you when we were
shooting Don&#39;t Die the documentary, I
mean, I got to go to Utah where you grew
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don&#39;t know, you talk about it
sometimes, but I don&#39;t think people
fully realize. I mean,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, your mother is this wonderful
woman. There&#39;s a couple things that
really struck me. I mean, you grew up at
what was the time is was quite almost
rural. Um, this the small town. We went
to like your grandfather&#39;s kind of like
farm and and um and talked to like some
kids that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you grew up with. I mean, it just
sounded like this this very small um
tight-knit community, very I mean, it&#39;s
it&#39;s like lots of people in Silicon
Valley sort of come from somewhere else
and end up in this. But I&#39;ve always
thought your journey is insane because
you&#39;re like man of the future living on
the edge and and where you grew up was
quite opposite of that. I and I I don&#39;t
know if people fully know, you know,
your mother clearly, I mean, loves you
obviously and like like deeply, but you
know, when you broke with the church, I
mean, even now when I saw her a couple
years ago,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know, she was still like, &#34;It is
still hard for me.&#34; And she broke into
tears, you know, to like deal with what
he&#39;s done,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; even though she was clearly so proud of
you and loved you and and she was kind
of like in tears. I It was like this
battle within herself. Um, I don&#39;t think
people fully I didn&#39;t realize cuz I grew
up like in an atheist family, but when I
went to visit where you grew up, I mean,
it&#39;s just the whole
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; town revolves around that. You and your
dad told me I mean,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; not only were you
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mormon, but you you used to want to be
Joseph Smith or you would you would
dress up like I mean, you were you were
pretty into it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, yeah, we
Yeah, it you&#39;re right. Um, I think
actually you articulate my life better
than I do. I No, I&#39;m serious. It&#39;s It&#39;s
really hard to convey this of just how
deep I was in that world and
what a deficit that is when you bridge
to the other worlds and like you just
have to rebuild all of your mental
models. You have no skill sets are
transferable. It&#39;s a very hard place.
Then I got married young and I had a
bunch of kids and when you&#39;re doing that
like you don&#39;t have time to build skill
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like I don&#39;t think you ever went on a
date really. I mean barely, right?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Barely. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So yeah, it&#39;s very um very fresh
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Okay. But then
I&#39;m I am I think trying to ask this
question in a different way because lots
of people will say, &#34;Oh, okay. Well, now
you&#39;re building a religion. um aren&#39;t
you just replacing your Mormonism, etc.
So people have asked you that before,
but I feel like I do have a little bit
more of this insight that that
everything you do,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you go like all in, you know? So
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; even though my question sounds sort of
the same, I think I&#39;m coming at this
from a slightly different place where um
don&#39;t you just think you&#39;re replacing
that whole of the thing that you used to
be so committed to with something new?
You know what I mean? Like you seem to
have a part of you that always needs to
have something to be thrown all into.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. All right. I&#39;ll I&#39;ll have a go at
You tell me what you think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So, one of the cool things that
Mormonism does is
it asks you to contemplate what do you
do with existence?
And I think all religions like they&#39;re
they&#39;re actually posing the same
question. And then if you grew up in an
atheist household, I mean, what was your
answer? What did your parents say? What
do you what was your answer? What do you
do with existence?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When I was growing up, I think I hunted
around for that a bit because I started
reading all these religious texts. I I
never went to church. I had nothing, you
know, like and I grew up in Texas and
everybody was going to church on Sunday
and and I just didn&#39;t know what that was
about. So then, yeah, like any uh not
like any teenager, but I, you know, I
started reading all the philosophers. I
started reading um Buddhism, TA text,
every I was I was hunting for some kind
of spiritual spirituality. I mean, I
would say from my what I was taught from
my parents what to do with existence, it
was really just to live like kind of an
honest um
just an honest um productive life, I
think. And and and I that&#39;s what I was
always taught and I don&#39;t know that I
leapt much farther than that. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So when I went through that
process, so at 34 when I decided to
transition from a previous world to a
new world,
I was asking that question, what do you
do with existence? And I was trying to
populate my mind with new
possibilities. So that&#39;s when I went
into deep tech and spent all the time
doing science and that&#39;s why when I
built kernel to say how do you pair the
human brain with AI to explore conscious
existence and it took me I mean I sold
really mostly because I knew I I wanted
to dedicate my life to one thing.
I wanted to do something because doing
many things is very hard. One thing is I
yeah I wanted to do that and I really I
thought it would take me 10 years to
find that thing once I got free from
doing that and it was about right I I
found don&#39;t die roughly 10 years after
that and
throughout this entire process I still
have been asking that same question I
you know I find myself conscious
what do I do with my conscious existence
and to me I find it to be the most
beautiful question because There&#39;s an
infinite number of things you can do.
You can pursue wealth. You can write you
can write poetry. You can become a monk.
You can become a fighter. You have all
these infinite paths. And the difference
right now is what I think is I think all
the options that humans have had up
until this point have been conditioned
upon death being inevitable.
And when that comes into question, when
we may know, like when we may be the
first generation who won&#39;t die, I&#39;m
willing to accept that none of those
explanations make sense anymore. None.
That&#39;s the fundamental thing I&#39;m trying
to convey in everything I&#39;m doing.
That&#39;s where I want that&#39;s where I feel
like this transition for me is coming
where I&#39;ve done this basic demonstration
of this new philosophy.
Now I need to go out and just build it
with every single thing I have. That&#39;s
what I feel internally is the move right
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I want to come back to that because I
think it&#39;s important. Um but okay, and
maybe this matters or not, but this this
compulsion, this chasing this this I&#39;m
all in on this one thing. I mean, do you
think that&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if character
flaw is the right word or Yeah. I mean,
it just Do you do you think you&#39;re just
always filling some void and does that
somehow take away from some of the
authenticity of all this or something
like you are just compelled to do this?
I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s
a fair question. Do Do you kind of get
where I&#39;m
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean, I think the the least
qualified person to comment on my
psychological state is me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. you know, like I don&#39;t know if I
can offer any insight on myself. I mean,
there&#39;s there&#39;s times where
where I&#39;ll have enough self-awareness
that I&#39;ll say, man, I&#39;m weird. Like, I&#39;m
really weird. But a lot of the times
that escapes me. You when I interact
with somebody, I perceive it to be a
normal interaction. We&#39;re conversing at
normal things. I&#39;m displaying normal
human characteristics of laughter and
intrigue and but then uh there are
moments I catch myself where I say no I
really am very eccentric. So I&#39;m I&#39;m
open to this idea that I just have this
gap of self lack of self-awareness that
I can&#39;t see myself in these contexts
because some of the when we first
started at Colonel you were very into
the idea we&#39;re going to make this
machine that um is a truth machine. It&#39;s
like we won&#39;t be able to lie to each
other because we&#39;ll be able to read each
other&#39;s minds. You were you were quite
afraid of artificial intelligence or at
least the brand um really at that moment
in time that was most prevalent was was
the idea of companies like Facebook and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; um this algorithm that is just out to to
distract you and tempt you all the time.
And I remember you wanting to fight
against where AI was heading in the
sense of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of it is going to outwit us and sort of
suck our soul down. And then now is it&#39;s
I I imagine you&#39;re still kind of
probably against a lot of that. But um
it&#39;s flipped a little bit where you&#39;re
almost aligned with AI to some degree
because it is this powerful force of
technology that you&#39;re pursuing at the
same time as as this powerful biotech.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Um is that fair? How how is your I feel
like that&#39;s like roughly 2016 to now. So
how has your did I characterize that
right? Has your view on AI changed or
this is all part and parcel of the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you nailed it again. Yeah. So 2016
was when I first started writing about
this and talking about it publicly where
I said AI is an existential threat. Not
because AI is inevitably going to become
rogue, but because of the possibility of
humans using AI for their means, uh,
which are not aligned with humanity&#39;s
best interests. And at that time, it was
companies using the power of technology
to get humans to be addicted to their
technologies and uh, lessen the quality
of their health, which we&#39;ve seen play
out the past years. I think that um for
as many virtues that social media has
offered, it&#39;s created catastrophic
effects for our mental well-being,
societal implications. Like even when
you look at data on how young kids are
now and I still think the premise is
correct. And I would say I&#39;m neither
optimistic or pessimistic about AI. It&#39;s
just a thing. It seems to me it&#39;s
inevitable. the race dynamics are way
too intense to stop. So the idea that
we&#39;re going to somehow not move forward
with AI at a certain speed seems pretty
impractical to me. And so this is what
don&#39;t die is about. It&#39;s it&#39;s making the
observation
this is the most consequential moment in
the history of our species. And
none of us know where it&#39;s going. And
it&#39;s probably worth deep, careful
thought about how we step into the
situation. That&#39;s the entire premise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I I wrote a piece about this on our
Substack. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to
be that articulate on it as I try to
express it here. Um, and I don&#39;t want
this to come off as me um sort of I I
guess gushing about you in in in some
way. And so that that&#39;s my preamble. um
the you know I think what people I think
when some people hear about don&#39;t die
and you talk about it as a cult or
religion I think they are like kind of
in my estimation underestimating sort of
this moment in in some ways. So we had
the singularity has been this idea that
has been floating around for many many
years but really embraced by Silicon
Valley and Silicon Valley tends to be
just to make a broad sweeping
generalization not a terribly religious
place. It&#39;s it&#39;s full of engineers tends
to run along the atheist lines and I I
always thought of the singularity if we
had a religion that that was kind of it.
And it it um and people wanted to kind
of push us towards that. You could say
Ray Kerszswe was maybe the kind of like
a prophet of all that. I mean he he he
codified some of this in his books and
and would speak about this and was that
kind of figure. I don&#39;t think he was
like charismatic enough or um kind of
full, you know, is a bit of a mix.
Anyway, he he was like doing a bit of it
but not like full it. So, so you know, I
think you represent the first person to
I&#39;m not and this is not me over here
saying like, &#34;Oh, don&#39;t die is the
perfect religion. Everybody get on.&#34;
What I&#39;m trying to articulate is I think
you&#39;re the first person to to start
putting some kind of structure, some
kind of thought system around this very
weird moment in time. And like I think
when you say some stuff like that, um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; people Yeah. I think they kind of
misinterpret this a little bit or or I
don&#39;t think they get how serious some of
this is. So I I think you&#39;re building
like the first you&#39;re taking the first
stab at putting this intellectual um
rapper around what I think is like we&#39;re
living in the midst of science fiction
becoming real and the world altering in
such dramatic ways that whatever belief
systems we had before are not really up
to the task. And so, um, so I take this
all quite seriously.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Man, actually, that is so
articulate and I appreciate you so much
for articulating that. It um I really I
sincerely appreciate you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You&#39;re much more articulate than I am.
But I do I do actually I I think um I
think people It&#39;s weird because in some
way you&#39;re not underestimated at all.
You you get tons of attention. people
are very into what you&#39;re doing. I And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think there&#39;s probably some people
that get all this, but then I think
there&#39;s a large part of the world that
still kind of views you through some
some sort of lens. And I guess what I&#39;m
saying is like whether people like you
or not or they think um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when they hear, oh, you want to reverse
your age, they think, oh, this is just
crazy or this is just some rich dude run
muk. It&#39;s kind of like doesn&#39;t matter to
me. I think the the intellectual frame
that you&#39;re building is maybe like what
people should pay attention to.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I mean the to add to yes and what
you said the primary hypothesis is that
AI is going to progress at some speed
and in the coming years. I personally
don&#39;t care whether people think ASI is
going to happen in 2028 or 2035. Doesn&#39;t
matter to me. It&#39;s all the same time
frame to me.
As AI progresses and it it will create
dislocations in society, people will
lose their jobs. We&#39;ll we will do things
differently. The government may do
things differently. We may trust the
government more or less. Institutions
are going to change. Like societyy&#39;s
going to change in ways which we can&#39;t
comprehend. And when that happens,
humans are going to say, &#34;How do I feel
safe and secure? How do I understand the
world? and what is the fabric and the
tapestry that keeps us glued together so
we don&#39;t lose our in some kind of
uh mayhem or chaos. And so what I&#39;m
betting on right now is that dislocation
is coming and it&#39;s going to come very
hard and very fast. We currently have we
don&#39;t have a net to capture it. And I
don&#39;t think that capitalism itself or
democracy itself or socialism itself or
even religions on their own is
sufficient to tie us together and say we
can we can
uh successfully wrestle this moment even
when it&#39;s moving very fast. And so I
think from right now&#39;s perspective you
could look at don&#39;t die and say that&#39;s
kind of weird. I don&#39;t really get it.
But it&#39;s in the moment when the crisises
start happening of, you know, individual
or collective where that opening is
going to come. So I&#39;m really just saying
that it&#39;s coming. There&#39;s going to be
dislocation. We need something to cap
capture that. And
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah, that&#39;s what I think people don&#39;t
get. They you say don&#39;t die. And yes,
okay, there is part of this. Yes, you&#39;re
trying to rejuvenate your body and and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to live longer, but it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s
a uh it&#39;s a mental it&#39;s a flip in your
head, right? Where it&#39;s um Yeah. I just
I don&#39;t think people
I mean, it&#39;s a it&#39;s a philosophy that&#39;s
like acknowledging this sort of sci-fi
future and making you kind of think
about it, right? I mean, that&#39;s sort of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it also gets at these like So,
actually actually I was thinking about
this the other day. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve
been to one of my Don&#39;t Die dinners.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I haven&#39;t, which is crazy. And you&#39;ve
you&#39;ve invited Yes. This is terrible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s terrible. Yeah. the this really
comes through, but you need to sit in
this for about 90 minutes and with about
10 to 15 other people. So I I share
these five thought experiments and then
we roll through them as a group and in
doing that process you&#39;re able to harden
your own perspectives by hearing other
people&#39;s perspectives as you as you
collectively try to solve the puzzles
and I think when you land there on the
other side but the challenge of course
is you can&#39;t get everyone together for
90 minutes to go through these things. I
started training people up to do this,
but it&#39;s it&#39;s quite hard. But yeah, I
would love to have you there because
once you understand the nuances and you
arrive at the end, you&#39;re like,
honestly, this makes a lot of sense.
Very it&#39;s practical. It it&#39;s not woo.
It&#39;s not you have to make a big jump.
It&#39;s just like very very reasonable,
very practical. But yeah, the I when so
in this like tying this back together,
this transition I&#39;m feeling right now is
I really want to spend every single
second every day building don&#39;t die
because I think there&#39;s a possibility
that by you know 2030 there could be a
billion people in the world who
selfidentify with don&#39;t die and maybe
the the identification is something like
I want to be hot that&#39;s don&#39;t die
whereas someone else maybe say I believe
this is the new ideology of our
existence.
anywhere along that spectrum. But a lot
of people say that&#39;s crazy and that&#39;s
that&#39;s not possible. If you think about
co though, for example,
co did something to the world nobody
thought was possible. Everybody&#39;s plans
got put on hold. It didn&#39;t matter who
you are, no matter how much power you
had, your plans were put on hold. And
then the w the world kind of bifrocated
into a few simple opinions. Do you
support uh lockdowns or not? Do you
support masks or not? do you support
vaccines or not? And we kind of had like
six different opinions the entire world.
And I think that AI may present a
similar bifurcation where you know do
you race or do are you trying to do do
something safe and I think people have
trying to take these sides with the
accelerationist and naan. I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s about speed. It&#39;s just about the
methodical way we approach it. is just
doing things to the best of our ability
to try to preserve our existence. And of
course, you branch off into different
complexities. But that&#39;s why I think
this really can become a the world&#39;s
fastest growing ideology. It can happen
in the next few years time and it can
overcome the impossibilities that people
imagine. And so I I do think it&#39;s it&#39;s
worth every single moment I have in in
my existence to go after this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When you say you&#39;re making this shift, I
mean, we we talked about moving away
from the business side.
But then you said you&#39;ve been thinking
about this the last couple days as well.
I mean is there um have you are you
thinking through what this shift is or
the shift is what you&#39;re outlining?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m outlining. So I
we&#39;ve been triing a few different
approaches on don&#39;t die. For example, we
did summits. We brought, you know, 1500
people together. We spent a whole day
together building physical community. We
started uh don&#39;t die events around the
world. We did a version where we we were
doing don&#39;t die fam where every week I
actually built a don&#39;t die fam in Los
Angeles where we get together and we do
these rituals.
We would start by doing a shot of olive
oil. It&#39;s like a ritual and then we
would uh go around in the circle and
apologize to our bodies for something we
did that hurt it and then we would go
around and share something that was you
know on the on our minds for that week.
So it&#39;s more like a combination of
alcoholics anonymous or YPO or like some
event where you get together, you bond
emotionally. You are honest and open.
It&#39;s all confidential. So we try to play
with formats like that. Like can you
spin up these intimate gatherings of
hightouch, high connectivity friendships
more than just a passing you superficial
thing. And so now I&#39;m trying to figure
out do those things matter? So in the
next four years, does it even matter if
we had 50 million people meet up on a
weekly basis or is that irrelevant
relative to a small number of companies
building the technology stack? So really
the question is where is the epicenter
of power and how do you influence that
and I&#39;m not sure yeah how to do it like
it may be the case that humans don&#39;t
individuals don&#39;t matter anymore like
you can&#39;t acquire that power through
individuals and it&#39;s more you need to go
to corporations and say corporations
we need to create a way for companies to
allocate capital towards don&#39;t die or
maybe we need to start a sovereign fund
and try to raise a trillion dollars
where that money is invested and don&#39;t
die. So maybe we go after the allocation
of money. So I&#39;m trying to figure out
where to put the effort because I don&#39;t
want to miss because I could spend years
building up a um a 100 million people or
500 million people meet up on a regular
basis and it has no power that really
matters. So the question is how to
effectively realize power that would
meaningfully influence the probability
that we survive as a species and can
move on into this new expanded
possibilities as uh as humans.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, I want to be mindful of your time
because I know you&#39;re running around
today. Um I feel like you just presented
a lot of stuff. I I I I
because the the the biggest part of
don&#39;t die that I identified with and I
was trying to articulate before is this
is this
creation of a sort of religion and
ideology for our time that is different
than what has come before. There are
bits of it as I understand it. I mean, I
understand the
wanting to kind of take some, okay, the
world is kind of spinning out of
control, so you&#39;re going to take control
of your life and um and and you&#39;re going
to try to to kind of keep up with and
and adjust to this this ever changing
world and embrace parts of it. All that
stuff. I get I do there are times when
I&#39;m like, h this all feels very
solopyistic. you&#39;re just you&#39;re kind of
you end up in this place where you&#39;re
just thinking about yourself all the
time and and and just cuz you have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 100 million a billion people thinking
about themselves together all the time
like where does that sort of end up? I
mean it sounds like you&#39;re
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you&#39;re thinking through
putting these other layers and mechanics
on this thing if I&#39;m interpreting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; exactly right. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s
I I think even those that have the b
most bullish imaginations of AI
positively or negatively I still think
we are all underestimating
what&#39;s going to happen in
the very near you know whether five
years 10 years 15 years whatever I think
we really have underestimated it. Yeah,
I heard you on the Louis threw podcast.
And he&#39;s like, tell me what the future&#39;s
going to be like. And you&#39;re like, I
don&#39;t think anyone can do that. He&#39;s
like, come on, tell me tell me like what
your cell phone&#39;s going to look like. I
was like, I don&#39;t think you get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cuz I agree with you. I I think I think
even though we&#39;ve written decades upon
decades of science fiction with
brilliant people who have proven
themselves of being able to predict the
future quite well. I mean, if if I&#39;m
still not fully convinced, partially
convinced if you know this AI thing,
I see all and I&#39;m sitting here with like
in AI land talking to all the world&#39;s
best people. I I Yeah, I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of
with you. I don&#39;t think anybody I&#39;m
like, if this is really what you guys
are saying, then like
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; nobody has any idea what this is going
to look like cuz what you guys are
talking about is like madness being
unleashed on the world, you know? Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the thought
experiment that really helps clarify
this for me the most is I imagine being
with with Homoctus a million years ago.
And if I could have a dialogue with them
and I could say, I&#39;m really interested
in the future of the species. Tell me
what the future holds. Like, tell me why
I can be excited about the the world.
They would deploy their mental models
and say, you&#39;re going to forage over
there and you&#39;re going to do this and
that. they would not have mental models
of quantum mechanics, of the smartphone,
of the internet, of antibiotics.
And I my almost like my singular insight
that I want to try to put forward is we
may be homo erectus. And if that is the
case, the single best move we can have
as a species is to be humble. And right
now we we&#39;re at the apex of
intelligence. It&#39;s very hard for us to
be humble. We know everything. We we
want to prognosticate and model out and
predict everything. And so don&#39;t die is
really is the most humble observation
one can make about existence. We don&#39;t
know. We just do not know what&#39;s going
to come next. And the only thing we do
know is I don&#39;t want to die right now.
And so it&#39;s trying to be as sober and as
clear-minded as humanly possible in this
moment. Can I just quiet all the noise
and just see this with funeralike
sobriety? Can I just really feel it the
most sober sense possible? What is
happening in this moment?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, it&#39;s like this monastic almost you
just uh
just giving you this one almost like a
meditative one thing to think about to
focus on.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. All right. All right. I know you
have to get somewhere so I&#39;m going to
let you go. I am going to try I&#39;ve
already texted you about this, but I
have found this darkness retreat in
Poland, which I hope to get your take
on, and I&#39;m I&#39;m determined to get you to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is three or seven days of darkness.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, you you have options. There&#39;s this
this gentleman who&#39;s built these,
they&#39;re like hobbit hobbit holes. Um
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; quite fancy hobbit holes. Um yeah, so I
think he does like a week-long retreat,
but you&#39;re not in the darkness the whole
time. The first time you go, you you
sort of meet everybody, you have dinner,
you go in for like an afternoon, you
come out, you meditate. Then the next
day, I think you do like a whole night
all on your own, and then you do this
3-day stretch in the total total
darkness. Um, and they bring food to
your thing through these like, you know,
slats, so no light ever gets in when
they&#39;re bringing the food. But then, you
know, there&#39;s people have done this
before. When I was there, there was a
guy doing 49 days in total. We won&#39;t I
don&#39;t I won&#39;t force force you to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to do that. But um I don&#39;t even know if
I could do this. It was like I I did
like a 10-minute run and it was already
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it was already a little stressful. Um do
you think you could do three days in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, first I&#39;m drawn to it as an
experiment. I would love to measure
everything. What What happens when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, right, right, right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What a what a Yeah, what a cool
experiment. I mean, do they what&#39;s their
pitch? Is it like they&#39;re they&#39;re
advertising a meditative like experience
of reset or is it something else?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It&#39;s kind of like not meditative in some
ways because you&#39;re meant to like really
you know sometimes well there&#39;s
different forms of meditation but the
guy who started it um he&#39;s this really
cool kind of eccentric Polish dude. Um
he had done tons of meditation. He&#39; done
he&#39;s friends with Wimhof. He had done
tons of breath work. all this stuff and
then um ended up settling on this where
you&#39;re not you&#39;re not um even trying to
clear your mind. It&#39;s just you&#39;re not
like fixating on anything sort of like
when you meditate even when you&#39;re
trying to clear your mind you&#39;re kind of
you&#39;re going through this process. This
is more
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you know what you feel very quickly as
anyone will know is like you&#39;ve been
separated from your device even if you
have things to do you can&#39;t do them. So
it&#39;s like it&#39;s sort of the absence of
being able to have any effect on
anything, you know?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So almost like a deprivation tank but
for multiple days.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Right. And then um and then he&#39;s
he&#39;s made these rooms. They&#39;re so nice.
They&#39;re like it&#39;s all round everything&#39;s
rounded and so you can&#39;t hurt yourself
while you&#39;re while you&#39;re kind of
lurching around trying to find the
toilet or anything like that. And then
they have these uh it&#39;s in this Polish
countryside and they have sessions to
talk you through things after. But yeah,
so this this dude AJ, he um I guess he
tried all these things and now he&#39;s he
says the darkness is the only way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I get that&#39;s I wonder if
Yeah, that&#39;s a new form of uh
rejuvenation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I I started looking it up. So there are
I had not actually heard of this a lot
and then now there seem to be I think
it&#39;s a reaction to like our devices in
the modern world. Yeah. So it&#39;s just
like you are you&#39;re hardcore unplugged.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean it&#39;s true. I think I
mean most people I know I don&#39;t know
about you most people I know are pretty
miserable. They feel pretty trapped to
their devices in constant work and never
ending messages and never ending work.
No time to relax. You can never take
off. You&#39;re always the fear of missing
out. It just it&#39;s it&#39;s so insanely uh
escalated that most everyone I know
feels pretty wound up about the
situation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Everyone I know is working like seven
days a week. What like these uh whatever
norms used to exist, this vague like 9
to 5 things. Like the second I wake up
in the morning, I&#39;m getting notes from
all over the world. You got to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; focus on this, focus on that. And then I
mean not breaking new ground here, you
know, I was just at a wedding um sitting
at the bar and it&#39;s like five strangers
and everybody&#39;s just sitting on their
phone and like in the you know, it
wasn&#39;t that long ago
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; people would be talking to each other,
you know, like anytime we&#39;re anywhere
now, you&#39;re just it&#39;s like it&#39;s nicer
just to be on your phone than to like
engage with somebody um because you know
what you&#39;re gonna find on the other end.
Yeah. I mean this can&#39;t again
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is why I think it&#39;s a interesting
if if each one of us individually can
res can spot where we are each an NPC
and where we are original from the
moment you wake up even in your dreams
how much are you basically just playing
out the scripts society has told you to
play in what you write what you do how
you think what you aspire to and I guess
almost like it&#39;s 34 I guess I feel like
I I&#39;m going to that same spot Again, I
want to separate myself and shed the
skin of all these things. Like, I don&#39;t
care what games society is telling me to
play, power, wealth, status. Like, I
just I think they&#39;re all going to be
washed away.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. And so the the the darkness
retreat kind of sounds like a a almost
like a an original approach of how you
reset yourself to give yourself even a a
small hope of having clarity of thought
just for a moment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That&#39;s the idea. All right. I have no
idea how we&#39;re going to film this since
it&#39;s totally dark, but but if you&#39;re up
for it, we&#39;ll try. We can we can put um
some infrared cameras in there so we
wouldn&#39;t see we wouldn&#39;t see the light
and capture it thinking. Yeah. And uh
All right. Well, we will we&#39;re going to
pursue this. We&#39;ll pursue this. Um Brian
Johnson, thank you so much for coming
