<li>This is episode 520 of Pod Strickland podcast, hosted by Shwony Poo with guest Drew (aka Doug)</li>
<li>They are drafting the New York Knicks' 10 best moves from the 2000s (2000-2010 seasons)</li>
<li>The Strickland has a YouTube channel, merchandise store, Patreon with multiple tiers ($6, $9, $15, $30, $50, $100), and Discord community</li>
<li>First pick: Danilo Gallinari - drafted by Knicks, later traded in the Carmelo Anthony deal</li>
<li>Gallinari was considered the best Knicks draft pick of the decade, known for drawing fouls at an elite level</li>
<li>Eric Gordon (picked 7th) and Brook Lopez (picked 10th) were potentially better options than Gallinari (picked 6th)</li>
<li>Second pick: 2007 trade acquiring Zack Randolph - traded Steve Francis, Channing Frye, and 2008 second-round pick</li>
<li>Randolph became a 2-time All-Star and All-NBA third team player after leaving the Knicks</li>
<li>The Knicks were too impatient with Randolph, trading him before seeing his full potential</li>
<li>Randolph's situation parallels the Julius Randle acquisition - undervalued power forward with potential</li>
<li>2005 draft moves mentioned: acquiring Nate Robinson (21st pick) and David Lee through separate trades</li>
<li>Nate Robinson trade: Knicks sent Kurt Thomas and 54th pick to Phoenix for Quentin Richardson and Robinson's draft rights</li>
<li>Richardson was younger (age 25) than Thomas (age 33) but had shooting limitations inside the arc</li>
<li>The Knicks effectively moved up 33 draft spots (from 54th to 21st pick) in the Robinson trade</li>
<li>Kurt Thomas is mentioned as deserving consideration for the top 10 list</li>
<li>The podcast discusses how the Knicks' poor team construction prevented success with acquired talent</li>
<li>Robinson won a dunk contest, adding entertainment value beyond basketball performance</li>
<li>The trades showed occasional smart asset management during an otherwise difficult decade for the franchise</li>

without you so without further ado
This is brought to you by FanDuel. Let&#39;s
get started. Um,
all right. Uh, I will I&#39;m just going to
let you know the first pick here. So, we
are drafting again just to make sure
everybody understands. We are drafting
the Knicks best moves, be it trades, be
it signings,
be it draft picks of the 2000s. So from
from the start of the 2000 and 2001
season to the end of the 2009 2010
season. Uh true go ahead. You get the
number one pick.
I I I guess it&#39;s Danelloo Galinari.
Right. Like I guess um it was between
that and and David Lee and Danilo at
least led to you know Carmelo Anthony
and Knicks fans like Carmelo Anthony for
whatever reason but uh like that that
that&#39;s pretty much like I think that
would be the uh the best pick as of
right now because like we&#39;ll get to more
but I think I think that one&#39;s the
obvious one and I think that&#39;s also
quite sad that it&#39;s Danilo Galinari.
Uh, I had a couple that I had over that
just because I think they were good
trades. But like as far as actually
Yeah. I was trying to I was trying to
number one be a specific draft pick this
like you know just to really hit like
draft pick. I feel like Danilo is the
best of the draft picks.
Yeah. I mean as far as like actually
getting a player that functions on your
team. Uh yeah, I would say Colin is
really good. Uh, the only reason I would
like Well, oh, I gotta be I should be
clear like I thought Colinary was
awesome on the Knicks. I did not like
that the Knicks included him in the
Carmelo Anthony trade. I
I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s aged. I feel
like because he had he had like two
really bad knee injuries in Denver, but
he still was good. Um, I guess it didn&#39;t
age that well. Melo was better than him.
but like I just I I thought Colinary was
a really good Nick. I thought his last
year in New York. Um, I don&#39;t know. I
didn&#39;t like training him then. I just
felt like he was starting to come into
his own. He had some really big moments.
He was kind of developing as far as his
ability to get shots off the bounce. Uh,
he was really really [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] elite at
drawing fouls. Like in incredibly good
at it. Um,
and he was just like a interesting kind
of he&#39;s like a very modern type of
forward that I feel like at that time
was viewed as like he&#39;s a tweener. Like
what is he? And I feel like if he played
now people would just be like he&#39;s like
a four. Like that&#39;s what he is. He&#39;s a
four. Um.
But he he you know he was not a perfect
player. He had obviously issues as far
as like really not a good rebounder. I
thought was a little bit underrated
defensively. Not to say that he was good
defensively, but like I didn&#39;t ever
really feel like he was this disaster
that he often got painted as. I felt
like early in his career, probably
because he was European.
Um, but like I think it&#39;s fair if you
were to just kind of cast a critical eye
at it. the two guys that you could argue
maybe would have been better picks over
him and and you know one of them has I
think unequivocally had a better career
than him. Uh Eric Gordon goes right
after him at number seven and like
Eric Gordon before he got hurt like when
they when the Clippers traded him Eric
Gordon was seen as like
like obviously you&#39;re getting Chris Ball
so it&#39;s like okay you give up Eric
Gordon like who cares. Um I think it&#39;s
easy to view it like that in retrospect
but like at the time that was like not a
straightforward decision. Eric Gordon in
his third year with the Clippers
averaged 22 uh points per game, four and
a half assists. He was on 45 36 and a
half splits from the field. Um like he
was seen as
this guy&#39;s probably going to be a future
all-star two guard. Um obviously the
injuries changed the trajectory of his
career, but like I think that would have
been probably the guy that I I don&#39;t I&#39;m
trying to remember what I wanted them to
do. I mean I wanted them to [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
trade up. that I remember that. But they
weren&#39;t they weren&#39;t able to trade up.
Um and then Kevin Love got taken right
before they picked. That was kind of
like who you were hoping might fall to
Um but like I think I was f I was fine
with Galinari. I didn&#39;t have an issue
with the pick because I just felt like,
you know, he&#39;s a sniper and I kind of
just trusted that like there was enough
pedigree there. Um but I think I wanted
Gordon because I just remember him at
Indiana being like a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] awesome one
and done in eight as well. Yeah.
Yeah. So, I was like pretty in on
Gordon. I think I feel like that maybe
would have been the best pick. Again,
like who&#39;s to say because it ends up
like Gordon kind of has like this loss
two years right after that. In 2011 12
he plays nine games. The year after that
he plays 42 games.
Um like he bounced around and or not
bounced around but he had a lot of
injury issues. Um whatever. Anyway, uh
so that would have been one guy and then
the other guy who I think no question
ends up having a better career albeit in
a very very weird career arc is Brook
Lopez who goes 10th.
Yeah. The only guy who would be that&#39;s
the only better guy after
like like 100 like absolutely 100%
better Lopez. But like very weird career
arc. the odds that he would have seen
out that arc in New York are very slim.
Um he probably still like he probably is
a guy that goes out in the mellow trade.
Um you know maybe maybe that helps you
keep Mazgo. I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s so
many moving pieces there. But like
he probably goes out in a mellow trade.
Um it would have been interesting to see
him with Deanton though. I will say that
just because I feel like the Antony
would have had him stretch out his range
to three a lot earlier in his career.
Yeah. Than he ended up doing so. Um but
obviously if those are the nitpicks, I
feel like the Knicks picking Dolinary
ends up being a pretty solid pick.
The only guy after that that&#39;s drafted
that makes an all-star team, I believe,
Roy Hibbert who goes 17th.
I don&#39;t
Serge Batum ever made
I don&#39;t think Serge did. I think Batum
did once in the East when the East suck.
yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking. And
then there&#39;s uh what&#39;s his name?
That&#39;s like a D Allstar.
Then Dragage was second round.
Yeah, Dragage a second round. DeAndre
Jordan a second round. like but it&#39;s
like these guys got picked so much
further after him that I&#39;m just not I&#39;m
not gonna I mean I just feel like it&#39;s
insane to cry about that. Um but yeah,
so the Knicks picked well here. He&#39;s a
good player for the Knicks. I thought he
was a really fun Nick actually and you
know it just sucks like the
circumstances kind of when he got
drafted and just how they were operating
as a franchise and everything he goes on
the melo trade so you don&#39;t really get
to see his full development but um yeah
he was a fun Nick he was a fun Nick and
he was definitely I mean as far as I&#39;m
concerned he was their best draft pick
over that decade which again isn&#39;t
saying much considering
a lot of things that happened in that
decade but yeah uh a fine a fine number
one selection.
closed out the Nuggets season with a
free throw rate of uh a 77 which is
hilarious in the 14 games and then he
had a stretch during the basically the
2015 16 and 1617 season uh 61.7 and then
51.6. You know what I mean? Like this
man like he he he got to the free throw
Oh yeah. Galinari there&#39;s one thing that
man did was get to the free throw line.
Yeah. So
he got injured. I think that&#39;s just kind
of like Gordon, right? Like those two
guys, they like they got injured before
they really came into their own because
you just kind of saw glimpses of what
how good they were when they were
healthy like randomly throughout their
career like, &#34;Oh yeah, these guys were
Yeah, no question. Um it was uh
Yeah, I mean I I feel like he would have
become an all-star at some point. not
like a, you know, 10 time all-star song,
but I feel like he would have gotten one
or two allstars if he didn&#39;t get hurt
and he hung out in the East. Um,
yeah, I would think so.
Obviously, that was
Did Kyle Corer make it? Like Kyle Corver
made it, right?
Yeah. Well, that was when they they
picked all like the entire
Hawk starting five. Got to have them
all. Um,
all right. Uh, we good. We&#39;re good on
the Golden.
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s my first pick.
Okay. I will go with the second pick and
I&#39;m gonna switch it up. This actually
was not the guy. This is not the move I
would have picked number one overall,
but I&#39;m going to pick this now having
thought about it a little bit more. Even
though this did not work out for the
I am comfortable saying that this was
actually a great move and they were
simply too impatient to reap the
benefits of it.
in sorry one second uh just got to pull
this up here
because I want to get all the details
Okay. In the
at the 2007 draft, effectively,
the Knicks
trade Steve Francis, Channing Fry, a
2008 second round pick, which was the
Knicks a second round pick for
Dan Dau, Fred Jones, the draft rights to
Demetus Nichols,
and Zack Randolph.
Um, I think this was a [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] awesome
trade. Like, they gave up Steve
Francis&#39;s corpse. Channing Fry, who was
a good player, went on to have a solid
career, but never came close to being as
good of a player as Zack Randolph, uh,
and a second round pick for a guy who
ends up in his career making two
All-Star teams in the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] West. Uh,
he makes all NBA third team one season.
Uh, Zack Randolph was like really good
and the Knicks got him at a point where
he was an undervalued asset because he
had off-the- court issues. Uh, he was
coming off a season in 2006 2007. He
averaged 23 and a half and 10 points or
23 and a half points, 10 rebounds. Um,
you know, again, his efficiency was
never the best, but Randolph was like a
very effective old school power forward
who managed to stick around in the
league. And after the Knicks trade him
in 2008, 2009, I mean, he&#39;s in the
league for almost another decade. He&#39;s
in the league for another nine years.
And again, he he makes the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
All-Star team the year after the Knicks
trade him. He he goes, this is what he
does. the the the the four years after
the next trade him, he makes two
All-Star teams and he makes an AllNBA
third team in one of the seasons also
and that was a separate so he didn&#39;t
make the All-Star team in that year,
funny enough, but he so two years as an
all-star and then one year as an all-NBA
13 player. um that was in the four
seasons if right after the Knicks traded
him. Like they were not patient enough
to reap the benefits of it. And quite
honestly, their team construct when they
acquired Zack Randolph made it basically
impossible for like his career would not
have played out the same way unless they
made big moves to like reshape the
roster around him or at least with him
in mind. Um, like I don&#39;t think Zack
Randolph has the same career without,
you know, getting to Memphis, right? And
playing with Mark Gasol, right? Who
could like protect him defensively in a
way that certainly
um Eddie [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] Curry
and Jerome Yeah. and Jerome [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
James were not going to be doing. So
like he there&#39;s almost no chance he has
this career in New York. But they got
him at age 20. like he was 26 in his one
full year in New York. That was his age
26 season. They got him in the prime of
his career for again Channing Fry, the
corpse of Steve Francis and the second
round pick. That&#39;s a great trade. That&#39;s
a great trade. And of course, like the
Knicks being the Knicks at that time
period, they don&#39;t reap any of the
benefits of it. They don&#39;t reap any of
the benefits of buying this guy at his
low basically. Um and they they pass on
those benefits to another team. Um, you
know, they trade him to the Clippers and
then he gets moved to the from the
Clippers to the Grizzlies and whatever,
but he&#39;s a highly productive player. I
mean, Zack Randolph was just a highly
productive player and um, you know, the
Knicks got none of that. They they they
got none of the production bar uh, a
nice 11ame stint to start the 2008 2009
season. We already talked about this in
the worst moves uh draft, but
yeah, Zach Crystal, I I&#39;m I&#39;m going to
pick that as a number two pick just cuz
I think if you pick up an all-star
like they basically did the Randall
thing. This is like what they did with
Randall except they actually held on to
Randall. So they event they and they
they got they they held on to Randall,
then they got competent management and
then they hired a competent coach and
they were like and then they had a
defensive center and it was like so they
got the benefit of that whereas like the
like the Knicks did the part like they
like got the undervalued power forward
who had potential right in the prime of
his career. like they get him right in
the prime of his career except
after like a miserable first year in New
York rather than holding on to him the
Knicks immediately trade him as soon as
possible. Um so kind of an interesting
parallel there but yeah so that that
that will be my second pick overall.
That&#39;s a good one. Um
yeah, you know, you kind of think about
it. It really is like a it was a proto
Randall. I never really thought of it
that way, but it really was like a proto
Randall where it&#39;s like you you just bet
on a guy for just being talented. You&#39;re
just like, it&#39;s got to work out. And it
really did work out for Randall.
It worked out [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] great for It
worked out great for the Knicks. It
worked out great for Randall.
I don&#39;t It&#39;s crazy. So,
the second one, this is what I&#39;m I&#39;m
torn between right now for my for my
second pick, is
do I divide the 2005 draft
into two separate things? You know what
I mean? Because
I believe those are two separate deals
to get them both Nate Robinson and David
Lee in that draft. like that&#39;s a really
good draft like to come out of that, but
I&#39;m trying to remember the uh the
specific details and I&#39;m like looking
through the uh
to get Nate to get Nate Robinson
the Yeah, they go through the trade
stuff and it&#39;s just
I have this I I have this because this
was one of my uh this is one of my
tents. So, give me one second. I&#39;ll
Yeah. Okay, go for because that&#39;s that&#39;s
the I would just say the 2005 draft is
just they played it so well because I
think they uh it was they got
the trade was the trade was uh hold on
the Knicks traded Kurt Thomas and the
draft rights to Deon Thompson who was
like the 54th pick or something in the
um to the Suns that on draft night for
Quentyn Richardson who was coming off
like a really nice season with the Suns
uh and the draft rights to Nate Robinson
and they got cash in this deal. I&#39;m not
sure why they got cash in this deal.
Uh but Nate Robinson was the 21st pick
overall in that draft. So they basically
took they swapped Thomas and Quenton
Richardson.
I feel like I if I remember correctly at
the time Richardson was seen as the
better player, but his contract was
longer and had more money left on it. So
yeah, he had a crappier contract. So, it
was like the Suns were kind of trying to
get off the money there. Um, and then
they basically moved up 33 picks in the
draft for that, right? They get they go
from 54 to 21. So, yeah. I mean, I
definitely had this on there. I This
would not have been my pick here, but I
think this was like this was like a
really good trade for the Knicks at the
time. I I thought so.
Yeah. So, like I it wasn&#39;t a part of the
the two weren&#39;t part of the deal, so I&#39;m
not even going to include them. But like
that was the Goodwood. They didn&#39;t have
their uh they didn&#39;t have any of their
picks that year. I&#39;m trying to remember
where it was in the first place, but
like they didn&#39;t have anything going for
them and they just made those picks out
of thin air. So, I&#39;m just like gotta go
with that. And Nate Robinson, you know,
won a dunk contest, so I get more points
than uh David Lee being an all-star.
So that&#39;s that&#39;s where I would go. I
just I just like the uh the insanity of
the uh the trade because actually there
was some logic to it surprisingly from
Isaiah Thomas.
Well, it made a lot of sense. Quentyn
Richardson was I&#39;m got to pull this up.
I I mean I&#39;m pretty confident that
Richardson was not just he was pretty
significantly younger than Kurt Thomas
at the time I believe. Uh, so Quent
Richardson when he gets traded,
he gets traded entering his age 25
season with New York. The year before in
Phoenix, that was his fifth year in the
league, but he averaged uh 15 and six
and he shot 36% from three the year
before. His problem, uh, which remained
a problem in New York and was a problem
his entire career, is Quent Richardson
was [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] dreadful inside the ark.
just an absolutely dreadful player
inside the arc.
Uh he is a career 43% shooter from
two-point range.
He has a career sub 40% from the field.
Like just a and he was a 35 and a half%
three-point shooter. So he&#39;s not like
he&#39;s like a pretty solid three-point
shooter. Um but just absolutely nothing.
No game inside the ark. None at all. um
and weirdly like a very substandard free
throw shooter. He was a just under 72%
for his career. So kind of a weird
player, but um I mean I remember the
Knicks making this trade at the time and
like I I wouldn&#39;t say that I was like
I I think my reaction was like because I
really like Kurt Thomas and I we will I
will talk about Kurt Thomas later
because I think that he deserves a shout
here. Um, but like it just made sense to
move on from him. Like you kind of
needed to turn over the roster. You&#39;re
getting a guy coming off of probably one
of his best seasons. Uh, and you&#39;re he&#39;s
entering his age 25 season. Kurt Thomas
entering the 2004 2005 season or sorry,
entering the 2005 2006 season. That was
his age 33 season. So he&#39;s he&#39;s entering
his age 33 season, his first year out of
New York. Like
so you you&#39;re swap you&#39;re gaining eight
years of a player in the transaction.
Like it just made sense. Um so yeah, no,
I agree. I mean you got maybe not the
better player, but the player who made
more sense for you and you actually
traded Kurt Thomas at
I don&#39;t want to say peak value, but
really good value. Like you got younger.
you got younger and you moved up 34
spots in the draft. Like you effectively
trade like a UDFA level player to move
up in the first round to move up into
the late first. Like that&#39;s a really
good trade.
