Hello everyone. Hi. Welcome to Lelay&#39;s
Saturday Night Live. I&#39;ve had a bad hair
So, here I am. All right. So, um let&#39;s
get started. If you ask me what&#39;s the
next biggest event to watch in CCP
politics, I&#39;d say it&#39;s the Beijing&#39;s uh
September 3rd military parade. All eyes
are are on the parade. While CCP parades
aren&#39;t just about showing off missiles
and tanks, they are political theater.
They are also a weather vein of power
struggles. So for Xiinping&#39;s supporters,
the parade is a chance to show he&#39;s
still in control.
also to silence rumors that he&#39;s being
sidelined. For the party elders, it it&#39;s
meant to project party unity. For
anti-shi forces, it&#39;s a rare shot at
toppling him. But for Xiinping himself,
it could be the most dangerous parade
he&#39;s ever attended. So, let me explain
why. Now, behind the risk of a coup,
there is the risk of public anger
spilling over. Recently, Beijing ordered
people to register with their real names
to use public bathrooms. Yes, you have
to use an app to scan your name before
entering public bathrooms. Why? Because
there&#39;s a a bathroom revolution.
let me here, let me maybe show you this.
Um, this bathroom revolution has started
in Beijing. Toilet doors and walls have
become bulletin boards for free
expression.
Graffiti with political messages that
cannot survive online censorship have
show up in these public places.
let me show you some of the messages
here. So, you could see that people have
uh here are two and then there are Yeah,
this this one is is is hilarious. And
then yeah, anyways, so
there&#39;s also one that I&#39;ve seen that&#39;s
not on the slide. It simply said 93
targets she. 93 means September 3rd
parade. So it&#39;s essentially saying
September 3rd parade targets Xiinping.
Now let me talk about the
let me talk about the parade itself. The
parade will last about 70 minutes with
45 formations, some marching soldiers,
some weapons on display. The highlight
is supposed to be uh Xiinping revealing
the troops. Let me show you some slides.
Here we go. Yeah.
So, here are some pictures taken from
the rehearsals. I don&#39;t know what these
women um I I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t know
the role they play in the Chinese PLA
because to me they don&#39;t like they don&#39;t
look like soldiers at all.
Anyways, um yeah, so these are some of
the rehearsal photos that we&#39;ve seen.
So, um, the highlight is supposed to be
Xiinping reviewing the troops lined up
on Chan Avenue in front of Tanaman.
But will he stand in
uh in one of those open top vehicle
moving in front of the the troops or
will he stay stay safely
on Teneaman Gate? uh the government
didn&#39;t say or won&#39;t say anything about
how he will inspect the troops. Now the
units involved
um came from all over China.
Uh let me just show you.
I like to show these women.
I mean they I mean I think these are
just I don&#39;t know what maybe they&#39;re
from the sauna and dance troops but they
were already disbanded by Xiinping. Who
knows? But they found all these pretty
women in the PLA. Anyways um so the
units the units participating in the
parade um came from all over from
different theater commands and even
militia groups from 15 provinces.
Um now not all of them are loyal to
Will they hide some live ammunitions?
Uh that&#39;s a scary thought. In fact, we
don&#39;t even know if he will be uh the
ones inspecting the troops. He may not
want to because he fears for his life.
Uh but politically he may have no
choice. Meanwhile, Beijing has seen
internet outages. uh a successive number
of internet outages,
night curfews, bathroom restrictions,
and heavy troop movements. Jangua has
openly bypassed Xiinping, shuffling
units around, even bringing special
forces into Beijing. And right in
Tiennaman Square, ammunition and weapons
are reportly stored in bunkers under
Jung Shan Park with thousands of troops
stationed uh stationed underground in
the underground structure in Jung Shan
Park. There&#39;s a massive underground
structure underneath that park which is
only about um one kilometer away from
Jonah which is about 6 of a mile. Yeah,
a little more than half a mile. It&#39;s
very close. So, the this troop that&#39;s uh
stationed in the underground structure
in this Don Shan Park, their unit isn&#39;t
clear. We&#39;re not sure if if they are the
part of the 82nd group army or not, but
their presence is making leaders in
nearby Jonah very nervous. Um, now you
have to know that real ammo
hasn&#39;t been brought this close to the
leadership compound in decades. So, some
say Janga is using parade prep to sneak
Trojan horses into Beijing. And then
there was a chilling line uh from the
parade leader of Jang Yo&#39;s elite 82nd
Group Army. His name is Ding. I I don&#39;t
I forgot his first name, but his last
name is Ding uh Ding something. Yeah.
But he he said this. Okay. He said, &#34;We
are prepared to transition from parade
mode into combat mode.&#34; I mean, think
about it. That&#39;s a scary line for
Xiinping to hear. Okay. I mean, on the
surface, it sounds like he is or he was
proud of his unit, their ability, right?
Because after all, a military parade is
to show off their military capability.
So it&#39;s not wrong for him, you know,
from the PR perspective to say that
we&#39;re so strong, we&#39;re so prepared that
we&#39;re that we are utterly prepared to
transition from parade mode into combat
mode. But the underlying message
seriously is a warning to Xiinping. And
this is being uttered by the man who
heads the most formidable unit uh the
82nd group army which is under control
of Jang Yosha which is the elite CCP
troops I mean so here&#39;s the qu big
question will Xiinping actually dare to
inspect the troops or will something
happen during the parade itself
insiders say the parade command already
drew up contingency plans. So they came
up with three scenarios. Scenario number
um scenario number one is that Xiinping
presides over the parade, gives the
speech, reviews the troops. Um his
propaganda teams are working nonstop to
push this version. Scenario number two
is if Xiinping falters, Jang Yo Xia
takes over,
he will inspect the troops. Um,
and this is what the military prefers.
Uh, they wanted Jang to uh to review
them, to review the troops. Um,
so if he takes the stage,
it screams one thing. Coup, right? If
John does um takes does take the stage,
then there&#39;s nothing else. I mean, it&#39;s
just it just spells one word, coup. And
there&#39;s a scenario number three. it&#39;s
that neither Xiinping nor Jang Yosha
uh does it.
Um and that that&#39;s when uh this chief of
Leo Jun Lee, General Leo Jun Lee steps
in. That&#39;s if both Jango and Xiinping
are stuck in a conflict,
then this that&#39;s the safe option.
um he doesn&#39;t steal the spotlight. He
doesn&#39;t spark uh any succession talk. He
is someone that the P can accept. So, he
is a a safe option.
Um but here&#39;s the irony. None of these
options fix the problem. If Xiinping
appears, he&#39;s a target. If nothing
happens, he still risks looking weak. If
Jaya appears, it&#39;s open rebellion. If Li
lie appears, it means the first two
couldn&#39;t even agree uh on the on the
parade. And there&#39;s even talk of a
fourth scenario. That&#39;s a strange one.
Um it says that all four remaining CMC
uh do I have a picture of them? Yes, I
do. That&#39;sin
all appear together in a group
inspection.
Um they may have Xiinping ride in the f
in the first car and they have the other
three generals uh ride in in cars behind
him. Um so it&#39;s a a group inspection. Um
to the outside world it it wouldn&#39;t look
like unity. I mean although they it it
shows it shows up as a group but it
looks kind of weird. It doesn&#39;t look
like a unity at all. Um it it may look
like Shiin Ping being restrained by the
military because it looks like you know
he will be in the in in the first car
and maybe the other three guys in the
car following him. So So it looks like
he&#39;s they are looking after him. He&#39;s
being restrained by the other three. Um,
and behind the scenes, uh, it&#39;s said
that morale is low. Officers say the
hardest part of rehearsals isn&#39;t
marching or maneuvers. It&#39;s shouting
slogans. Uh, troops sound weak, off
rhythm, unmotivated.
So, there has been there have been talks
about just playing a recording and have
the soldiers lip sinking. So, you could
tell uh this parade is supposed to show
strength, but instead it may just expose
how fragile the PLA and Xiinping&#39;s grip
on power really is. And that&#39;s not the
only problem. Okay, that&#39;s just very
superficial problem. The biggest issue
is that the parade marshal still hasn&#39;t
been named. In every CCP military
parade, the parade marshall is crucial.
Think of him as the conductor who pulls
everything together and he is the one
who sits in the car right besides the
parade chief commander that&#39;s Xin Ping
in this case this year that means
sitting next to Xiinping in the front in
the front passenger seat right there
will be the driver and then there&#39;s the
parade marshal sitting next to the
driver and Xiinping is in the back seat
that&#39;s the usual arrangement but in 2025
Five, the identity of the parade
marshall has become a political mystery.
Traditionally, the role has always be
has always gone to a senior general.
Let&#39;s take a look at the history. So, in
fourth year
after the CCP uh seized power, it was uh
guess who? Jang Yu Xia&#39;s father um
General Jang Jong Jang Jonging who was
the deputy chief of staff at the time.
He was the uh the parade marshal. And
then fast forward to 1984 when Deniaing
then 80 inspected the troops. It was
Chiniwi commander of the Beijing
military region.
Okay. Um and then in 2009
uh Huin Tao was parade leader and then
his parade marshall was Fongi who was
the commander of um also yeah the
commander of the Beijing military
Um and then in 2015, Xiinping, it was
the first time Xiinping would um as the
parade leader, his parade marshall was a
a name, a guy by the name of Sunuan,
who was also the Beijing military region
commander.
Okay. And then came 2016, oh no 2019,
um, when Xiinping inspected the troops,
his marshall was EA, commander of the
central theater command. So the pattern
is clear. Before Xiinping&#39;s military
reforms, the marshall was almost always
the Beijing military region commander.
After Xiinping&#39;s reforms, it shifted to
the central theater command commander.
So here we are in 2025. The CCP has
confirmed that Xiinping will review the
troops, but curiously they haven&#39;t named
the marshall. By convention, it should
be the central theater commander.
Problem is, no one knows who that is.
Last July, official reports said that
Hanging, the central theater commander
at the time, had been transferred to the
Northern Theater.
Here&#39;s Huang Ming.
and then
came rumors that Wang, the northern
theater commander, had been reassigned
to replace Hangaming.
Um, so the two basically swapped jobs,
right? The the commander of the northern
and the central commands swapped their
jobs, but one was confirmed. Um, hanging
was confirmed, but as far as who
actually assumed the role of the
commander of the central command, it was
it was only a rumor. Beijing never
confirmed it officially. Uh,
no, here&#39;s Wang Chang. Sorry, I I got
Yeah, this is this is the guy confirmed.
This is the guy who was the central
theater command commander sorry and he
moved to the northern theater and Wang
was rumored to move from the north to to
the central but it was not confirmed. It
was a rumor only.
and then this man
is officially listed as the central
theater political commasar.
Um, but the commander&#39;s chair is still
is is Wang really the commander of the
central theater and the new marshall in
waiting? That&#39;s where it gets murky. Um,
people do not believe he is. This is
because at the Army Day reception on
July 31st in the great hall of the
people, remember I told you nine full
generals were absent. I I talked about
this a week ago, uh maybe more than a
week ago. Um now the nine full generals
who were missing included
um the commander, the suspected
commander of the central command and its
political commissar. So Wang Chang and
Shuing were both missing from that key
event celebrating I don&#39;t know the 98th
s anniversary of the PLA. So their
absence looks ominous. It suggests that
they may already be finished which means
the central theater has no commander and
no commasar and no one to serve as
parade marshal. or the other
possibilities. It has a commander, it
has a commasar. It&#39;s just that they
cannot be announced because once they
are announced, it does not make put
Xiinping in a good in a good place. So
maybe I&#39;m not saying that they
absolutely don&#39;t have uh a commander.
They they may do, but they&#39;re just not
being announced.
So, but let&#39;s just assume that they
don&#39;t because we have not heard
anything. Now, could a deputy commander
step in? Not anymore. Because the
lieutenant general Lee Jung, who is or
who was the deputy commander of the
central theater, was purged in February
Yeah, here. Here he is. Um, the National
People&#39;s Congress stripped his delegate
status and official confirmation of his
So what about the Beijing garrison?
Another traditional fallback, right?
That door is shut too. Its last
commander Fua,
who is a close ally of Jang Yua, has
been moved uh here&#39;s Fua has been moved
in March to the people&#39;s armed police as
deputy commander. people believe he&#39;s
playing the role of the commander um
because the commander has been missing.
So, he&#39;s made the deputy commander, but
he&#39;s just doing the commander&#39;s job. Um
and his replacement as the head of the
Beijing garrison still unannounced.
So, here we are just days away from the
parade. Xiinping has been announced as
the parade chief commander, but the
marshall, the man who should sit beside
him, signaling command and confidence,
remains a mystery. And in Beijing&#39;s
political theater, sometimes the loudest
message isn&#39;t in the speeches or the
slogans. Sometimes it&#39;s in the empty
seat. And right now there are a shocking
number of empty seats in the PLA.
Let me lay out the record. So first
let&#39;s talk about the confirmed purges
of um make this bigger.
Um these are the confirmed purges of
four generals. So there are former
defense ministers,
former air force commander,
former rocket force commander
and joying
uh CMC political work department chief,
former strategic support force commander
uh and former rocket force political
okay and these are the confirmed
following lieutenant generals. They are
former rocket force deputy commander
Jang Jun and Lee Leanguang.
uh former rocket force chief of staff,
former CMC equipment develop development
deputy ministers,
Jang Anju, former Army Deputy Commander,
former Southern Theater Navy Commander,
former Army Deputy Commander, former
Central Theater Deputy Commander Liong,
the the man I mentioned in my uh in my
previous slide or even yeah before that.
Okay. So now let&#39;s talk about the
confirmed. These are all confirmed
confirmed uh major generals. Former
rocket force equipment department chief
former CMC equipment development deputy
Former rocket force equipment de
department deputy minister. Yeah, there
two of them. So
those are all confirmed. Now, let&#39;s talk
about disappeared ones.
These are the ones who who have been
rumored to have been taken down, but
there there are no official
confirmations yet. We have CMC vice
right? former army political commar
navy political commar
western theater commander
former theater eastern theater
commanding this is the this is the man
in charge of um military operations
against Taiwan southern theater
commander Wanging CMC political and
legal affairs chief CMC political work
department executive deputy director
uh hunging
Yeah, this is the man who&#39;s supposedly
to replace me.
Um, and then uh uh PAP uh uh armed for
armed police force commander and its
political commissar
rocket force commander.
Oh, next one. I mean, yeah, they&#39;re just
I don&#39;t think I need to read you all the
names because they&#39;re a lot and I don&#39;t
Okay, so
there they are. Uh you could read the
names. Um there includes some retired
uh generals who were rumored to be taken
And of course the most famous one, Leo
Yao, son-in-law of former state
president Lie and former political
commissar of the national defense
university who was rumored to be given
um a life sentence for being against war
uh for being against military operations
um in the Taiwan Strait. So, now we see
why the parade marshall still hasn&#39;t
been named. The truth is simple. The PLA
is running out of leaders.
Um, the military is in the middle of yet
purge, right? Xiinping launched round
after round of purges. Now, Jang Yua is
hitting back, purging she&#39;s allies. So,
no matter which side is doing it, the
result is the same. The PLA leadership
is in shambles.
And add up the numbers. If you add up
all the names that I showed you, the
scale is staggering since the 20th Party
Congress. And that&#39;s only three years
ago. 44 senior generals have fallen in
just three years. Of course, some some
are rumors, right? Some are not
confirmed. But in CCP&#39;s business when
they do not come out to deny the rumors
that means they admitted they admitted
them. Um so 44 generals have have fallen
in just three years and before that
Xiinping&#39;s
during Xiinping&#39;s first decade of rule
from 2013
so from 2012 to 2022. So in that 10
years somebody did the tally he took
down about 160 generals. So in total 200
generals purged under sheep. That&#39;s more
than the casualties of a war. You know
casualties of generals of a war. Um the
purge has thrown into an army of its
own. This is why Xiinping is deeply
unpopular inside the PLA and why people
say he should be worried for his own
safety on September the 3. Um when so
many units converge in Teneaman Square
in front of him. Um and those numbers
that I gave you don&#39;t even include
demotions.
So let me take let me give you one
example. So this man is
um he
supposedly is the director of the CMC&#39;s
general office. Um he is like the chief
of staff for Xiinping uh in the in the
military. And on August 20th uh when
Xiinping went to Tibet in to visit Lassa
to attend the event
um state media showed that he he didn&#39;t
go with Xiinping but his deputy uh major
general Chuang went in his place. So
Fong himself was missing.
rumor in uh in March and April already
claimed that Funia had been had been
sent to the Academy of Military
Uh he&#39;s a close ally to the disgraced
generals like Mia and Hiong uh because
they all came from Xiinping&#39;s old 31st
group army in Fuian, right? Um, so now
the CMC general office director is often
called the chief steward of the
military. He shadows the CMC chairman
Xiinping on all trips. Um, he was last
seen with Xiinping back on March 20th in
Quiming. He accompanied him to Yinan on
that trip, but since then he has he has
disappeared.
Um so there there have been multiple
whistleblowers claiming that he had been
dismissed and quietly transferred.
Um interestingly his predecessor
who I have a picture for you here
accidentally appeared in press recently
but not in the powerful role he once
held. He has been reassigned as
political commissar of the national
defense university. a clear demotion in
April 2024. That&#39;s more than a year ago,
but it was only a rumor. Now, this is
confirmed. How do we confirm this? The
picture you&#39;re looking at was actually
released by Singapore&#39;s Ministry of
Defense on August the 19th. its um
permanent secretary. His name is Chungi
Chungi maybe um the defense minister
uh came to Beijing for a visit and he
visited his counterpart defense minister
Dong Jing along with several other
generals including Jung Xiao Jing. Yet
the Chinese media
skipped Jong in its press release. They
released photos of the meetings. Um uh I
think this uh Singaporean defense
minister met with four generals. So the
Chinese only showed photos of three of
them. they purposely dropped Xiao Jin
whereas the Singaporean defense ministry
released the all the the photos of uh of
all four of them right um so that&#39;s a
contrast and then when people try to
Google Jun Xiao Jun&#39;s name
on Chinese way
it says says, &#34;Sorry, no relevant
results found.&#34; So that means Jun Xiao
Jin has been completely scrubbed um from
social media. Um now think about it.
These are Xiinping&#39;s closest military
aids that are now demoted, sidelined, or
erased. And this is the cruel reality of
the PLA. So who knows if things will
look ugly on September the 3. Anything
is possible. And here&#39;s the bitter
irony. Um, the parade on September 3rd
is meant to celebrate the 80th
anniversary of the victory in the war of
resistance against Japan
during World War II. But the CCP didn&#39;t
actually fight Japan. If anything, it
colluded with Japanese forces to
undermine the national nationalist army.
Um there&#39;s um a professor scholar in
Japan. Her name is Ando Homari.
Um she is a professor at Japan&#39;s
University of uh Tsukuba.
She published a book titled Maong, the
man who conspired with the Japanese Army
10 years ago in 2015
using sources from China, Taiwan, and
Japan. She documented how Maadong and
the CCP worked with Japanese
intelligence in Shanghai to sabotage the
nationalists.
After founding the PRC, Maudon even
thanked visiting Japanese for their
invasion, saying that it allowed him to
push the ROC to Taiwan. So given that
history, any world leader attending the
CCP&#39;s parade is, whether they realize it
or not, standing with the biggest liar
in modern Chinese history. So let&#39;s talk
about who&#39;s coming. Well, Vladia Putin
will be the star guest. Uh without
question, he will be there. Slovakia&#39;s
prime minister Robert Fiko and Serbia&#39;s
uh Alexander I think Vushik I don&#39;t am I
saying right Vik Vuchik are confirmed
and Belarusian president Alexander
Lucashenko
received a personal invitation from
Xiinping in June he&#39;s almost certainly
uh he would show up for sure and from
Asia Indonesia&#39;s President, Malaysia&#39;s
Prime Minister, Vietnam&#39;s president, and
leaders of Cambodia, Laos, and Myammar
may stop by after the Shanghai
Cooperation Summit in Tenzing.
It&#39;s said that the CCP purposely
um moved the Shanghai Cooperation Summit
to Tiening, which is so close to
Beijing, so that the the world leaders
attending the summit uh would would be
encouraged to go to Beijing for the
parade. Uh if not, then they probably
wouldn&#39;t get
wouldn&#39;t get many world leaders at the
parade at all.
But did you notice something? No major
Western leaders will be in attendance.
In fact, European diplomats in Beijing
are even discussing a collective boycott
specifically because Putin will be
there. Um, so on September the 3rd,
Xiinping may march to applause or to his
downfall. The question isn&#39;t whether the
parade happens but whether
it will end his rule.
So um uh speaking of military parade
that ended um
people ended a regime or some leaders
rule. We have an example in October 1981
uh assassination of Egyptian leader
Sada. Right? It was during Egypt&#39;s
annual military parade. Uh Islamist army
officers turned their weapons on um on
the um Egyptian president.
So that&#39;s that&#39;s a precedence in the
past. So um that&#39;s all I have for you
I don&#39;t have a good feeling about this
parade. I mean, just to be honest with
you, I really I really worry what will I
I think Xiinping worries about his
safety more than anyone else. I mean,
but I mean, he he he wanted to attend
the parade, now he got it, and now it
just looks like it it&#39;s not very safe
for him to go. Um, so now he probably
regrets it, but it&#39;s too late. You You
get what you asked for. So, um, that&#39;s
that&#39;s the situation. Okay, that&#39;s all I
have for you.
All right,
let&#39;s see what people have for me.
All right, qu I&#39;m going to pick some
random questions.
Uh, here we Chris are forwarding me
questions.
Oh, uh, that&#39;s not a question. That&#39;s
just a greeting. Oh, I thank people for
call uh for uh after we after someone
calling me a alpha female, I actually
got an email from uh from a fan who is
from the Pacific Northwest. She sent me
a video explaining six types of six
types of personalities of women from
alpha to sigma. I haven&#39;t got time to
watch it, but I think it should be
fascinating. So, um,
am I really a alpha female?
All right.
Okay. All right. Any questions?
No questions.
No questions. No comments. Oh, here&#39;s a
question. Uh, it&#39;s forwarded by Chris
from Ravis Interest. In a democracy
opposition is understood but is but in
communist countries structure like China
should such developments be taken as
normal? No. I mean
in communist China opposition
could be deadly. Um even though in in in
in democratic countries they can be
deadly too. Um
so your question is
is should such developments be taken as
normal? You mean the developments that I
it&#39;s it&#39;s not normal
I think they try to save face so no
um I think the leader is so detached
from the reality the leader is so
detached from his uh deputies or
lieutenants or from from people under
him because everyone is afraid to speak
the truth. Everyone is afraid to tell
him what they really think. So the
leader the leader cannot make any
sensible decisions because he is being
fed with erroneous information
precisely because of um
the way the system is built. Right? So,
so there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s completely
there&#39;s a complete void of trust that
does not have any trust whatsoever.
So, it&#39;s going to crumble. Um yeah, if
speaking the truth is allowed to some
extent then I think the system still has
a mechanism a building mechanism to
correct itself but it doesn&#39;t
um it doesn&#39;t have that it doesn&#39;t allow
any true opinions um to to be to be sent
upward and so people are just telling
you what you want to hear and Um and so
that the leader loses
any uh any option or any doesn&#39;t have
any way to correct anything. Um it it&#39;s
not necessarily Xiinping&#39;s fault. It&#39;s
the fault of that system.
In a system, in a society where truth is
suppressed, where trust has collapsed,
the leader inevitably will will fall
will fall miserably because everyone is
lying to him and he&#39;s lying to everyone
too. So,
and for other people when they fall,
it&#39;s a minor fall. But when he is he is
the supreme leader when he&#39;s you know
woripped like a a semi- good he&#39;s going
to fall miserably he&#39;s when he falls
it&#39;s going to be very ugly. So I think
it&#39;s the system that&#39;s why it&#39;s
important that we we we tell the truth
and that&#39;s why trust is the most
important um quality in in governance in
in the political landscape. When you
don&#39;t trust when citizens do not trust
their politicians
then an effective government is gone.
There&#39;s no effective government and
that&#39;s happening all around the world
and not just in China. I mean China is
the extreme example.
China is I mean it the problem I
described exists in all other countries
in the United States as well. I mean
there&#39;s so many Americans who do not
trust their government and or their
officials or their um yeah politicians
but only in China
lies has been systematically
institutionalized
formalized it&#39;s like you have to lie or
you will fail.
So, China has gone to the far extreme of
being honest and or having transparency
in in the government. So, so China is
the far extreme. No, there&#39;s no country,
no society, no government
that ever exists in human civilization
that has gone that extreme. But CCP is
the one example. Um,
it&#39;s a great lesson to be learned.
okay. Uh,
all right. Um,
let&#39;s see. Somebody say, &#34;I wonder if
Xiinping will step down.&#34; U, people are
generally concerned about his health. I
really think he has some health problem.
Um there are people saying that the
person who went to Tibet was his bo body
double. Um someone asked me if it was
his body double because people generally
believe that he he is not in good
health. But when I studied the video
that I played you um on Thursday. I
think it&#39;s him. Very sad. I think he was
in poor health but he was forced to go.
But he went from
um sea level altitude to what three to
Lassa is on what 3500 meter altitude is
very high. So uh it it it must have
taken a toll on his health. Yeah.
So um people say that&#39;s why he left
early because his his health he can&#39;t he
can&#39;t stand being there. Uh so his
health is
the biggest risk at this moment.
Okay, here. Oh, super stickers are
coming in. Mike Stewart, I was late. I
will rewatch. Well, thank you. Well,
thank you. And another YouTube channel.
Thank you for the great live stream
tonight. Can&#39;t wait to watch the second
moon video tonight. Oh, yes.
Yeah, I was surprised that that video
didn&#39;t get many views. I thought that it
would it would go viral. I mean, the
first one did pretty well, but the
second one, I don&#39;t know why. Um, but it
to me, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the most
fascinating
story that I have ever heard. Um, it&#39;s
packed with so much information if you
really think about it.
but yeah so Chris if you can paste the
link here to help people if they haven&#39;t
haven&#39;t seen that video that would be
helpful to people can you paste the link
of the second moon video
all right
for global curious what with a decline
in Chinese economy do you think they can
continue supporting North Korea do you
think with the fall of CCP North Korea
might fall as
um with the fall of the CCP and it with
the fall of this CCP I think the next
person will react will be Russia&#39;s Putin
he he will definitely be affected and
with him changing position right realign
himself with the west I think that will
when Putin moves or jumps ship I mean
there&#39;s no ship I mean if the CCP falls
there&#39;s no ship
to jump. So when that happens, first it
will be Putin, then it will be North
Korea. I think it will definitely have
an impact on North Korea. Without the
CCP and Russia supporting the North
Korea, Kim Jong-
uh cannot sustain his his regime. His
regime cannot be continued the way it
is. So I think it will have an impact on
North Korea.
Someone asked me is there a chance not
to appear on the parade.
Uh I think the only
the only thing that would prevent him
from appearing is his health. Now he has
to appear even though he doesn&#39;t want
to. He has to appear because it&#39;s to
show unity. The party needs him because
he used the party unity to rally support
for his continued rule or continued
power. now he has to do it right. He
argued with his um with his opponents
that why he should continue running
China because of the party unity, right?
The the the regime&#39;s
safety, the regime&#39;s longevity.
So now he must deliver, you know, you
asked for it, you not you have to
deliver it now. So there&#39;s no way he
could skip that parade unless he is uh
frail. He&#39;s very sick. Um, that&#39;s the
only that&#39;s in my opinion that&#39;s the
only reason or excuse he could use to
skip the parade. Now he cannot no matter
how dangerous it is.
All right.
Okay. Um, oh, here&#39;s a question from
Aristi. Um, Chris forwarded from aris
arist arristi dis I don&#39;t know how to
pronounce his name. Can you elaborate on
the current foreign minister&#39;s wii&#39;s
relation to jang yosha.
I think Wangi is
some people say Wangi has a position in
the in the CCP because somebody say some
I mean there&#39;s a belief that he is the
legitimate son of former Premier Joe
Lai. They look alike.
Um so
uh so even if Xi I mean of course
Xiinping picked him and he has been
loyal to Xiinping. Even if Xiinping
falls down or falls from power I think
Wii will do okay uh because of his
connection to the former premiere. So
I think politicians like Wangi is just
trying to find a fine balance between
Xiinping and Jang Yosha. But because the
party because the party wants to uh
exhibit or display unity. So it&#39;s not
wrong of him to still pledge allegiance
to to Xiinping because he is still
officially the party leader. So we can&#39;t
tell, right? It&#39;s not wrong of him to to
repeat after Shiin Ping. So, but I think
I think he and Ja are okay. He does not
pose a threat to Jang Yosha. Janga does
not see him as a threat. So, I don&#39;t
think there&#39;s an issue between the two.
All right. Um, let&#39;s see.
All right, I think that&#39;s that&#39;s all.
Have I reached the bottom? I I have.
Okay, here&#39;s a question. Um,
oh yeah, Chris just copied the second
video about the moon.
I, like I said, it&#39;s Chris&#39;s best work.
You should give him support. Chris spent
a lot of time editing that video. Okay.
The Taiwan recall failed again. Seek the
truth. Yes. Uh I kind of saw that coming
because it was an uphill battle. It&#39;s
very difficult for them to win this this
these seven. Um what steps can now be
taken to keep the legislature from
taking over everything. I think they
just need to
um the movement like I I think need to
get into public awareness
um campaign. They need to raise
awareness of CCP&#39;s
playbook. uh they need to make sure the
public is aware of that and they should
stay away from
uh making it a political a politically
because they target all of KMT&#39;s um
legislators, right? So they they didn&#39;t
include any um uh DPP legislators in
this recall effort. So it does look
politically motivated to to the KMT uh
voters. I think they need to transition
themselves into a public awareness
um event. I mean movement.
Uh, I think they should have just I
mean, why do they target such a high
percentage of KMT legislators? It wasn&#39;t
it wasn&#39;t a smart move. They should have
just pinpoint a few notoriously pro-CCCP
legislators and have them removed and
then said, you know, use that as a stick
or or stick warning to other
uh KMT legislators. when you you when
you have such a massive
target when you target what like 40 40
to 50% of KMT legislators of course
they&#39;re going to you know get together
and defend themselves and so it&#39;s it&#39;s
not wise um but again it&#39;s a grassroot
movement so it it&#39;s not backed by DPP I
mean DPP should have get involved early
on give them some direction and tell
them this is not wise politically
because you cannot afford to fail. See
this kind of thing is you cannot afford
to fail. Um if you fail some and and win
some that that&#39;s okay. Um but then DPP
made a mistake of not getting involved
early on because they they want to they
want to say well we don&#39;t we don&#39;t want
to appear to to be involved in this
movement because we don&#39;t want to look
like we&#39;re politically motivated. But
that&#39;s wrong. Um, this is again like the
analogy I always use when see DPB try to
be a gentleman, right? They want to look
like they&#39;re gentlemen. They&#39;re not
playing dirty politics,
but the other side is playing dirty.
They&#39;re doing everything they can to
defend themselves, including having the
legislature giving out cash to voters.
So when a gentleman trying to look
unclean, this is not my initiative. This
is grassroot.
You know, they they want to save their
face by by claiming that they&#39;re
gentlemen and they lose. This is the
perfect example to show you when gent
when a gentleman fights with a hooligan,
the gentleman loses. Um, so that&#39;s the
lesson that DPP should should should
But it is Yeah. So they failed. They
failed again.
So, someone asked me, uh, there&#39;s a
would you say that the PL CCP just used
lies and trickeries to manipulate the
KMT to fight against Japan for them?
Yes, there&#39;s, um, there are more and
more historical um, evidence that have
shown up. Um, back in back in back in
the days, the CCP colluded with because
at the time when the Japanese government
was debating amongst themselves whether
to in invade China, there were two
One was against the war and one was in
favor. And the CCP backed the the
faction that&#39;s for war.
Um so the war broke out and then after
that um
you know the the Tiana the Shia incident
forces the the the nationalist
government to uh create a anti- uh
anti-Japanese alliance. So nominally the
CCP claimed that they fought with the
nationalist against Japan but they
didn&#39;t really fight at all. I mean it&#39;s
the nationalist army that fought but
because they are this um national
defense alliance they got the
intelligence from the nationalists and
they secretly gave provided the
intelligence the the secrets to the
Japanese you see how bad they are that&#39;s
that&#39;s what CCP CCP has been bad from
day one they just didn&#39;t turn bad uh
when Xiinping came over they were bad
from day one So they encouraged the
Japanese politicians to start the war
and then they accused the nationalist
government for not fighting the Japanese
for not including them in the effort
to defend China. So the nationalists
were were were forced to include the CCP
in their alliance. Once they&#39;re in the
alliance, they got the se the uh the
battlefield secrets. They fed that to
the Japanese,
okay? And it caused large casualties on
the national. So the nationalists fought
a bloody war. They lost so many generals
and soldiers. During that time, the CCP
grew, they grew their armies. How did
they do that? By um selling uh narcotics
like opium. They grew opium and
narcotics in their base and sold it to
the nationalist occupied regions to make
money. They did everything they they
could to harm the Chinese. And so that
after the the the the nationalist army
won the war, the CCP was already strong
enough. They started the civil war and
then the nationalist and then if the
United States governments were
supportive of the nationalists then
there&#39;s no way the CCP could win. But
unfortunately we didn&#39;t. We we&#39;ve
somehow the American government naively
believed that the CCP was a second
political party that would just um that
you know their existence will make China
more de democratic.
uh they believe in having a two-party
system. They didn&#39;t understand the
nature of the communists. So then the
CCP won the war. There was such an
underdog. There&#39;s no way that they would
they would have won the war. So it was
not by military strength. It was not by
their weapons. It was not by their
financial means. It was purely through
deceit, lies, and manipulation. So if
the world is still not facing not
recognizing this threat, you know, if
the United States is still complacent
thinking that we have better weapons,
you know, our armies are more
experienced,
the CCP never won because they had more
money, they had better weapons or they
had better trained soldiers. They ne
they they didn&#39;t win based on those.
Um, so I think that was a lesson
learned. So to answer your question,
yes, the CCP colluded with the Japanese
and Mao openly thanked Japanese
delegations,
um, as well as military leaders who
visited China in the 1950s and60s. He
personally thanked them for giving him a
chance to rise to power. If the Japanese
didn&#39;t invade China, there&#39;s no way CCP
would be, you know, in existence today
in China.
Anyways, that&#39;s my answer. So, study
history and I think we need to study
history, these historical lessons really
hard and asking ourselves, are we making
the same mistake again? Now I think to
some extent we are because the west the
western society to be honest with you is
too comfortable with their wealth with
their dominance in the world. You know
we have grown too comfortable with what
we have with what we have achieved. Our
people are too complacent and to some
extent too lazy to understand the threat
and uh and the CCP is fully aware of
They have studied us more than we have
studied them.
all right.
Okay. I think Oh, here&#39;s a just a small
thank you for for Lelay and Chris at
all. There&#39;s no at all. It&#39;s just Lelay
and Chris.
Thank you in another YouTube channel.
All right. Oh, Brian Cowell. Thank you,
All right. Uh, I want to thank everyone
without name. Well, thank you, Phantom
without name.
Uh, okay. Excellent. That&#39;s all for
tonight. I think I should end it here.
Thank you very much and I&#39;ll see you
next week. Enjoy the rest of your
weekend. Bye.
