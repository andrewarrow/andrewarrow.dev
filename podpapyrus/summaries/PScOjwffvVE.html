Hi, I&#39;m Lauren. And I&#39;m Matt. And this
is Publish and Prosper, where
publishing, e-commerce, and marketing
collide. Hey everyone, welcome back to
another episode of Publish and Prosper.
Uh, today&#39;s going to be a fun one
because I am sitting next to someone
that isn&#39;t Matt. Oh, you ruined my
intro. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m Matt.
You could imitate him as much as you
want. Well, I can&#39;t because you don&#39;t
curse on this podcast. That&#39;s That&#39;s
true. Also, I imagine that would be a
hard voice to maintain for the entire
episode. I wouldn&#39;t be able to talk for
the rest of the week. I think about that
all the time. Um, one of the actors from
the show Supernatural talked about how
he like gave his character an an
unnaturally deep voice when he first
started playing him and then like 10
years later when he was still on the
show was like, I really regret that that
acting decision.
Um, yeah, I&#39;ll maintain a pretty regular
voice. I&#39;ll try. This is my normal
speaking voice. So, perfect. Not acting.
You&#39;re doing You&#39;re doing great. Uh, for
those of you that are not watching this
episode and you&#39;re wondering who that
is, this is Chelsea Bennett. I am. This
is our engagement and community manager
here at Lulu. Yes. And she will be
joining me on the podcast today. Yes.
Thank you so much for having me. I can&#39;t
believe I got the invite to the podcast.
I feel like I&#39;m really moving up in
life. It&#39;s a pretty exclusive invite.
Honestly, it is. Only two people can be
in this room at a time. Yeah. We had to
kick Matt out for me to be in here.
Good. Well, we tried to record it with
three people one time and it it was a
struggle. So, I saw I saw Sarah Gilbert
just looked like she was your overlord
sitting really high above you. So, yeah,
this is a good setup, I think. Yeah. So,
we thought we would try something new
today and do it with the two of us. If
you are watching on YouTube or if you&#39;re
listening to this and you&#39;re going, &#34;Hm,
that voice sounds familiar.&#34; You&#39;ve
you&#39;ve probably seen and heard Chelsea
before. She is our primary YouTube
personality. Yes. like and subscribe if
you&#39;re not already. Yeah, please do. Um
and also has hosted many of our
webinars. Yes. And many of our virtual
events and and appearances and stuff
like that. Yes. So, do you want to tell
us a little bit more about like what you
do here? Yeah. Um yeah, I&#39;ve been at
Lulu actually. I was saying this the
other day that I just celebrated my 8th
year anniversary at Lulu. Very exciting.
Yes. Um so I have been fortunate to be
able to get out in front of people and
do speaking engagements, webinars, go to
conferences, um virtual events and our
YouTube channel. Um which has been very
exciting. So um if you are in need of
any information or content about
publishing, that&#39;s usually what we talk
about. That&#39;s actually all I talk about.
I don&#39;t have a co-host on the Lulule
videos, so I don&#39;t get unhinged. Uh
unfortunately, I feel like you guys have
a lot more fun. But um yeah, check it
out. Actually, that&#39;s a great first
question for me. What do you think the
difference is on that? Like having
because you know, I&#39;ve thought about
that before where it&#39;s just you on your
own recording those versus me and Matt
in here together. Like, do you think
that&#39;s one is easier than the other or
do you think there are pros and cons to
both? There have to be pros and cons to
both. I think it&#39;s probably easier Well,
I mean, it just depends on your
personality. I think for me I think it&#39;s
easier to just be by myself but then you
don&#39;t have someone being like hey what
are you talking about like there&#39;s no
one well I will say um you know to lift
the veil a little bit my husband is a
videographer so he films our Lulu videos
um and then we have Ashley who&#39;s amazing
who&#39;s on the Lulu team who edits them um
but you know he will humble me every now
and again and be like what are you doing
you&#39;re going off on a tangent what you
said doesn&#39;t make sense so that&#39;s good
um but I think it&#39;s nice to have you a
co-host and some banter every now and
again. So, it can go either or. Yeah, I
think that&#39;s fair. Yeah. So, I guess
that&#39;s right off the bat anyone
listening to this who is thinking about
doing any kind of uh video content or
using video as a marketing tool or a
brand growth tool. If you&#39;re
debating having a co-host with you or
doing it by yourself, pros and cons to
both. Yeah. Personally, as somebody
sitting in the co-host seat, I would
recommend doing it alone. Just kidding,
Matt. Miss you. Wish you were here.
Yeah. Miss you, Matt. You&#39;re the best.
He&#39;s going to listen to this and be
like, &#34;You&#39;re both fired. Get out of
here.&#34; Oh gosh. We better make this
really worth it then. It&#39;s going to It&#39;s
going to be worth it. If it&#39;s going to
be the last episode, it&#39;s going to be
the best episode. Click the link in the
description below for my GoFundMe.
Yeah. Help us. It&#39;s going to be great.
Um, but yeah, so we thought we would
talk to you all today about video
content and kind of a lot of the
different things that go with it. Um,
also just kind of going to put a
disclaimer up at the top that when we&#39;re
talking about video content in this
particular episode, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
really talking about things like Tik
Toks or Instagram reels or that like
short form social media video content.
Yeah, I don&#39;t do a lot of that. I mean,
sometimes the content that we make for
our YouTube channel gets chopped up for
things like that. And we do shorts,
which has been interesting to play
around with, but for I mean, my
experience is really more in the longer
form content creating that for Lulu.
Yeah. Yeah. So, that&#39;s definitely what
we&#39;re going to focus more on today. That
idea of And you&#39;ve done I was actually I
was thinking about this yesterday while
I was writing out my list of questions.
The amount of different types of long-
form video content that you&#39;ve created
for Lulu Yeah. is substantial. eight
years worth. Eight years worth. But also
just like kind of running the gamut of
YouTube videos. If you haven&#39;t watched
any of our Lulu videos, highly
recommend. They&#39;re highly recommend.
Please plug yourself. Go ahead. Could
not recommend more highly for you to
watch these videos. Yeah, they are
great. But they are like I love them.
They make me laugh out loud all the time
and they&#39;re educational. So that&#39;s fun.
Edutainment. I try to be in that lane. I
think you think you nail it. But there&#39;s
also then you do also a lot of our
tutorial videos. Mhm. Um which is a
different definitely a different kind of
video style and approach than the Lulu
use. Yeah. You&#39;ve also done webinars. I
have. And you&#39;ve done we said virtual
events which are like live events and
stuff like that and the the online
course that we did. I did do that. I&#39;ve
also interviewed Bob Young twice. Wow. I
I know. I know. So, I mean, I know that
I don&#39;t know how much time you have to
go through all my accolades, but I mean,
I as much as you want. Yeah, we&#39;ve done
we&#39;ve done a lot of content and you
know, for anyone um that is thinking
about trying to introduce video content
into their repertoire or as a lead genen
or brand building tool. Um, you know,
there&#39;s a lot that you can play around
with. There&#39;s so many formats and it
really depends on your content and then,
you know, what your audience is coming
to you for. So, I mean, as you said,
tutorials, those are great. Um, and
maybe playing around with the length of
of videos, webinars obviously longer.
This podcast of course is longer. Um,
and then sometimes depending, you know,
on the content, if it&#39;s just how to
publish a book, you want to get in and
out with that. So, you try to make those
a little bit quicker. But there&#39;s so
much that you can play around with. I
mean, the tone, the delivery, the
graphics, if you want to have those. I
mean, for a long time, our videos were
just me staring into a camera with a
gray screen behind me and just talking
about, you know, bookish things. Um, and
recently, more recently, I&#39;ve been like,
this is not, as much as I love myself, I
have, you know, my self-esteem is pretty
solid, but I&#39;m like, we got to we got to
cut this out. There has to be something
more visually engaging um than than me
talking. So, yeah, there&#39;s just a lot of
room to play around with it and a lot of
room for creativity if you want to
explore it. How did you actually make
that decision? Because I I did notice
recently that we&#39;ve kind of shifted what
the Lulu videos look like right now. Um,
and there&#39;s a lot I mean pretty
dramatically from what they used to be.
And part of that has been an evolution
over time, but definitely like if you
looked at a video from seven years ago
and then you looked at the most recent
one, you notice I&#39;ve only gotten older.
Yeah. You haven&#39;t aged a day. I don&#39;t
know what you&#39;re talking about. Bless
you. Bless you. What kind of like how do
you decide that? Like what what did you
like research better practices for
YouTube or was it something you were
experimenting with? Like what kind of
led to that decision to change it up a
little bit? Well, as you said, you know,
or maybe I said this, but I&#39;ve been
doing this for a long time. You know,
I&#39;ve been making these videos for a long
time, and so, you know, I just I I
thought it was kind of getting boring.
Our editor, Ashley, who is so amazing
and so talented. I think she maybe has
the hardest job at Lulu because she has
watched so many hours of me fumbling
through scripts and trying to figure out
the right words to say and then, you
know, cursing if I can&#39;t get it right.
So, um, you know, I I just wanted it to
be more interesting and and also, you
know, I thought it may be more
interesting for her as well to just try
a different format and try something
else. And then, you know, to your point
about best practices when you look at I
looked at creators on YouTube who were
making educational content or, you know,
as I said like edutainment um, and they
are doing a lot of B-roll, a lot of
cutaways, you know, we try we
experimented with like inserting memes
and gifts. Sometimes that lands,
sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Um, so it just
kind of, you know, as you evolve and you
grow and you&#39;re making content, you want
to continue giving your audience what
they&#39;re looking for, but also trying to
reach a wider audience and just continue
evolving how polished the content is,
how professional it looks. So, it&#39;s
really just trying to to continue doing
better than we have in the past. So,
that was kind of what was behind that.
And also, I&#39;m just like, how many more
years can I stare into a camera and talk
with people wanting to watch this? we&#39;ve
got to, you know, hopefully make it a
bit more engaging and and interesting
for the audience. So, that&#39;s where it
came from. Well, I think so far it&#39;s
working. Well, thank you. You&#39;re
welcome. I I definitely laughed out loud
again at a few of the the most recent
videos. Excellent. So, you&#39;re nailing
it. Um maybe we should back up a little
bit though. Let&#39;s define, I guess, the
point of all of this. Yeah. Of video
content. a video content of like you
know we&#39;re kind of making the argument I
think that video content long form video
content like we&#39;re talking about not Tik
Toks reals whatever is something that
can be a value ad yes yes to
authors or content entrepreneurs
obviously we&#39;re not talking to people
who are already video content creators
make more video content right double
down you all know what you&#39;re doing
already but but to people that are
looking for ways to grow their brand and
grow their readership and grow their
audience and are considering maybe
adding a video element to it. Like I
think that&#39;s who we&#39;re talking to. I
think so. Drop a comment if that&#39;s you.
Yeah, please do. But um like what do you
think like what do you think is the
value ad of adding some kind of video
element to your marketing strategy?
Well, I think for most and again it is
really dependent on the content. Like if
you&#39;re making if your content is very
technical, then I would say video is a
tool to help your audience get through
your content or your framework or your
process easier and they just have visual
cues for how to do it. But if you are an
author or a content creator um who isn&#39;t
doing something super technical, I think
it really just humanizes your brand. It
allows people to connect with you on a
more authentic level. Um, and so I think
that that&#39;s really the value ad is more
and more with the world that we live in
with the AI and automation and all of
these things, I think people are really
hungry for a authenticity. And so being
able to come on video and it doesn&#39;t
have to be super highly polished or
produced, but being able to put up a
video and just tell people about your
process or um or why you&#39;re doing things
or kind of share your why. We we&#39;ve done
a lot of research at Lulu to understand
that people really connect with these
things. And so I think it really just
gives you um a more of a connection to
your audience and lets them understand
who the person is behind the brand and
your motivations for doing it and helps
them align with you a bit more and then
connect with you. There&#39;s also the
engagement piece of it um where you can
have a conversation with your audience.
And so I think that those are the most
powerful ways that you can use video to
really um kind of grow your brand and
and enhance your presence online. I
would say yeah I think that&#39;s fair. I
mean we see it all the time. I I can&#39;t
tell you the number of times that I&#39;ve
been at an event and somebody has come
up to the booth at least once. Every
event that I&#39;ve been at that somebody
has come up and been like, &#34;Is Chelsea
here or like where&#39;s the girl who&#39;s on
your YouTube channel? Like, isn&#39;t she
like, is she here?&#34; Like, you know, you
you have absolutely become like as I
don&#39;t want to say a brand ambassador,
but kind I would be proud to ambassul.
Perfect. I can&#39;t wait to use that sound
bite for this episode. Thank you so
much. Yeah, I you know I mean yeah it&#39;s
but also you know I for anyone you know
we were talking about this before um we
kind of hopped on but video is um you
can do a faceless channel. We&#39;re kind of
talking about that because there is a
level of um you know just putting
yourself out there with anything. And I
mean that&#39;s it&#39;s the same for like you
know if you put a I was going to say a
tweet or an X. I heard someone call it
an excrement. like that&#39;s instead of
calling it a tweet. So if you put out an
extra perfect, but anything you put out
online, there is that level of you&#39;re
putting yourself out there in front of a
the world essentially. And so video
content, if you are someone who it is um
you can&#39;t get out of bed with the
thought that you&#39;re going to do that,
then maybe it&#39;s not for you. Or maybe
you do a faceless channel. There are so
many channels that are really popular
that you never see the creator&#39;s face.
Maybe you just hear their voice. Um, but
you know, creating video content, there
is that level of you&#39;re putting yourself
out there, um, and kind of seeing if it
works. And I think more and more people
are, you know, it&#39;s not weird anymore to
say, I have a YouTube channel or I&#39;m
doing this. And I think if you are
thinking about trying video content, and
it doesn&#39;t have to be on YouTube, but
just kind of letting yourself giving
yourself permission to say, I&#39;m going to
try this, and if it works, great, and if
it doesn&#39;t, then I&#39;ll move on. um and
not thinking the metrics that you see
from a video are in any way tied to your
self-worth. It&#39;s an important thing to
differentiate that if you are going to
make video content, I will say. Yeah, I
I think that&#39;s very reasonable and like
more so I think with video content like
that than with some of the other kinds
of social media content that we see
because there is definitely like
something a little bit personal and
vulnerable about putting your face out
there. Oh yeah, for sure. But yeah, I
mean I I actually never really thought
about that, but like one of my favorite
YouTube channels is a Faceless channel
and like a very popular channel that has
like fantastic metrics and is at least
10 to 15 years old and I don&#39;t think
he&#39;s ever shown his face. Right. Right.
And like it&#39;s so it&#39;s totally doable.
That&#39;s that&#39;s a great point. But what
would you say? Like do you have any
advice for people that
um are are okay with that idea in
theory, but they&#39;re just a little bit
nervous about like getting on camera?
Were you ever nervous about getting on
camera or were you right away like, &#34;No,
I got this. It&#39;s fine.&#34; Yeah, I mean, I
will say for whatever reason it doesn&#39;t
um Yeah, I was kind of fine with it, but
but it&#39;s because I&#39;m just looking into a
camera and just talking and there&#39;s no
the audience isn&#39;t immediately there.
So, it was very easy for me to do, but I
also, you know, understand that it is
really intimidating to stare into a
camera, especially if you get wrapped up
in the fact that, well, I&#39;m going to go
live and then anyone can see this and,
you know, share their thoughts about
what you&#39;re doing. But I think, you
know, I guess my advice would be a, you
know, give yourself permission to do it.
And, and I think for me, it&#39;s helpful to
just say this is just an experiment. I&#39;m
just trying it. It&#39;s okay to, you know,
try something else. And then give
yourself grace. Like, don&#39;t be your
biggest critic. You will have people
online who will do that for you. You
don&#39;t need to hop on the bandwagon. But
just know it&#39;s okay to try things and
you know know that you&#39;re going to mess
up. There are going to be people. It
doesn&#39;t matter if you do everything
right. If you nail every line, if you go
first try and warm up, don&#39;t have to do
any retakes. Someone is going to come in
your comments at some point and be like,
&#34;That&#39;s a dumb shirt.&#34; Or like whatever.
And you know, but you can&#39;t worry about
those things. And I still, you know,
that&#39;s something I struggle with cuz
people, you know, if I get on and look
at our YouTube comments and someone has
says something disparaging about me, it
does kind of take you out of it. You&#39;re
like, gosh, you know, this is, you know,
and you have these thoughts of like,
what does this mean and am I not doing
great and I suck and all that. So, yeah,
you can&#39;t do that. I mean, it&#39;s much
easier said than done, but you have to
kind of be able to step away from it and
realize like this is content I&#39;m putting
out there, but it doesn&#39;t, you know, it
doesn&#39;t make me it doesn&#39;t affect my
value if people don&#39;t like it. You know
what I mean? And also, if you are
genuinely trying to serve your audience
and really trying to offer valuable
content, the people that need to find it
are going to find it and they&#39;re going
to appreciate it. So, um, if you are
intimidated by it, then really just
think, is this going to be valuable for
you or is it going to cause you anxiety
and make you have ulcers because you
can&#39;t even fathom, you know, putting
yourself out there like that. Um, but I
would just say, you know, you can try
it. The internet does live forever, but
it also moves really quickly, so you can
delete it and move on. That&#39;s so true.
And I have definitely like I I&#39;ve
because I&#39;ve seen a lot of the comments
on our YouTube channel and so many times
had the thought of like, god, Chelsea&#39;s
got thick skin to be able to do this.
Like that takes a lot of metal to be
able to ignore this. So kudos to you for
that. Well, that is one thing that I was
going to say is if you do want to do it,
just go ahead and have a mental process
in place to be able to take in this and
then move away from it. Like I think
that I&#39;ve worked on that and you know
just being able to realize that like
every you know these keyboard
warriors that want to hop on. They&#39;re
not doing the thing. You&#39;re doing the
thing. So at the end of the day even if
you tried to do a run of videos you
thought this is not for me and moved on
and you got hate comments whatever that
person&#39;s not doing it. You&#39;re actually
doing the work and you&#39;ve learned from
that and you&#39;re growing from it. Um and
you know I think you&#39;ll get more
comfortable. And I also think, you know,
as I said, you are your biggest critic.
And it&#39;s so easy when I watch some of my
older videos. I mean, there&#39;s some where
I thought my hair looked bad. I was
sweating. I look, you know, whatever. I
mean, you thin, fat, tan, not tan, you
know, it was stupid, whatever. So,
you&#39;re your biggest critic and just know
that people don&#39;t care. They&#39;re not
worried about that. They&#39;re there for
the information. And again, if you can
serve your audience and add value, then
that&#39;s going to rise to the top and
you&#39;re going to connect with the people
you need to. I think I think that&#39;s
that&#39;s such a valuable thing to keep in
mind in in so many different
circumstances. I mean, I was telling
somebody recently that for this podcast,
I have made an active intentional effort
to not wear the same shirt twice in
videos. I gave up on that so many times.
Well, and that&#39;s what like the person
that I said that to was like, why do you
think anybody other than you is going to
notice? And I was like, well, that&#39;s a
really good point actually. I know. I do
the same thing. And like I was thinking
about that cuz I filmed, you know, Lulu
on Friday and I&#39;m like going through my
closet and I&#39;m like, &#34;Well, what have I
worn before? What haven&#39;t I worn?&#34; And
I&#39;m like, &#34;Hey, no, I mean listen, I
know that people love, you know, I hope
love the channel and they they&#39;re
watching them, but I don&#39;t have any
stands are going to be like, why are you
wearing that plaid shirt twice? Change
clothes.&#34; You know what I mean? Can you
believe she repeated the shirt that she
wore three years ago?
I know. I was pretty bummed that you
guys don&#39;t have hair and makeup and
wardrobe. I came thinking that that was
going to work out. You guys, we got to
talk. Next time I interview Bob, that&#39;ll
be one of the questions. What is the
wardrobe and makeup budget? Oh. Oh, what
beautiful scenery. And now we&#39;re in the
woods. Lovely. Just a little J that
that&#39;s our hair and makeup right there.
Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly. The little
scenery shift. Um, yeah. Surprise.
That&#39;s That&#39;s a computer screen that we
have to keep. I just broke the fourth
wall. Sorry. It&#39;s terrible. This is a
real how the sausage gets made behind
the scenes for sure. Um, but yeah, I I
mean I do think that&#39;s really just
something that is really valuable to
remember for people when considering the
idea of creating video content or
creating any kind of I mean any content
that you&#39;re putting out there, even
publishing books like Oh my gosh. It&#39;s
impossible to publish a book with or to
write a book without putting a little
piece of yourself into it. Oh yeah. Oh
yeah. Fiction or non-fiction. Yeah,
which actually I guess that&#39;s usually
something that we try to do on this
podcast is talk about books.
Occasionally, very rarely, but you know,
occasionally um is try to make it clear
whether or not we&#39;re talking to
non-fiction authors, fiction authors, or
we think that something is applicable to
both. Yeah. Do you think that there&#39;s
value? I mean, we&#39;re we&#39;ve talked about
your experience creating edutainment
content, which obviously kind of
naturally lends itself to uh non-fiction
Yes. author, but do you think that there
is value for fiction authors in creating
video content as well? Yeah, I think so.
I mean, I think it goes back to that
just really being more um personable and
humanizing yourself to your audience.
You know, we talk about this a lot at
Lulu, but fiction, the fandom around
fiction is um so ravenous. And so, you
know, people want to know who the author
is. They want to know more about you.
And so, I think also, you know, for
fiction, it lends itself to video, but
also um maybe more casual videos. So,
it&#39;s like, you know, for some videos it
makes sense to get lighting and get the
camera and get the setup and really go
the extra mile to make sure it looks
really professional and polished because
you are trying to present yourself as um
as an authority like you know that
that&#39;s to your point about why we edited
them differently for the last round. And
I was like, I need a desk. You know,
it&#39;s like I can&#39;t I can&#39;t just sit here
on a chair anymore. Like, you know, I
have to have a desk. That&#39;s what all
these people, you look like, you know,
oh, I just happen to be working on
something really noble and now there&#39;s a
camera in my face and I&#39;ll talk to you.
So, I was like, that&#39;s, you know, I felt
maybe a good evolution for our channel.
But for fiction content, you know, it
could be much more approachable like
getting your phone out and just saying,
hey, I&#39;m writing my pages today and
here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing or here&#39;s where I
like to write or getting ready for this
event. um or you know I&#39;m about to go
live with my community and also just the
uh the channel to ask questions and get
feedback and you know for better or
worse the time that we live in it&#39;s so
easy to get in that feedback loop and
and really hear from your audience and I
think that can be really valuable for
fiction and non-fiction but if you&#39;re a
fiction author and you&#39;re turnurning out
books like we see that some are then you
can instantaneously put up a video and
say hey I&#39;m working on this what do you
think here are my covers
um here&#39;s what this character is doing,
here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking, and really get
that buy in and kind of build that
fandom around your brand. Yeah, totally.
I think there&#39;s a place for it. Do you
do you concur? I absolutely do. Yeah,
that was fully a leading question to be
like, yes, I do think this is real
fiction. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we&#39;re often
in here a lot of the times we fall into
this spectrum of I am much more
interested in fiction and tend to lean
like my conversation tends to leans
tends to lean more towards talking to
fiction authors and Matt tends to be the
the non-fiction author advocate. So, I&#39;m
always in here being like, &#34;Hey, this is
relevant to fiction authors.&#34; Yeah. I
mean I do think but it&#39;s also so based
on personality too because you know to
be a writer it can be so um you know
individual and very isolating at times.
Um so and a lot of people you know
that&#39;s why we have so many questions
about the marketing piece of it and so
for some people when you think of
marketing as a challenge then putting
yourself out there and making a video is
just like almost too much. So, I think
it really just depends on personality as
well. But absolutely, you know, I think
fiction authors can do really, really
well um with video and we&#39;ve seen that.
Uh and then, you know, non-fiction of
course as well because you can, you
know, really expand on your content and
what you&#39;re trying to teach your
audience. Yeah, absolutely. Um, I want
to go back to something that you said in
there because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of been
focusing more on like scripted edited
pre-recorded video content and like
YouTube videos and stuff like that, but
you also have a lot of experience with
live video. So whether that looks like a
webinar or some kind of event or virtual
I mean we see we&#39;ve seen all kinds of
different like virtual book and
publishing events. Um, and even like you
said going live in a community. So, just
something like an informal like going
live in some way. Uh, how do you like do
you think that that&#39;s or I mean
obviously that&#39;s different from
obviously that&#39;s different than than
pre-recorded video. Um, how do you see
that differently? Like do you approach
that differently? And do you think it
has different value? I can we can do
those one at a time. H how do you
approach that differently? Do you
approach that differently? Live video
versus recorded video. Yeah. Well, for
live videos, you know, usually I&#39;m kind
of working through a slide deck and kind
of going through it. Um, but for live
videos, I mean, to be very honest,
whenever I do a live session, whether
it&#39;s a webinar or a presentation, I
always just try to set an intention
before I do it of being helpful and of
really trying to add value to the
audience. And I think it really goes
back to that, you know, because I was
reading something that&#39;s like it&#39;s only,
you know, it&#39;s basically 80% like your
tone and the way you deliver things, but
like 20% people are actually listening
to what you&#39;re saying. So you can, you
know, fumble words around, but really
again, if you&#39;re um delivering it, I I
think authentically and you&#39;re um you
care and you&#39;re really trying to get it
across, then I think the audience gives
you a lot of grace, especially in a live
uh situation. So, but I always try to
approach, you know, anytime I&#39;m
presenting or trying to teach anything
is like, you know, how can I help and
can I offer this in a way that is going
to be valuable and approachable? And I
think that that is important um if you
can do that. And sometimes, you know, if
you&#39;re frantic about it, then that&#39;s not
super helpful. But I do try to do that.
But when I&#39;m ever doing live
presentations, then I have an outline, I
have a slide deck that I&#39;m going
through. Um, I also try to start by just
kind of getting a little icebreaker, you
know, um, just asking people where
they&#39;re from or have you published
before or whatever your content is. Um,
one really fun one that I did for a
romance conference was like your um, the
street you grew up on plus the last
thing you ate is your um, erotica author
name and then people Yeah. What would
yours What would yours be? Let&#39;s see.
The thing that you ate last and then the
street that you grew up on.
What did I eat last?
Don&#39;t try to church it up now. No. No.
No. No. I&#39;m try I&#39;m genuinely trying to
remember. Duros.
It was toast. Toast. Toast. Peach tree.
Toast. Peach tree. That&#39;s pretty good.
Toast. Toast. Peach tree. Toast. Toast
is a very appropriate name for that
because that&#39;s pretty much all I eat is
bread. I like that. So, yeah. So just
doing something fun like that or like I
like to see if there&#39;s like a fun fact
for the day or like a national holiday
that&#39;s silly or whatever. So just trying
to you know invite some conversation. Um
and then you know getting into it and
then leaving as much time for questions
at the end because the value of a live
session is that you&#39;re there to answer
questions. And with publishing my
favorite term is you don&#39;t know what you
don&#39;t know. Because whenever I started
working at Lulu I&#39;m like oh
self-publishing you do it all by
yourself. How great. This is so
approachable. But now that I&#39;ve been
here for a while, I realize it&#39;s not a
it&#39;s not a like individual sport. Like
it should be if you want to do it well,
it should be done with a team of people.
And that team can be one other person.
It could be, you know, whatever your
budget allows. Um, but so when you are
doing a live session, just kind of keep
that in mind that really people are
going to want to be able to talk to you
about their specific situations. And so
being able to offer that I think is the
biggest value of doing a live video. I
think that&#39;s we that&#39;s something that we
talk about a lot on air and off there is
is that value of having that open line
of communication with your customers and
with your readers and with your audience
and how that really I mean we&#39;ve talked
about that in terms of like this is how
you turn casual fans into like true
loyal fans. This is how you connect with
new audiences because you know they
remember you. I mean, I I remember the
people that that like I had felt a
connection with when I when they were
like speakers at sessions that were
relatable and authentic and engaging and
then like took questions or I spoke to
them afterwards. Like those are the ones
that stick in my memory way more than
the ones that just lectured at me for
five minutes. Right. Right. Just
bloating and you&#39;re just like listening
to the sound of your own voice, which
can happen. I mean, you know, hey, bless
him. whatever words. I mean, I host a
Not you. Certainly not you. No,
I love the sound of my own voice. If
you&#39;re listening to this podcast and you
haven&#39;t picked up on that fact yet, I
don&#39;t know what to do. Like if you love
Lauren&#39;s voice.
Perfect. Great. Like and subscribe. Like
and subscribe. All it. Yeah. Yeah. But
yeah, I think that that&#39;s I mean we this
is just another form of something that
we talk about all the time where it is
it is something that this is another way
for you to forge authentic connections
with your audience and also hopefully to
get yourself in front of a new audience.
Yeah, we&#39;ve talked about the value of
public speaking. Um we&#39;ve talked about I
one of the reference or one of the oh my
god words. One of the one of the things
that I have referenced possibly more
than any other piece of content that
we&#39;ve created on this podcast
is the webinar that you did with
Stephanie Chandler. Like Stephanie,
shout out to Stephanie Chandler, NFAA uh
founder. If you are a non-fiction
author, go check them out. It&#39;s a
wonderful community. Yeah, definitely
do. Highly recommend. But I plug the
webinar that she did with you a couple
years ago on public speaking. Oh yeah.
Yeah, she talked about how to use your
book as like a entryway into public
speaking and or user public speaking as
an entryway into like selling your book.
I think I reference that at least once
every month on this podcast. Like it is
such a phenomenal webinar. But even just
that, even talking about that right now
and talking about how often I reference
that, like that is a prime example of
somebody creating an opportunity for
themselves. That was a Lulu hosted
webinar that wasn&#39;t I mean Stephanie
has her own community where she hosts
her own content but that was something
that she was a guest on one of our
and even years later now that is still
theoretically adding value to her brand
because even if one person every time
that I reference it clicks on that link
to go check it out. Right, that&#39;s one
new person in her audience that wasn&#39;t
there before. Well, right. And much like
you know we say about books and like
growing your audience like you know
while you sleep the content that we&#39;re
making will this will go on even you
know we&#39;re making money for Lulu as we
sleep hopefully. You know what I mean? I
know. Yeah. But you know it&#39;s true that
when you put this content out there then
it can live forever. And then you know I
you know when we say like and subscribe
like and subscribe but these metrics
that you look at you know even if you
don&#39;t see and I mean it&#39;ll you know the
metrics that you think important can or
are important can change um but you have
to remember the shelf life of videos you
know if it&#39;s good can it can be up
forever and I mean some of our best
performing videos are some of the first
ones that we did just about um
formatting. I mean that&#39;s such a
struggle for people especially again if
you are trying to go more of a DIY
route. Um but just the basics metadata.
Um you did a great short for us about
five indicators your book is
self-published. So these things that you
do that can kind of live forever and
then are great reference points and then
you don&#39;t have to keep regurgitating the
same thing or keep telling someone how
to use your book as a way to get into
speaking or how to speak to get book
sales or whatever. you can just point
them to this podcast or this long form
uh video that you&#39;ve done and hopefully
they&#39;ll be able to engage with it, watch
it at their own pace and self-study uh
and be able to get what they need from
it that way. I have watched I personally
have watched that fun with formatting
webinar at least 10 times. I know
formatting is so every time that I have
tried to create a book on Lulu, I&#39;ve
watched it and I literally I will sit
there and I will play this the part that
I need and then pause it and do whatever
was done in you. It&#39;s you that&#39;s
boosting the views. It&#39;s me. But
absolutely that is and that that content
is I think we filmed that like that was
maybe 2018 I feel like or I was here for
it. So it was I think 2019 but it was
like within the first six months that I
started here. Yeah. So that that video
is at least six years old. Yeah. You
know that&#39;s I need to watch that video
because the first book that I tried to
publish at Lulu, it ended up with no
page numbers because I couldn&#39;t even
figure out how to how to do that. So
yeah, shout out if you need help with
formatting that webinar is is a great
one. But I mean these things that you
you know I know that we make good
content and we definitely try really
hard to make it high quality. Um but you
know sometimes you just don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going to resonate and what&#39;s
going to you know stick with your
audience. And you know, that&#39;s something
that um I would also say for anyone
who&#39;s trying or interested in trying
videos, you can&#39;t be precious about it.
You have to I mean, we were talking
about having a thick skin, but there are
some things that I just thought were so
funny and like these intros. And also,
you know, so the new videos that we&#39;re
doing now or the videos that we&#39;re doing
now, I&#39;m not like trying to play around
with a cute intro anymore. I&#39;m like,
&#34;Hey, welcome to the channel. Let&#39;s get
into it.&#34; You know, because the
retention rates, you know, it&#39;s hard to
get people&#39;s um you know, get people&#39;s
advice or not advice. Well, if you have
advice, drop it in the comments, but
it&#39;s hard to get their attention and
keep it. Um, so yeah, being able to
really get into something and dive in
and then, you know, looking at what
people are watching and what they&#39;re
resonating and then being able to do
more of that. Um, and you know, being
able to kind of, you know, not get your
ego too involved and say, you know, just
because they didn&#39;t think it was
hilarious doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m a bad
person. It could just keep going. You
know what? Also, it doesn&#39;t mean it
wasn&#39;t funny, right? Yeah. It doesn&#39;t
mean I&#39;m not hilarious either, but yeah.
Um, so being able to kind of cater to
the audience once you start to see
things take off and not being a afraid
to do more of what they like and you
know maybe go against some of your your
initial instincts there. What do you
look at? Not to get too like in the
weeds about this, but what what metrics
or what kind of like hallmarks are you
looking for when you&#39;re looking back at
a video performance to kind of see like,
okay, I was trying something new in this
episode or in this video. Let&#39;s see if
it worked. Let&#39;s see if it didn&#39;t. Like,
what what are the indicators that you&#39;re
looking for to tell you whether or not
you should continue doing something that
you did in a recent video or shift my
Um, yeah. Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s changed. It&#39;s
changed because at the beginning, I was
just like, subscribers, we got to get
the subscribers. That&#39;s the most
important thing. And I was a novice to
YouTube as well, so that&#39;s the most
visible metric. and then the likes and
and comments and all that. But for Lulu,
and again, this can change depending on
your content and how you&#39;re using video,
but what I realized over the past couple
years is the subscribers, even though we
want that, and that&#39;s a great, you know,
the more subscribers, that&#39;s great, but
what&#39;s more important for us is
click-through rates. Are people going to
the description and clicking over to
Lulu, are they getting to Lulu to take
action on the information that we&#39;re
giving them? So watch time and then the
click-through rates are really the
biggest things that um that we&#39;re
looking at now. So that&#39;s what I am
trying to improve on. And you know, you
can obviously YouTube has fantastic
analytics. I mean, we&#39;ve talked about
this before. And you can see so much. So
even if you are approaching this as a
novice like I was, it&#39;s so easy for you
to get a pretty good snapshot of what
people are liking and what they aren&#39;t,
what they&#39;re interacting with,
obviously. Um, but for me now, I mean, I
would love to get more comments and have
more of a conversation. Um, I think you
guys do such a good job with the podcast
because it&#39;s so approachable and it&#39;s
just, you know, two buds talking about
pod. It&#39;s like the podcast should be
called Pod Pod. I meant to say that.
Print on demand podcast. Pod pod. Where
were you a year and a half ago? I know.
I know. I mean, this is fine, but you
know, whatever. But this could be pod
pod. Um, so yeah, but I for for me now
really what I&#39;m trying to do is make our
um, you know, content the CTAs and
measuring that. So am I am I doing a
good job at describing the accessibility
and the ease of use or describing the
value of having a book and why you
should do it? Um, and is that compelling
enough that someone&#39;s going to go in the
description and click, okay, let me
create my account today or let me get
get over to the Lulu site. So that is
much more valuable to me now at the end
of the day. Um and previously I would
have been like well our subscriber count
is really the the holy grail, but it&#39;s
not for our for me and our business
goals. That&#39;s not the leading indicator.
So that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at is like
are we keeping retention? Are people
coming back? Is it new people that are
watching the video? Is it people who
have been in our audience for a while?
Um shout out to both. Um yeah, shout out
to our regular uh podcast episode
commenters. That&#39;s right. I see y&#39;all. I
know who you are and I appreciate every
single one of your comments. Yeah, I I
was actually having this conversation uh
the other day, but it&#39;s like I don&#39;t
know if people know when they comment
that it&#39;s us looking at them and just
responding. So, it&#39;s like shout out, you
know. So, it is, you know, it&#39;s not
anyone else. It&#39;s, you know, we&#39;re very
involved in this dayto-day. Um, so the
comments are also great because you can
see I I love being able to see the
comments in the questions that we get
and u being able to understand where we
are doing a good job explaining things
and where people do need more help or
more assistance and that also helps us
identify gaps to where we can create
more content. So, um, but yeah, the the
short answer to that would be in the
beginning subscribers, you know, I kind
of fell into that what I think all
people who are on YouTube do. Um, but
now it&#39;s really evolved like the
subscribers are great, but really I want
to see actions taken on on the content
that I&#39;m sharing. Which I think makes a
lot of sense and I think is probably the
most applicable answer to our listeners
that would be would have any interest in
this because this is still another
example of like we&#39;ve talked about so
many other times in so many different
YouTube is still rented land. Oh yeah.
in in the same way that that social
media or any other kind of like
engagement platform is, it&#39;s still
rented land. So, your long-term goal
should still be to get your subscribers,
your followers, your readers onto
something that you control, primarily an
email list. Yes. So, this is absolutely
if you&#39;re using YouTube or long form
video content or anything like that as a
way to establish yourself as a a voice
of expertise or authority or you&#39;re
using it to, you know, um, oh my god, I
just completely blanked on the words
that I was trying to say, but like
you&#39;re using it as a way to expand upon
the ideas in your book. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re
a a
cookbook author. Yeah, you could be a
chef. You could you could have said
anything that you want to do there.
You&#39;re you&#39;re a chef that has published
a cookbook and then you want to create
video content that is you demonstrating
how to create the recipe. I love that
idea. Great idea. Love that. But like
you&#39;re still Yeah, you guys can have
that one for free. No one&#39;s ever thought
of that idea before. Brand new. You
heard it here first on Pod Pod.
Brand new. All yours. You can take it.
Um just, you know, shout shout me out in
the the acknowledgements on the book.
But um you&#39;re ultimately like you&#39;re
still hoping that whatever whatever
reason you are or just you&#39;re creating
it for fun to like have a better
community and opportunity to speak to
your audience you still want to
eventually drive those people to your
own website to your own mailing list to
whatever. So I think that you&#39;re
absolutely right that looking at what
actions they&#39;re taking from the video is
really important. Yeah. And I mean again
it can evolve over time and maybe your
video content you know vehicle is
completely altruistic and that&#39;s
wonderful. Um but yeah I mean usually at
the end of the day at the very least you
want eyes on it and so yeah but that&#39;s a
great point. I sometimes when I&#39;m doing
a presentation I have this graphic that
um Alex made for me that&#39;s like uh
rented land to owned land a transaction.
It&#39;s a little funnel if you can if the
if the listener viewer can fathom that
that&#39;s what it looks like. So, um, but
yeah, it&#39;s this idea that, you know,
when you get an audience on YouTube, how
can you get them over to your website,
your email list, then that&#39;s where you
want to have the the transaction um,
occur because, yeah, YouTube is great.
Um, but there are things there that
happen that, you know, you don&#39;t have
control over. One of the things that we
were working on this year was trying to
get um, not have ads played that don&#39;t
align with our content or that don&#39;t
really serve our audience. So that&#39;s
something that you have a little bit of
control over, but you know, again,
there&#39;s there&#39;s still a lot of
opportunities for a viewer to drop off
or go somewhere else. And so making sure
that you are using that time to have
that strong CTA or at least just have a
plan in place where to connect outside
of the platform is always a good idea.
You know, we cannot emphasize this
enough. Like making sure that you have a
backup strategy for connecting with your
audience on more than one platform.
Yeah. And I mean it takes time and it it
does take effort to to do that and to
figure out that transition and make it
smooth and then compel people to do
that. But I also think you know kind of
going back to what we were talking about
in the beginning of why having video is
important. You know you&#39;re when you
build that human connection then people
want to support you directly. And I
think it&#39;s easier to make that argument
of like, hey guys, you know, as we all
know, we&#39;re living in crazy times and
this could go away tomorrow or you won&#39;t
find my content or I could be um I don&#39;t
know, not sh I mean, I guess maybe
shadowbanned, but whatever the terms are
that are like maybe suppressing your
content for the algorithm. So when you
are able to be authentic or share a
little bit about this is my creator
journey and if you are in the position
where your content creation is your main
source of business then it is a good
idea to be thinking about either
communicating that to your audience
explaining why it&#39;s so important to
connect with you on a different platform
or on your own website or your email
list. Um so that yeah you don&#39;t get the
rug um Tik Tok danced out from under you
if it gets closed down.
I I truly hope no one gets the rug
danced out from under them. That would
be a terrible way to go. But if it does,
I hope that they&#39;re filming it. Yeah.
Please please be on live while that&#39;s
happening. Um I actually I want to go
back to something that you said a little
while ago because I think it&#39;s actually
kind of an interesting point to make as
we&#39;re having this conversation. Um
because I am very good at imagining what
the critics are saying while we&#39;re
happening like while we&#39;re while we&#39;re
live on air. Um, but you said that, you
know, you were a novice with YouTube
when you first got started on YouTube.
And I am also, spoiler alert, not a
podcast expert. Uh, this was a brand new
thing to me when Matt first pitched it
to me about two years ago. He said, &#34;Do
you want to do a podcast with me?&#34; And I
said, &#34;How?&#34; Yes, boss.
I mean technically I said no first which
I have reminded him of on this podcast
before but I I mean that was my first
question was I don&#39;t know how to do any
of that so I have to learn. So you and I
have both kind of built these skill sets
over over our time working on these
various different mediums. Yeah. Um, so
I just do want to like kind of highlight
that to anybody that is listening to
this and is like, &#34;Oh, well, you know,
you guys are professionals at what you
do. So good at this. Wow.&#34; Like you&#39;re
so good at what you do. Um, but yeah, I
mean, yes, we have the backing of a
brand behind us, so we have like
resources available to us and
educational resources and financial
resources and and things like that. But
we did very much, both of us kind of
built these channels or are actively
building these channels kind of from the
ground up and and it continues to be a
learning process every day. Like I mean
I I can&#39;t speak for you. You&#39;ve been
doing this longer than I have, but I&#39;m
I&#39;m constantly can confirm. Yeah. like
learning new things, trying new things,
trying to like find new tools to do
things to make things easier, trying to
find new ways to connect with audiences
to to try different things in episode. I
mean, this is this is an episode that&#39;s
not me and Matt. We&#39;re talking something
new right now. Spoiler alert if you
haven&#39;t that hasn&#39;t come through
already. Surprise, that&#39;s not Matt
you&#39;re listening to right now. But I so
I do I just you know if you&#39;re listening
to this and you&#39;re like I you guys are
not the right people to be giving advice
about this because I don&#39;t Yeah. Like
you you&#39;re getting paid to do this
content that you&#39;re creating like No, I
think we&#39;re actually very qualified.
Yeah. Super. Yeah. Obviously the most
the most qualified people. I mean, but I
think, you know, but it&#39;s just different
because if you are doing it yourself, I
mean, there&#39;s just kind of a different
level of pressure because it, you know,
an an
ambassad and and giving yourself grace
and um you know, with our change in the
way that we&#39;ve approached video and even
deciding to do a podcast and all this is
still human people that are doing it and
I think that sometimes times when you
put video content or you put yourself
out there online, people just kind of
forget or don&#39;t believe that you have
the full suite of human emotions and you
can feel, you know, scared or
discouraged or um nervous or whatever.
So that is still very much a part of it
and imposttor syndrome is very real. I
mean, you know, to be honest, you know,
we were talking about doing this podcast
and I was like, I don&#39;t want to talk
about video content because I don&#39;t, you
know, I even though I&#39;ve been doing it
for a while, there&#39;s still so much to
learn. And even with the recent shift
and how we&#39;ve started editing our videos
or how we&#39;re, you know, filming them,
that was just kind of me looking online
and thinking, oh, you know, these
channels are doing really well and we
can do that, too. Um, and you know, so I
just want to say you have to give
yourself grace and um, and yeah,
everybody goes through the imposttor
syndrome and you will feel that unless
you&#39;re maybe you&#39;re super human and you
don&#39;t and that&#39;s fantastic, but um,
yeah, just trying it. You what if you
don&#39;t, you know, you&#39;ll never know. You
just try it. Yeah. Try it and get out
there, figure out how to make it work.
Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I was just
saying to you before this started, all
the things that you&#39;ve learned putting
this podcast together. So it&#39;s like, you
know, when you go through this, even if
it even if at the end of the day you
decide that&#39;s not for me or it&#39;s not
helping me reach my goals, you have a
whole new skill set that you can pull
from when you try the next thing. So I
think the net net is worth it. Yeah,
absolutely. I think that there is so
much value in the learning experience on
this and especially something like video
content because we really have seen I
mean I think back to social media
marketing world in March of 2020 which
is already
triggering.
It was literally social media marketing
world in San Diego in March of 2020 was
literally the last thing I did before
everything shut down. M um but at that
conference 5 years
ago, the main topic of conversation at
that conference was how important video
was going to be to social media, to
social media marketing, to social media
engagement, to like anybody, whether it
was a a massive like Fortune 500
company, to an individual influencer or
brand just trying to like make a name
for themselves in some way on social
media they they could not stop
emphasizing how important video was and
we have only seen that grow over the
last 5 years right and it was already
important even before that too like you
know YouTube has been just like the
unstoppable force it&#39;s insane it is
insane how much content is on YouTube
it&#39;s imp like think about the fact that
there was a time where YouTube there was
a time in our lifetime where YouTube
wasn&#39;t a thing I&#39;m 12 years
old Right. I am so sorry. There was a
time in my lifetime.
Are we the same age? I think we&#39;re the
same age. We&#39;re close to it. Yeah, I
think so. I think so. Are you 21? Yes.
And not a day over. Same. Same. U Yeah,
I know. Well, and I was going to say the
the point or to your point like Yeah.
And it&#39;s only gotten um more popular,
but I also just want to underscore, but
there&#39;s so many different ways to do it.
like you&#39;re saying the channels that you
like that don&#39;t you know that you can&#39;t
see the the face of the creator. Um uh
it&#39;s pretty I mean there are channels on
YouTube that are just like ambient
background noises for 10 hours that
people listen to when they&#39;re studying
or like there are channels that you can
put on Yeah, exactly. I listen to them
too or content that&#39;s like you know this
is my um you know music for cats. These
things literally exist and are doing
quite well. So um yeah. Yeah. So, I
mean, I think, you know, when you think
of video, most people I would assume or
I think think, &#34;Okay, I have to get in
front of the camera and do this.&#34; But
even saying, &#34;Hey, here&#39;s some
meditative music. I&#39;m going to do a
writing sprint. Come join me.&#34; It could
look like that. Um, you know, it could
be pictures or or um a slideshow of of
books that you&#39;ve been reading with some
commentary on it. So, there are so many
a myriad of forms that that video can
take if you&#39;re interested in exploring
it. Yeah, absolutely. and a myriad of
ways that it can become applicable to
your marketing efforts and your brand
growth efforts outside of creating video
content. Yeah, I think there&#39;s a lot of
skills that you can learn from doing
this, whether it&#39;s, you know, getting
better at listening to your audience,
getting better at at understanding what
your audience wants from you because
you&#39;re trying to figure out where those
content gaps are when you&#39;re creating
videos or what resonates with them. It
might inform what your next book is
about. Or it might inform I mean even
things as simple as
two years ago I was definitely afraid of
public speaking. Look at you now. Look
at me now. London Bookf Fair was great.
By the way, if you haven&#39;t watched that
episode, I know. Congratulations on on
that. That&#39;s insane to to go not only
did you public speak, but you public
spoke to an international audience. It
was wild. It was actually that was maybe
the worst part of it was realizing that
our American jokes were not landing on
the international
audience. Sorry. Sorry to you guys. But
but yeah, I mean we were actively we
were at London Bookf Fair when Matt
asked me if I wanted to go speak at
another event later this year by myself
without you. That&#39;s awesome. And like I
didn&#39;t even hesitate before saying yes.
Yes. Good for you. Which is insane. If
you told two years ago, Lauren, she
would have laughed in your face. So, you
know, if that&#39;s something if you&#39;re if
you&#39;re someone who has listened to our
previous episodes and has said like, &#34;I
do absolutely see the value in adding
public speaking elements to my brand,
but I&#39;m really nervous about doing
that.&#34; Or, &#34;I watched that really great
webinar with Chelsea Chandler.&#34; Oh my
Damn. Morphed into a new person.
Chelsea. Stephanie Chandler and Chelsea.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Stephanie. Yeah.
Okay, it is definitely it&#39;s lunch time.
It&#39;s It is also lunch time. Um, if you
watched that episode or webinar and
listened to the episodes where we talked
about that and were like, &#34;Yeah,
absolutely, totally. Seeing the value
add in this, but public speaking makes
me really nervous.&#34; Yeah. Maybe your
stepping stone into that is to try
creating some video content. Mhm. Doing
this where you have the option to edit
it. You have the option to re-record it.
You&#39;re not live. You&#39;re not like the
only audience in front of you is your
camera and your cat. That&#39;s right.
That&#39;s right. And maybe that&#39;s how you
bridge that gap. Yeah. You get some reps
in and you kind of understand the flow
or the cadence or slowing down the way
that you talk. Actually, I heard this
tip the other day and I thought it was
very helpful potentially. I haven&#39;t
tried it yet. But one thing that I have
um a problem with I I&#39;ll talk really
fast and especially when I&#39;m in public,
like actually public speaking, I will
just start talking really really fast
and I have to kind of take a beat. And
so I was reading a newsletter and the
guy was like you when you&#39;re preparing
for a talk, you should do some light
cardio when you&#39;re doing it so that you
can your body can adjust to like the
heightened excitement or nerves that
you&#39;ll have when you go in front of an
audience. And so I know so I have not
tried that yet. But if you are thinking
or if you have a speaking event coming
up and this happens to you then try to
jog a little bit and practice your talk
and so that when you go to it your body
is already kind of in that uh or used to
being in that state so it doesn&#39;t hit
you as hard. Um and then you can try
that out. And I&#39;ll also say that I&#39;ve
heard that your brain registers like
excitement and nervousness as the same
thing. So then kind of trying to talk do
some selft talk and be like I&#39;m excited
about this instead of being like oh my
gosh oh my gosh or trying to imagine
everybody&#39;s naked or whatever then you
know just be like I&#39;m excited I&#39;m happy
to be here I know it goes back to adding
value I know I&#39;m going to help um and
that people that are in this audience
are going to be getting a good message
that&#39;s actionable and helpful and then
see if that works out there&#39;s always
Brent up some stairs
before after or during the talk make
your audience come with During. Yeah,
during. During preferably uh my personal
favorite was uh shout out to Robbie
Fitzwwater who uh reminded me rock and
roll for sure. uh who reminded me that I
should listen to some really good hype
music right before which unfortunately
Robbie I was not able to take that
advice because it was a little bit
whirlwind and they&#39;re boring at gnome
but I did well
but I I did think about that advice as I
was getting ready and so I appreciate it
you&#39;re going through Taylor Swift&#39;s dis
discography in your mind actual fun fact
about your your tip just right there um
one of the things that she did to get
ready for for the era tour uh was she
um run, jog or walk on the treadmill for
the full length of her set list while
singing through her set list. Oh my
gosh, that&#39;s is a three and a half hour
show. So that means that she did a 3 and
1 half hour treadmill workout as her
regular training routine and was singing
while on the treadmill. So shout out to
my girl. Well, you know what? I think
that, you know, if you want to hit
Taylor Swift levels of success, if
that&#39;s the kind of person you are, then
I guess take that advice. But she&#39;s
obviously doing something right. Yeah.
Yeah. Don&#39;t
It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. Whatever. Um, do
you have any kind of I mean, we&#39;re
winding down. I feel like we could talk
about this for another hour. Oh, but now
we&#39;re in the woods. I know. We&#39;re back
in the woods. We&#39;re going to walk back
to our office now. So sad. Um, but we&#39;re
definitely going to have to come back
and talk more maybe about video or maybe
about other things.
Do you have any last like parting wisdom
or anything that you want to share?
Whether it&#39;s about, you know, shaking
off nerves or like a an action tip for
go try this right now, like while you&#39;re
thinking about it or or just like and
subscribe.
Always like and subscribe. Uh, even
though I said those metrics don&#39;t matter
to me and I&#39;m above No, like and
subscribe. But um yeah, I mean I think
just try I think the most important
thing is just give yourself a chance and
um and you may you may love it and you
may decide that it&#39;s not for you but um
give yourself a chance and give your
audience a chance to see that side of
you and and to connect with you and have
that conversation and that community and
you may end up liking it. And even if
you know, like I said, if you go through
it and you think this is not for me, it
could spur more ideas for you. That
could be your new content. Why I&#39;m not
making video content, how I got over my
nerves to make video content. Um maybe
you could get embroiled in controversy
and make an apology video. Those are
super hot right now. So, I mean, I just
I think, you know, if you feel compelled
at all to try it, then I think there&#39;s
something in you that&#39;s saying that you
can and you should. Um and yeah, it can
just be a phone. like it doesn&#39;t have to
be anything crazy. It can just be going,
you know, taking a video on your phone,
sharing, you know, whatever you feel is
appropriate or it&#39;s going to help your
audience. And I just think if that is
kind of your guidance is, you know, I
think this will be helpful and it will
reach the right people, then um you
know, you can&#39;t if you fail, you&#39;ll only
fail forward. So, try it. I love that.
Yeah, I think that&#39;s a great note to end
on. Flip it. Got it. Perfect. Thanks for
all these great sound bites. It&#39;s gonna
be really easy to make the content for
this episode. Great. Awesome. It&#39;d be
terrible if this all got scrapped. I did
such a bad job on this podcast, you
couldn&#39;t even see the light of day.
The lost episode. There is a lost
episode of this podcast. Oh, really?
Yeah. Um, there was one that we recorded
that we didn&#39;t have the soundboard for
because I had to send it to Road for
them to fix something on it and we
didn&#39;t get it back in time and it was
actually a really good episode, but the
audio sucked on it. So, yeah. Well, of
course you&#39;re going to say that. You&#39;re
right. It was terrible. I was like, it
was actually the best episode that we
ever did. It It really was. It was the
best episode we&#39;ve ever done and you
guys will never hear it now. Oh well. So
sad. Well, that&#39;s too bad. But yeah, I
just uh go go out and do it. Go out and
try it. I wish you all the best of luck.
All the likes, all the subscribes. And
um yeah, I mean obviously leave us
comments and questions if you do have um
any any questions about that and I will
be happy to help. It&#39;s just us looking
