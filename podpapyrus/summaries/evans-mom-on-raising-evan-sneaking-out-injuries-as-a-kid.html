We have Evan&#39;s mom. I think he doesn&#39;t
want you to see his room.
Well, I was just going to say, did you
clean his room?
Rolly boy. Here we go. Oh, look at him
throwing it up. Look at him throwing it
Mike, how many times have you been
pulled over in your life?
We&#39;re at 75 now.
Now, I feel like this is part of your
rebellion, but that&#39;s okay.
He&#39;s rebelling at age 30.
Got an exciting announcement for you
guys. We are doing Heydays this year.
We&#39;re uh going to be down there on the
6th and the 7th, but we&#39;re doing a
meetup on the 6th throughout the day.
We&#39;ll post that information probably on
our Instagram story later. We&#39;ll pop up
a map here so you guys can kind of see
where we are. It&#39;s the same booth as
last year. Uh if you were there, thank
you. It&#39;s hectic. You guys know the
drill. There&#39;s uh there&#39;s lots of merch
to be had. We&#39;ll be giving away an Altus
ebike and I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just it&#39;s
going to be a lit time. So, if you&#39;re in
the area or able to make it to Heyday,
that&#39;ll be awesome. booth EA7.
Yeah, it&#39;s going to get rowdy.
It&#39;s pretty much the only, I guess, big
meetup that we do all year. So, this is
your chance. Come on out, come see the
boys. We&#39;ll have some of the rigs there
and some of the different projects we&#39;re
working on. Maybe bring a wooden dirt
bike or some other stuff down and uh
show it off at the booth. But if not,
hey is a fun event. So, come on down and
check it out.
Yep. We&#39;re going to do our best to rip
through everybody in line. I know that
line gets long. So, we&#39;re going to have
someone there to take pictures and we&#39;re
going to be cruising through it. We&#39;re
going to try to meet all you guys and

Mike, welcome back from your honeymoon,
Good to be back.
How was it?
It was awesome, dude. We went to uh
Massachusetts, Cape Cod, Chattam,
Boston. It was cool like going through
my Snapchat responses and seeing all the
like there&#39;s a lot of people that are
like, &#34;Yo, you&#39;re in Mass. You&#39;re on the
East Coast. You&#39;re in New England.&#34; Cuz
think like none of us really You went to
New York once, but yeah, other than
that. So, we were like just tapping into
a lot of fans that are like, &#34;Yo, like I
didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ever be in my neck of
the woods.&#34; Finally up there. We go to
Utah and [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] all the time, but never
out there.
Think of how many times we&#39;ve been west.
Like hundreds.
It is strange, dude. I actually have
never been out east. I&#39;ve never been to
New York. I&#39;ve never been in that neck
of the woods.
I think the furthest east I&#39;ve been is
the east coast of Florida.
Yeah, obviously Florida.
Florida&#39;s hardly even world of its own.
You know,
been to Nashville, but that doesn&#39;t
really count as east.
So, what did you guys do when you were
We just went to this bougie resort, what
I call it like vineyard vines country.
It look like it. It looked beautiful out
Yeah, it was beautiful. It was really
cool cuz it&#39;s like you experience the
beaches. It&#39;s like Florida but no palm
trees. But yeah, I don&#39;t know. Like
everyone was
Was it warm? Yeah, it was hot.
You&#39;re on the ocean.
Yeah, you&#39;re right on the ocean.
Wow. Are people surfing out there?
No. No. It was It&#39;s like mostly No,
there was no waves. But, dude, it was
sick. It was like just See, it was
really funny. We sat down for a at this
fancy restaurant and it had only
seafood. So, like I&#39;m pretty excited. I
love seafood. Sydney&#39;s like doesn&#39;t like
Oh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
She&#39;s like, I don&#39;t think I can eat
here. So, then we went somewhere else
cuz they had only seafood on the menu.
Oysters are so good up there.
Yeah. I don&#39;t love oysters, but I bet
they are. They lots of lobster. They
have lobster everything.
Lobster bisque. Lobster tacos. Lobster
like sandwiches.
Lobster roll.
Lobster roll. Lobster omelets.
How north are you? Like I&#39;m trying to
picture on a map. Like how far north of
New York are you?
Like 3 hours.
Basically like the tip of Long Island
and then it&#39;s like
So expensive then.
Right north from where we were. You&#39;d go
to Maine.
How far from like the Hamptons were you?
Obviously, that&#39;s a different section,
but like geographically,
I don&#39;t know exactly how far, but it did
make me want to visit the Hamptons.
I think it was like milewise really
close, but like to get there would be
kind of a pain, unless you took a boat
or some [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
But it was sick. I love it. I recommend
that. I mean, we we we&#39;ll do like Jeep
Car Challenge or something.
Yeah. You think there&#39;s stuff for us to
do up there?
Absolutely. Just cuz of how different it
Different vibes, different people. It
was It was sick.
Where&#39;s uh Tale of the Dragon?
That&#39;s in uh Tennessee.
That&#39;s in Tennessee. So that&#39;s that&#39;s
more east. I think we should do Tail of
the Dragon, dude. I was just driving to
work today and there&#39;s like one of the
sections there&#39;s an S-curve, which seems
pretty common. It just is like a left
and then a right. And I was like, &#34;Dude,
I want to drive the Tail of the Dragon.&#34;
Well, we&#39;ll either do it in like some
really crappy cars I could see, or we
got to go on like a rally.
It&#39;d probably be crappy cars with the
way that we do things.
They could be nice cars. Just the
cheapest nice cars you can find. The
odds of us having all of our sports cars
all the way out there
over there are low. But
well, you see when Cleat did it in the
freaking motor homes.
Yeah, that exactly.
That&#39;s funny. Yeah, we were going to go
on a uh on a rally like 3 years ago.
Maybe it was four years ago. It was like
super expensive. It just made no sense.
Like it was like we were going to it was
going to cost us like I think more than
10 grand and we were going to lug like
2500 miles on our super cars at the
time. We&#39;re like
I think Yeah. just well it was also the
time too for us. We&#39;re like we can
probably only make one video out of this
if we&#39;re going to be gone for a week.
Like I could see for some guys
it would be really fun. You don&#39;t have
anybody to like go drive with. And
I&#39;m not saying it wouldn&#39;t have been
fun, but I was just saying we we were
pretty close to doing it that one time.
Yeah. The guy who won the Huracan, he&#39;s
been going on rallies all over.
Yeah. All over the place.
That&#39;s been really a treat to see.
How many miles has that guy put on that
thing? He&#39;s got to have put on 10,000
miles on that thing since 2 months ago.
I&#39;m going to DM him and ask and I&#39;ll pop
it up cuz he has been on it, dude.
It&#39;s really fun to see like this is the
first guy where we&#39;ve like actually seen
the vehicle being used after our shop
of all the giveaways. I&#39;m not saying
that the people who&#39;ve won the giveaways
and kept them aren&#39;t using them, but
just like he&#39;s all over social media and
it&#39;s like it&#39;s fun to see.
Yeah, he&#39;s capitalizing on it, which is
fun to see. Yeah, for sure. I think I
mean maybe I I don&#39;t know the
nitty-gritty, but like I think he&#39;s
respected. He&#39;s going on the rallies and
stuff, you know? Like I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a
few guys that are like you just won that
like poser, but like it&#39;s not so lame.
I agree.
That&#39;d be like getting mad at someone
for winning the lottery and having
something, you know?
They played the game, they won.
He seems like a kind of guy that would
have been there regardless of whether he
had a Lamborghiner.
That&#39;s true.
If you guys uh won the lottery, what&#39;s
the first thing you&#39;d buy?
I&#39;m trying to think of a cool answer.
Huge house on the lake.
Honestly, a big house on the lake.
A Lamborghini Huracan.
Probably a Florida house. I think
I could see you being a Florida man. Ken
Ken&#39;s trying to get far away from us.
He&#39;s like, I would not. And I wouldn&#39;t
tell you where in Florida. You&#39;d have to
figure that out.
We&#39;d be out front in like a boat. We&#39;d
pull up with one of our cheap boats and
park it.
He uses his lottery money to finish his
house and immediately sell it on top. I
I think like a place in either Cape
Coral or the Keys would be like so fun
to have a vacation place for.
I can&#39;t argue with that. What do you
think draws you to Florida, Kenny?
Cuz around here is cold as balls in the
winter. So, it&#39;s kind of like nice to
just get away
and your clientele leaves.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. The clientele goes uh
goes south.
All the work.
Southern base.
Well, how about you? What&#39; you do?
Probably just put some mods on my
Corvette. You know, something that just
you can only do when you don&#39;t care
What mods would you put on something
like that? It&#39;s all something that&#39;s
already so perfect.
Yeah. Like what can you put on that
thing for mods?
I actually kind of got ripped uh when I
posted a bunch of pictures of my car
because the sun was behind and so it
looked like I didn&#39;t have window tint
and I don&#39;t have much window tint, which
is stereotypical Corvette owner of me,
but everyone was like, &#34;Bro, come on.
Get some tint.&#34; So maybe I&#39;d put darker
window tint on my car. I&#39;d have enough
money to pay for the tickets. I&#39;d have
enough money to pay for window tint
tickets and not even care. have enough
money to uh wear a new pair of New
Balances every day in that thing.
There you go.
That&#39;s a crazy thought. Like you&#39;d have
so much money that you could actually
drive as fast as you want to an extent.
Obviously, they yank your license, but
I&#39;m saying like you you&#39;d have enough
money to pay for the best lawyers. So, a
simple, oh yeah, I was going 110 and a
70 like you could get out of that no
I&#39;m going to have to disagree with you,
Mike. I was uh living the lifestyle of
I&#39;ll just pay the tickets and now if I
get one more speeding ticket before
February I believe I lose my license.
You don&#39;t you don&#39;t have lottery money
to pay for really good lawyers is what
I&#39;m getting.
Get out of it.
I just don&#39;t know if you can. I don&#39;t
know. You did the crime, man.
I guess that&#39;s I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not
versed in that. But like I&#39;ve seen like
really really really really rich people
murder other people and then they just
have enough money to get out of it.
I think there&#39;s more there&#39;s more like
gray area on TV. It&#39;s one thing when
you&#39;re doing 60 and a 55 and you get
caught and they
You don&#39;t need lawyers to get out of
that. You need lawyers to get out.
It&#39;s another thing when you&#39;re going
almost double the speed limit. You&#39;re
you can only fight that so much.
They got cameras. They got their radar
Like you could say, &#34;Oh, like was your
radar gun calibrated?&#34; But it&#39;s like
even in the the variation, it&#39;s still
going to be like you were clearly going
well over the speed limit. So, I&#39;ve been
shopping us to get new insurance uh
because actually our old insurance
company dropped us. And so, with that,
we got new car insurance. And I&#39;ve been,
you know, we&#39;ve been shopping around
trying to get a better rate. And, uh,
how I sent all the information to the
guy didn&#39;t include like our names and
addresses cuz they only need the
driver&#39;s license number. He was like,
&#34;It&#39;s safer if you&#39;re not sending, you
know, every single person&#39;s like full
address and then, you know, different
numbers about them, right? because then
that you could get hacked. And uh he
goes, &#34;There&#39;s somebody&#39;s driver&#39;s
license here. Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] I don&#39;t know if
I&#39;ve ever seen that many tickets.&#34;
Had to have been Mike&#39;s.
And I go, &#34;Oh yeah, probably Mike&#39;s or
Dalton.&#34; They go, &#34;No, it&#39;s like a
speeding ticket every 6 months for the
last 6 years.&#34; And I was like, &#34;It&#39;s
I actually don&#39;t have that many tickets
for how many times I&#39;ve been pulled
Yeah. You just get warnings like that.
Well, you you don&#39;t get pulled over for
speeding. I get pulled over
all kinds. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And a
lot of times speeding you&#39;re getting a
I mean obviously I have been doing a
pretty good job of not speeding lately
because I still have my license but uh I
don&#39;t know like once those wipe off I&#39;m
probably going to put the pedal to the
floor a little.
It&#39;s going to be 5 years before those
like fall off completely.
Yeah. But you you have to have them
within a year. So like you can only have
three in a year.
So you can you got to get it down to two
in a year then?
Yeah. In February then one drops off
then I&#39;m chilling. But I got the problem
was is I got one in February and then I
got one in like literally three weeks
later. I was like [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] a like I
burned two of them.
How am I gonna do this? But I&#39;ve done
it. So pretty impressive. I mean it
helps not having a fast fast car. But I
mean still the the the Raptor Rick and
just a semi pickup.
But I mean in a Huracan or like a
Corvette like
it&#39;s just easy.
I think that&#39;s just how it is.
Yeah. It&#39;s just hard enough. Why not
don&#39;t even drive the thing if you&#39;re not
even going to drive it fast?
Obviously, the less you put your foot
down, the less you&#39;ll probably get
caught for speeding. But like it&#39;s
really just time and place. Like bad
time, bad place. Because it&#39;s like,
dude, think like I just rip. Like on my
way from Fargo, I rip.
And it&#39;s like you could literally do
that for a year straight and just be
chilling because of the time. Like you
go go at a different time.
You need to know where they&#39;ll park too.
Like if you&#39;re driving, I&#39;m not
condoning speeding, but if you&#39;re
driving down the interstate and there&#39;s
just guard rails on both sides, they&#39;re
not going to be there. Like often times
they they have to be on the other side
and then they like to catch you like
they&#39;re not
you&#39;re coming over a hill, assume
they&#39;re going to be there.
Yeah. Yeah. Stuff like that for sure.
Or if but if it&#39;s like a road you
travel, you can you kind of get to know
like this is where they&#39;ll sit.
Yeah. So this is a safe spot where
they&#39;ll sit because it&#39;s covered by
They&#39;re always parked on like the one
on-ramp just out of town. There&#39;s one
median behind a bridge they always park
But realistically, why are you listening
to me? Explain what
Yeah, it sounds like you&#39;re not doing
too good at it.
So, so don&#39;t even listen to me.
The insurance guy originally was like,
&#34;Yeah, CJ might not be able to drive any
of the company vehicles. We might not be
able to insure him.&#34;
And I was like, I
any of the fun vehicles are you don&#39;t
have insurance on anyways, so it doesn&#39;t
even matter. I just wouldn&#39;t be driving
the company truck or the sprinter van.
It&#39;s pretty good, actually. Looks like
sounds like you out pretty good.
I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll ride in the back.
that&#39;s true. You really wouldn&#39;t be out
too much. A minor inconvenience here and
there, dude. It&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;m
just going to say it now. One of us will
lose our license.
I don&#39;t like putting that out in the
world, dude.
I think I&#39;m two speeding tickets away.
But again, wrong place, wrong time. That
could happen in a matter of weeks.
Mike, how many times have you been
pulled over in your life?
We&#39;re at 75 now.
It&#39;s a lot.
That&#39;s a lot of times been pulled over.
kind of stopped paying attention like
cuz I know like 5 years ago you were at
like 20 something which seemed like a
Really ramped it up.
Yeah, dude. I get pulled over all the
But you are putting on a lot of miles.
You&#39;re driving to Fargo and back.
Yeah, there is that. I don&#39;t know what
it is, man. Like because think
I think it&#39;s your cars.
Yes, I agree with that. But it is still
funny that like I&#39;m in a different car
every time. So it&#39;s not like they&#39;re
like getting to know my vehicle.
But all of your vehicles are highly
illegal and highly modified. Yeah, I
wouldn&#39;t say that highly illegal part,
yeah, they&#39;re not highly highly
modified. They&#39;re just standout. Yellow
Subie, giant black Ram,
red Viper.
Yeah, if I need to go inconspicuous, I&#39;m
hopping in the Beamer.
Yeah, it&#39;s probably your most
inconspicuous car.
You don&#39;t drive that thing much anymore,
do you?
No. I There&#39;s holes in the trunk right
Yeah. What&#39;s What&#39;s the plan with that?
So, you&#39;re going to put a wing on it and
Yeah, I just haven&#39;t had time. I got to
put the trunk back together.
legitimately like so low on my list that
it&#39;s just sad.
What you were going to do like a duck
bill spoiler and that didn&#39;t
I was Yeah, dude. I&#39;m just like I don&#39;t
know if I ever said that probably cuz
it&#39;s not important, but I was like I
want to put a duck bill trunk on it. I
don&#39;t want this shitty eBay wing on it
anymore. And then I bought a trunk
that&#39;s for a coupe, not a convertible.
Had it painted is full carbon fiber
trunk. I was like, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m going to
get moving on this. I want to get this
back on the road.&#34; Got it painted and
I&#39;m like, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; Oh, I like go to
size it up, which I should have done
before I painted it, and then I&#39;m like,
this isn&#39;t even close.
Close. No.
So then now I just have like a carbon
trunk painted white that
for a BMW. What series?
6 series.
6 series. Somebody out there. BMW 6
series painted white.
Painted white. I&#39;m sure you could strip
the paint back to carbon reccleed. I
don&#39;t know. But
the guy who you bought your Beamer from
during Money Mike&#39;s junk tank, he
reached out to me and was like, &#34;Dude, I
want to buy that back.&#34; Oh, I should say
his friend his friend reached out to me
and was like, &#34;I want to buy it back.&#34;
I&#39;m like, &#34;Perfect. You can buy it
back.&#34; I haven&#39;t heard from him in a
minute. But
he&#39;s probably just [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] with you.
He was like, &#34;Let&#39;s see.&#34;
They laugh. He actually thought we
wanted to buy it back.

You haven&#39;t driven that thing once, I
don&#39;t think.
I don&#39;t think it works.
It&#39;s not true, but I haven&#39;t driven it
in a long time.
You drove it down the gravel road and
then something happened. It broke.
Yeah. Yeah. I drove it. Yeah. Like I
drove it. I&#39;m like, &#34;This is not like
how did he drive this here?&#34; And then I
remember that he trailered it
and then I drove it to TJ&#39;s once and
that&#39;s when I was like, &#34;Dude, this
thing is not
I remember last winter we had to we had
to move it so they could plow snow and
then it just it hasn&#39;t moved since
Oh yeah. On the coldest day of the year
with that Russian guy that didn&#39;t know
any English
when he was delivering the dozer and
then the dozer like literally took 24
hours to warm up. Oh yeah, that was
crazy, man. Winter just is tough. Too
important.
I&#39;m enjoying the heck out of summer as
everyone does and is. But dude, I&#39;m like
can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already August.
I&#39;m ready for football season, dude. I&#39;m
ready to get back on my uh DraftKings
grind. Start placing some bets. I&#39;ve had
a pretty profitable uh I don&#39;t know,
last seven days, my gambling.
pulled 1,400 in pull tabs. Just hit on a
couple DraftKings bets for UFC. We all
we all split a $500 win last weekend.
Oh yeah. And then we we then two nights
ago we went out to eat on your pontoon
and pulled 500.
Yeah. Last night Alandre won another
hundred at
That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.
Yeah, dude. We spin up.
Yeah, the pull tabs have been very very
profitable this summer.
Dude, same for EV.
Ev is not profitable. There&#39;s no way.
Well, to be honest with you, totally
agree. No matter how much that dude
wins, I agree that he&#39;s not profitable.
But like, yeah, every time I&#39;ve watched
him play pull tabs in the last month or
gotten a snap from him, like it&#39;s big
wins. So, I don&#39;t know.
How much did he put in though?
It also sounds like he&#39;s putting in a
disgusting amount of money into it to
win that.
Wow. Yeah, he like show sent a snap like
he&#39;s at like a $2,000 hand payout or
whatever for his slot machine wherever
he was this weekend. But each click of
the button was at $1850.
Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
So, that&#39;s a lot, right? For perin.
That&#39;s a low win for that wage. Yeah.
Oh my god, dude.
Evan&#39;s [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] betting 20
bucks hand someone a
five clicks and you&#39;re down 100. Another
five. Another 100.
When I go to Vegas, I&#39;ll bet like five
bucks 10 at most and I&#39;ll get like a
$5,000 hand pay there.
What&#39;s the What&#39;s the most you can bet?
And he&#39;s just at probably that&#39;s
probably close to max for Minnesota.
It&#39;s got to be. But yeah, I was like if
you go into the you know when there&#39;s
like the 10-centent denominations,
that&#39;s when will always get me. If
you&#39;re in the wrong denomination or
whatever, 1 cent, 2 cent, 5-cent,
10-centent, you can like be accidentally
betting 10 bucks very easily.
We&#39;re playing in a golf tournament
tomorrow. Me, Evan, his dad, Grandpa
Ron, and Dalton.
Yeah. Grandpa Ron and and myself, we&#39;re
kind of just more there for like moral
support. But Dalton, Evan&#39;s dad, and
Evan, they&#39;re pretty good at golf. Like,
they&#39;re going to be hitting it. I think
we could win. So, basically last year
they won the tournament. It was Ben,
Grandpa Ron, Evan, and Evan&#39;s dad.
Uh, now Ben&#39;s in Croatia. So, I got to
fill in for Ben. And they said there was
one more spot. So, I was like, pretty
damn good at golf. Let&#39;s get him in.
So, now there&#39;s a team of five.
Well, it&#39;s nice, too, cuz that just adds
one more person hitting.
Scramble. So, you play the best or
everybody hits a different shot.
Yeah. It&#39;s like some kind of business
like it&#39;s just like a charity event. But
apparently,
can you win?
Yeah. Yeah. You win.
What can you if if you win what you win?
I don&#39;t know what you win. If we win
if you win money or like a gift card,
right? But, uh, pretty exciting. Evan&#39;s
going to be showing up here soon.
Yeah, he might jump in at the end of
this. It&#39;s his mom&#39;s first time. She&#39;s
never been to the shop.
I know. And she&#39;s been wanting to come
for years.
Evan&#39;s worked here for what, like 5
So weird.
She&#39;s wanting to come for four years and
he won&#39;t let her. Well, she&#39;s finally
doing it. She&#39;s making it happen. I&#39;m
happy for her.
I just dropped some packages that he
received in his room and it&#39;s it&#39;s not
looking clean. Yeah, she&#39;s I&#39;m sure
she&#39;s not expecting his room to be
clean, though. When she
raised him, she knows.
Yeah. You think she probably just knows
better to not even go in?
Maybe we&#39;ll Maybe we&#39;ll pull them on
when they get here.
I think I want to
divert them away from the room.
I&#39;m also doing a golf tournament this
afternoon.
Really? Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
I know. Absolutely. I know. I&#39;m sure
I was told on Sunday, &#34;Hey, you&#39;re
you&#39;re in for a golf tournament.&#34; Um, so
I was like, &#34;Oh, okay, cool. I know
nothing about it.&#34;
Wait, who&#39;s your teammates?
and it&#39;s this afternoon. Yeah,
that&#39;s awesome, dude.
It&#39;s Oh, Gavin&#39;s in it. Um
Gavin Elen.
Is Gavin Elen golf this year?
Yeah, you got
So, are you guys trying to win this
tournament?
I think is going to carry the team. And
then Oh, he&#39;s in it, too.
So, you&#39;ve got some good golfers on your
team, but you also have you and Gavin.
Uh me.
And I&#39;ve never seen Gavin golf. And
you&#39;ve gotten a lot better. To give you
a lot of credit, you have gotten a lot
Ken&#39;s gotten better.
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] yeah.
I think my worst game of golf was last
week. Look at this swing.
My swing is god awful. Well, I&#39;m not
saying he&#39;s good, but I&#39;m just saying
you&#39;ve gotten better cuz there was a
time when you couldn&#39;t hit the ball and
now now I can go out with you and we&#39;re
your story, Ryan. I had to screen record
I love when Ryan goes when Ken you top
the ball and then you start walking
towards your ball before
before it&#39;s even landed. That&#39;s that&#39;s
actually why I posted that is because I
thought it was so funny. You knew you&#39;re
like, &#34;Buck, I&#39;m going to go pick it up
and try again.&#34; But you have you have
gotten better.
Thank you. Now, yeah. Now, I&#39;d say you
you still like have those balls that are
just like what the you&#39;re just
frustrated. But then every once in a
it&#39;s just like poof right down the
One decent hit per round of golf.
That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.
No, you like you get like one decent hit
per hole.
That&#39;s what I shoot for is one good hit
per hole. Something I can be happy
Dude, it&#39;s pretty sad around here for
not speaking for you since you&#39;ve been
put in some time, but if I&#39;m playing
nine or 18 and I par once, I&#39;m stoked.
If I if I par twice in 18 holes, I&#39;m
I played with Dalton one day and he
said, &#34;Dude, honestly, like that was a
good round. I&#39;m proud of you.&#34; And I was
like, &#34;Oh, thank you, Le. I didn&#39;t I
didn&#39;t think I played the way.&#34; He goes,
&#34;No, dude. If I had shot that bad in the
first three holes, I would have just
walked off the court.&#34;
I was like, &#34;Damn, bro.&#34; Okay.
What a backhanded combo. He&#39;s like,
&#34;Yeah, that was I like I&#39;m really proud
of you.&#34; And it was just me having the
mental toughness
to keep playing through even though I
didn&#39;t even know I could do any better.
I was giving Daltton a hard time because
So what&#39;s the general consensus? Like
you get one breakfast ball
per he takes quite a few.
Yes. So he So at least that&#39;s what I was
saying. He&#39;s like dropping another ball
aka what I thought a breakfast ball on
like legit five of the nine holes we
played. And I&#39;m like, &#34;Dude, Dalton
ripping all these breakfast balls. No
wonder you&#39;re playing so good.&#34; And then
he said he was taking a stroke on all of
them except for his one breakfast ball,
which I wasn&#39;t paying attention to his
scorecard, but I&#39;m like, well, that&#39;s
fine, I guess. Like, because think when
I do such a bad drive, I&#39;m basically
guaranteed not to par the hole. But like
if I took a stroke and then hit a good
drive, I think I&#39;d be better off, too.
But it just seems like
I&#39;ll just call that ball a loss and hit
another one.
Yeah, Ken goes through like a But then
what do you do?
But then what do you do? You count a
stroke. I mean, I&#39;m not actually keeping
keeping track.
Just keeping track of how many water
hazards and transfusions we have, right?
That&#39;s what that&#39;s what I go there for.
Well, that&#39;ll be fun. Little golf
tournament.
That Tik Tok you sent, Ryan, yesterday.
Which one?
You might just have to play it cuz it&#39;s
so out of left field. There&#39;s like two
chicks talking about like
Oh, yeah. What the [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Talking about special underground drink
you can get from a cart girl. Is it like
a specific cart girl at a I&#39;ve never
heard of that around here.
No. Same.
At my dad&#39;s favorite golf cart, the cart
girls give like there&#39;s a off menu thing
you can order called the ground and
pound and they like lay these 55year-old
guys down on the ground or 60-year-old
guys and they [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] titty punch them
like back and forth.
Oh my god. Well,
I know. I&#39;m Detroit Lakes.
Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.
Oh my god, that sounds really It&#39;s like
a three and a half hour.
That&#39;s where I picked up my dad. Yeah,
that&#39;s my hometown.
No way.
Fun. That&#39;s so fun.
But yeah, that&#39;s what I want to go
golfing with my dad for the first time
Can we come?
It&#39;s great to go get some ground and
Dude, I want to see this.
So yeah, basically this guy is saying
that there&#39;s an underground drink at one
of the courses in DL called the ground
and pound where the cart girl gets on
you and then starts like punch like
whailing on your chest.
Every single person is I recognize some
of these people too. They&#39;re like, &#34;What
course is this?&#34; Like local guys are
like where the hell is this?
I&#39;d love to see this happen.
Like is it so underground? Like even the
locals don&#39;t know about it.
Punching their tits. What if you don&#39;t
have man tits?
I think I think just chess probably.
Yeah. I mean I could still punch you.
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] But yeah, it&#39;s so specific when
you hear a Tik Tok about your hometown
when it&#39;s anything especially something
weird that you are like
especially like our town. Like I feel
like you if you lived in a big town like
Minneapolis or Miami or something like
that or you know I&#39;m trying to think of
like a big Omaha you&#39;re like okay well
it&#39;s it&#39;s a big town you know lots of
people are here but you start naming off
something that happens in a town with
6,000 people. You&#39;re like what the hell?
Actually, that reminds me. I saw a Tik
Tok about uh the Fargo Jet Center, and
apparently it&#39;s like this guy who tracks
private jets as they like fly around and
it&#39;s about Elon Musk flying from
Wow. It gives you all the stats on that.
Elon Musk was in
Yeah. So, it&#39;s it shows like he flew to
North Dakota to get fuel and then here&#39;s
Rihanna from France to Fargo, North
And then they just fuel up and keep
I guess. Yeah,
I think they do that cuz it&#39;s easy to go
through customs in Fargo and it&#39;s like a
a good midway point.
Yeah, it is a good midway point. I love
like she paid $29,867
in fuel for this 9 hour and 18 minute
flight. Very specific.
Damn. So, there&#39;s just celebrities going
through there all the time.
That&#39;s what I was thinking about that. I
was like, if you were really watching
the skies in Fargo, I have like my
cousin works at the jet center. I don&#39;t
know. He&#39;s never said anything about
Rihanna. If you really watch
probably, honestly,
there&#39;s like a good amount of uh like
PJs flying in and out of there.
That&#39;s pretty crazy. It&#39;s crazy to think
that freaking Elon and Rihanna have
Elon&#39;s the craziest to me. But
imagine him coming in to Fargo. I&#39;m
sitting there in my dorm at NDSU
watching the planes.
There&#39;s a I think it&#39;s an Elon jet
tracker and it he uses that thing like
every day, multiple times a day.
That thing&#39;s going all over the place.
I mean, if you&#39;re that rich, time is
your only constraint. I just got a text
from a avid local golfer and she says
that that Tik Tok is fake news. Fake
news. Seemed like it seemed like fake
news. I agree. I bet that guy was just
Maybe it was from a time before, you
know. Maybe there&#39;s just one cart girl
back in the day that specialized in the
ground and pound.
The ground.
Exactly. I think
you should ask for it today, CJ.
I&#39;ll see. I&#39;m sure Evan would do it.
Yeah. Tell him to get it or have Evan&#39;s
dad get it.
Try the ground and pound. She just gets
on him, just starts beating him up. I
was scrolling through Instagram and I
noticed that 50 Cents whole Instagram is
AI. You guys notice that?
Yeah, I&#39;ve seen that. Is he? Cuz he&#39;s
just like kind of just roasting people
with his AI videos and also like laughs
at people who think that they&#39;re
laughing at him.
I don&#39;t know. He like kind of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] posts
them, but like I don&#39;t know. He just
like posts random things. It&#39;s like this
is pretty clearly AI.
Got a lot of likes.
Yeah. I didn&#39;t know 50.
I know. Yeah. His 50 Cents like
Instagram is a whole thing.
Is it?
What&#39;s What&#39;s the deal with it? Like I
just saw it one day.
I think he did. He&#39;s just like being
woke saying f you to basically anyone
Is he woke?
Sorry, not woke. Uh based
based. I was opposite on that. I was
opposite on that.
What&#39;s based?
Based me in on that.
The opposite of woke. I don&#39;t know. I
chat GPT. Like based is like the
nonpolitical way of saying you&#39;re not
brainwashed.
Oh, okay.
I&#39;d say I&#39;m pretty based.
Yeah. I&#39;d say this. What
boys in general are based.
I love uh all the people when you said
in the video 67.
Yeah. I don&#39;t get that. What&#39;s up with
that? I&#39;ve been getting kids.
I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re kids, but saying
CJ said it&#39;s 67. What is that? I don&#39;t
get it.
Mike, you know the lawyer.
No, I actually I actually don&#39;t. But but
I don&#39;t let it stress me out. CJ,
it&#39;s it&#39;s not stress me out. I&#39;m just
genuinely curious, but also not curious
enough to look it up.
Yeah, exactly. It&#39;s just like a new from
an outside standpoint. It&#39;s just a
Let me look on chat.
It&#39;s like from a song, I think. Or maybe
the song came from it later. But
I think we got to get Dalton in here and
Yeah, Daltton knows what it is.
He knows how to explain all these little
cuz he like said it to me. He&#39;s like 67
and I&#39;m like
I think it&#39;s just like a thing,
you know? Six and then I just think way
back to like Spongebob.
Yeah. Yeah.
You know what&#39;s funnier than 24? 25. If
I said that to someone who didn&#39;t know
what Spongebob was, they&#39;d be like,
&#34;That&#39;s not funny.&#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;Yeah,
it is.&#34;
It was a Tik Tok trend. There was a a
song by Skrilla which says Doot 67,
which is referring to 67th Street in
Chicago, which is a gang area. And then
they started doing Tik Tok trends to
LaMelo Ball, who is 67. And so when the
announcers say 67, then the beat goes
off. Got it. And then it&#39;s him.
Okay. That&#39;s what most
Yeah, he showed me that, but I had no
idea what he was talking about.
I guess that kind of cuz most of them
that I&#39;ve seen has been around LaMelo
Ball. He&#39;s 67. Also, we got a official
definition on based. It&#39;s an internet
slang/modern term. Based is being
unapologetically yourself, not caring
what others think, and standing firm in
your beliefs. Often used as the opposite
of cringe.
You&#39;re pretty based, Siege. I feel like
weird using that term.
I&#39;m pretty based.
Yeah. Can we just use like normal words?
That&#39;s a pretty normal word. It just
might have a new definition that you
aren&#39;t familiar with.
Just like a traditional like just normal
stuff, not these words.
What word would you use, Ken?
Just you&#39;re grounded.
I like that. I like that. The
traditional
grounded Ken flips it. I like it.
Oh, he&#39;s such a good guy. He&#39;s so
I mean grounded is a that&#39;s how you
correct term, Ken. So CJ, you getting a
Harley or what? I&#39;m still trying to find
one, dude. It&#39;s just nothing, dude.
Like, bro, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Fenny&#39;s
like posted it. But anyway, Spenny got a
Dina and it it show he had it delivered
from some subscribers on last Friday or
two Fridays ago, like right after we got
back from Sturgis. And then like we&#39;re
like, &#34;Yeah, this thing&#39;s sick.&#34; Yeah.
We&#39;re like kind of standing around
looking at it and you hear CJ in the
background. You still have that Road
Glide available in the background. Like
legitimately on the phone with
dealerships. It just is funny,
dude. Everyone wants way more than what
it&#39;s worth.
It&#39;s one of those things like they put
the nice shocks on and then uh you know
the Baja Designs lights and stuff like
that and then they&#39;re like now the
bike&#39;s worth three grand more. But it&#39;s
it&#39;s why you haven&#39;t sold it in 6
months, you know, like if it&#39;s sitting
there if it&#39;s sitting on Facebook
Marketplace for 6 months, you probably
have your price too high or no one
actually likes it.
Like I get in a world where there&#39;s like
supply and demand. So, it&#39;s like if
you&#39;re looking for like a bike with a
bunch of extra amenities, like you might
pay a little more for it, but you just
can&#39;t walk into it expecting to get more
money just because you tricked it out.
Yeah. I just I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever
overpaid for anything. I don&#39;t know if I
ever have.
If you&#39;ve ever overpaid for anything,
I just don&#39;t do that. Like, I just won&#39;t
buy it if that&#39;s the case. Like, I don&#39;t
know. I&#39;m just looking at like any of my
cars. you do spend the time to do the
research and make sure
you&#39;re opposite of it makes selling it
so much easier too then because you&#39;re
just like well I got into it at the
right price if not a great price and
then you can either sell it at what you
bought it for or you know a little less.
That&#39;s true. You do like the work on the
front front end of when you&#39;re buying it
to make your backend sale really easy.
Yeah. You know the worst part though is
like as more and more time goes on the
less I want a Harley cuz like now I&#39;m
like the itch is going away. I&#39;m like,
&#34;Well, now it&#39;s damn near
that&#39;s why.&#34; Yeah, I brought it up now
thinking exactly that. As soon as I
asked it, I&#39;m like, &#34;Well, as soon as
fall comes, it&#39;s like, dude, there&#39;s not
really any point until next year.
If one popped up for a good price, I&#39;d
do it.&#34; But
I feel like you got until at least
you&#39;re through October to
I isn&#39;t Isn&#39;t it unfortunate that we
think that way? And I know a lot of
people who experience winter like all
across the Midwest, all in Canada, like
when you experience the cold temperature
change, you just like chalk a lot of
those like ah, it&#39;s just about winter.
when realistically it&#39;s not. It&#39;s
probably not a good idea to buy a rear
wheel drive sports car in November cuz
you&#39;re coming in winter, but you kind of
chalk it up as like, well, it&#39;s like
almost fall, so
but you might be able to get the best
deal trying to buy one.
That&#39;s what I was going to say. See,
you&#39;re waiting. You&#39;re going in the best
season. That&#39;s true.
Cuz people are going to be parking these
things for the winter. They might be
like, &#34;Ah, I I don&#39;t want to have uh
this sitting on my books for the winter.
I&#39;ll get rid of this.&#34; And uh
and we&#39;re two for two. I&#39;m going to
Sturgis. Went two years in a row. Who
We might end up being back three years
in a row for sure going back.
You need a hog to crank.
One thing I want to do is I want to
trade the G Wagon on a Lamborghini
Huracan and then just drive it in the
Like a all-wheel drive one cuz like
straight up you just don&#39;t have enough
time to like really drive those cars. So
if you just got like a little bit older
one that&#39;s already pretty depreciated,
throw some Blizzax on. It&#39;d be kind of
Completely agree. And obviously you
still have the Raptor to fall back on.
So, it&#39;s like cuz you you need it. You
know, there&#39;s those days where
there&#39;s days where it wouldn&#39;t work. I
wanted to get an -ay vet and drive that.
They&#39;re all-wheel drive.
That would be sick.
Ryan, I don&#39;t know how you do it without
a pickup. I was just thinking about this
the other day. I had to run to the store
and get some like piping for the guys
that are working on the front lawn. And
I almost hopped in Alex&#39;s car cuz I
didn&#39;t realize how big it was going to
be. And then I ended up taking the truck
cuz I couldn&#39;t find her keys. And so I
get there, I&#39;m like, &#34;Wow, I&#39;m glad I
took the truck because I don&#39;t know how
I would have hauled this.&#34; And then when
I was driving home, I was like, &#34;Man,
what did I do before I owned a pickup
and I was like, I&#39;d have to run and get
the company truck and
it would be a pain in the butt.&#34; Uh,
you&#39;d be surprised. You can fit quite a
bit of stuff in the back of the Hummer.
I fit like
Yeah. through the back window comes
honestly. I It is like you you have to
plan. Like I just don&#39;t make trips. I
hauled a shitload of mulch in that thing
actually, come to think of it, which
would have been way easier with a
pickup, but like just kind of make it
Fold the seats down. It&#39;s got plenty of
But I do agree. Life is better with a
pickup. It&#39;s like having a skid steer.
Like you can get by without having a
skid steer in your life. But once you
have it, it&#39;s way better.
Yeah, dude. I just remember as soon as I
got my own pickup, my very first pickup,
which was my black Raptor, I was just
like, man, this is the best. Yeah, I
just loved that truck. I mean, I&#39;d still
be driving it today if I wouldn&#39;t have
had the opportunity to get my Raptor R
at MSRP.
You&#39;re such a pickup, man.
Yeah. Well, I think about like people in
any foreign country that like doesn&#39;t
really have trucks, you know, like the
key trucks like their version of the
truck and then they have are they key or
K? I don&#39;t know.
But a truck here is an amenity, but it&#39;s
very obtainable. You know, you could get
an old Chevy or whatever. But think of
living somewhere where just like having
a truck is like not a thing.
Well, they&#39;re just smaller trucks, but
they have the same bed size. Like a K
truck has a similar bed size, which I
don&#39;t doesn&#39;t seem possible, but they
say like cubic or payload capacity is
similar to a fulls size pickup.
I believe the payload
will work hard to do, man. We&#39;ve seen
what those things.
I guess you do have a point though. Like
if you&#39;re driving a key truck, like you
could still take your garbage, your
mulch, your you could put your bikes in
the back.
Did you see that the uh US government
put a warning out on the K trucks?
I did. Yeah. That&#39;s unfortunate. They
become they become more and more popular
and people are buying them, but they put
a warning like these are super dangerous
and they don&#39;t suggest driving them on a
road that&#39;s over like 50 mph just
because if you get in a crash obviously
you&#39;re think nothing to them. I mean
those things are so sketchy driving at
that speed. Like they don&#39;t feel
comfortable driving that speed at least.
Yeah. I guess that&#39;s maybe the upside.
They literally like the smart car
barely go 65. So
Ryan, what&#39;s the deal with uh your
Hummer? That thing&#39;s lost a lot of
Yeah, when you were talking about before
we switch on that, a key truck has the
same length bed as a full size pickup,
like a short bed like your Raptor, but
it is only 4 ft wide and it&#39;s 12 in deep
versus bigger. But anyway,
I&#39;m going somewhere funny with this, but
yeah, just tell me.
Yeah, no. About my Hummer.
What did you get into it for?
I have a funny story about it. Uh, I
bought my Hummer at MSRP for 102 and now
it&#39;s probably worth Well, I have an
accident on it. It&#39;s probably worth
Oh, that&#39;s not that bad.
It&#39;s pretty bad.
I thought it was like worth like
It could be worse. You could have bought
I compare any situation to Ken&#39;s here,
Ken&#39;s lost money. I lost a whole load of
money on my Model S. Basically, if
there&#39;s anything to learn, electric
vehicles do not hold their value.
My my Model Y, it did hold the value. I
actually made money on that car.
You had a Yeah, it was a good time.
It was a couple thousand bucks, but I
did make money on that one. The Model X
completely wiped that out.
So, yeah. No, I would say I tell people
People ask, &#34;Do you like your Hummer?&#34;
And I&#39;m like, &#34;Yes.&#34; And then they say,
&#34;Should I get one?&#34; And I say,
&#34;Absolutely [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] not.&#34; Cuz it&#39;s just
Well, you&#39;re already in it now. You got
to run it. You got to run it. Yeah.
Randy was telling me, your dad, he was
like, &#34;Yeah, I was telling Ryan like if
you&#39;re even going to sell that thing,
you might as well just put it up on the
pole with the other one cuz you&#39;re
losing so much money.&#34;
He was.
Yeah. That&#39;s what he said to me. And I
was just like, &#34;Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] that thing&#39;s
dropped that much.&#34; And then I wonder
what he thinks it&#39;s worth.
He probably thinks it&#39;s worth like
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] 25. Yeah. Something real bad.
But so then that that&#39;s where where I
was going is you&#39;re remodeling your
house, Ryan. Right.
Yeah. And as we saw how Ken remodeled
his house. What if we took your Hummer
Oh, the Hummer that&#39;s actually worth
something. The one that&#39;s appreciating.
Yeah. The one with the pontoons on the
side. Y
and you either use that to take your
house down or like dropped it on it or
something like that.
I feel
I think that&#39;d be legendary. Like if
you&#39;re going to tear it down or tear
get a wrecking ball.
Wrecking ball is not as fun.
No, like a Hummer that&#39;s not the Hummer
pontoon and then we use that as a
wrecking ball. Oh, I swing my Hummer
around from a crane. That&#39;d be sick. I
don&#39;t know if I could drive it into my
house. I don&#39;t think I could get like
cuz I have the foundation.
Yeah, come to a dead stop like Ken.
It is a Hummer. It is a Hummer. Your
your breakover angle is pretty darn good
on those things.
Can you imagine the neighbors watching
that? We have a crane with a Hummer
using it as a wrecking ball.
Swinging. Holy [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
Yeah, I&#39;d be down.
I think we should at least film some
kind of segment of uh tearing down your
house. The only problem is you&#39;re
keeping part of it.
I&#39;m keeping the back half of the house.
That&#39;s what makes it a little tricky cuz
Ken&#39;s it was like nothing was off
The whole structure of mine was
You imagine we like do that and the
Hummer starts on fire in the house and
burns the whole thing down just cooked
and you&#39;re like, &#34;Well, it looks like
we&#39;re doing the whole house.&#34;
Hey, then insurance gets to pay for part
of it.
I don&#39;t think insurance covers you
driving your own vehicle in your house
intentionally and then it&#39;s starting on
We already can&#39;t get insurance. We do
Yeah. Let alone having a claim. That&#39;s
what I was telling our insurance guy. I
was like, &#34;Listen, literally a tornado
has to come for us to have a claim.&#34;
No, I&#39;d be down. I think I think if
we&#39;re going to take it down, we have to
do something in it. Like, I think we
have to do like a rage room inside or or
something. We got to do something.
That&#39;d be a good business idea for us if
we had rage rooms since like we like
breaking stuff and then it&#39;s like you
can come and experience what it&#39;s like
to break a bunch of [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;]
dude. Yes. You get the VIP experience.
You get to like burn a motor down on a
on a motorcycle or something.
We have like the crazy Yeah. has like a
Harley in there with a brand new back
I thought that was the most fun part of
tearing my place down was going in with
baseball bats and just hitting
it. Dude, I can&#39;t decide what was my
favorite part of Ken&#39;s house getting
torn down. Us going in initially and
like seeing everything and being in
shock or literally playing baseball with
all the dishes in there and just
everything. But it was strange because
it was like your house was it was like
someone just got up and left.
Yeah. It wasn&#39;t really your house. Like
I feel like mine&#39;s going to feel like my
house, dude. Feel way different.
It was set up like a house though. Like
there was TVs, there was couches, there
uh dishes. So like there it was like
basically just going into a house.
Granted a super outdated one because
like they left in like 2008 and then
never came
never touched. It was like a time cap.
So it was very strange. But uh just like
going into someone&#39;s house and just
breaking everything. That was pretty
I thought that was way more fun than
driving the car through it. driving the
car through the garage was fun and then
hitting the house was kind of just like
eh I don&#39;t know
the garage like uh just just from an
outside standpoint Chevy finally broke
the backside of the garage it was just
like cherry
yeah that was I don&#39;t know that was
equal I I kind of think it was a tie
dude Evan launching that thing in
reverse just ghost riding it and then we
almost sent it into
neighbor&#39;s house neighbor&#39;s house
that would have been bad
did the neighborhood ever talk to you
about that your ne you live in a pretty
vocal neighborhood the ones I talked to
they actually loved it cuz they wanted
to see that house torn down.
They were like, &#34;It&#39;s a byproduct.&#34; I
I heard from the contractors that some
other people that talked to them were
not the most thrilled about the way it
got done, but they loved that the house
went away.
I mean, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] you were there in freaking
November. They They were long gone.
It was Tuesday. It was 2:00 on a Tuesday
and we were over there.
If we like went over there on like
Fourth of July weekend and started
ramming into Ken&#39;s house,
that would be bad.
That&#39;d be more entertaining than the
fireworks. I&#39;d be happy.
That&#39;s true. I&#39;d come down.
A lot of people would like it. Some
people wouldn&#39;t. You know, it&#39;s just
tough to please everyone.
Pay for admission. Give them a rage room
on the 4th of July.
That actually been lit. Pretty hot.
Come light firework fireworks off inside
my house.
Oh my gosh.
It would be pretty uh it would be pretty
good to get my Hummer off the pole.
I like the Hummer on the pole. I think
it&#39;s legendary, but like my point is if
we&#39;re going to take it down, it&#39;s got to
come down for a really good reason. And
uh then we&#39;re going to need to put
something else up there. And I think the
Jeeperini would be a good fit just
because it&#39;s damn near toasted. I mean,
the other fake Lamborghini is still nice
in some degree and I like the way it
looks in the farm, but I think if we put
the Jeep Bergini up there, it&#39;s just
like another thing like people is that a
lifted Lamborghini? Like what is that?
You know,
that thing after Rednecks with Paychecks
I think got the most toasted out of any
of the vehicles.
I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve watched it since
after Rednecks with Paycheck. Like that
thing&#39;s probably fully locked up. Like
that mud turned to concrete when it
dried. That [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] was insane.
We could put up another pole and put the
whole F3 trillion limo up there.
Oh, that&#39;d be so good.
It&#39;s too good to put on a pole at this
point, but it would be pretty crazy. We
had two like it&#39;s spanning a whole big
It&#39;s like way too dangerous to probably
do and and not enough of a payoff to
risk, but uh just throwing a rope ladder
on the Hummer ponch just crawling up
there and sitting in it. But like it
just I mean
I think we&#39;d have to we&#39;d actually have
to tack weld that thing to the
poles. Yeah. I mean is it&#39;s probably
fine is the thing. But also we&#39;d get up
there and then who knows? It&#39;s maybe
just 100 lbs from one of them breaking,
you know, like you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s
at. But granted it does hold snow and
not not break. I I&#39;d just love for that
thing to fall one day. I just think
that&#39;d be hilarious. But
I really thought it would have in like
the first week of it being up there. I
thought we were going to get one good
storm and that sucker was going to blow
down, but never did.
I was expecting the springtime when all
the the snow melted and kind of soften
the ground up.
Oh, you&#39;re thinking the whole pole
The whole pole is going to
What up? We got Rolly Boy.
It isn&#39;t on yet. It&#39;s going to be
Hold up.
Clap it up. Clap it up. Clap it up.
Rolly boy. Here we go. Oh, look at him
throwing it up. Look at him throwing it
up. Oh my gosh, dude.
Keep that tongue in your mouth. Was it a
long time coming? You&#39;re 19.
Yeah, I&#39;m 19 with a Ro. Yeah, man. I&#39;ve
waited my whole life for this. You guys
know I always wear that cheap watch and
that cheap watch broke when we were
doing the back flips with the pit bikes.
I was jumping off Micah&#39;s mule and it
caught and the band actually bent, but
I&#39;ve been saving up for a few years.
Good for you, buddy. It is black dial,
black bezel.
Where the hell did you get it?
I got it in Fargo.
You get new or or secondhand?
I believe it&#39;s pre, but it&#39;s pretty much
brand new. Yeah. Looks good.
Papers and everything with it.
Yep. Nice.
Oh, nice. Good job. I was worried that
you maybe got it like online and
you got to get the papers with it. Damn,
dude. Congrats. I did not know you were
in the market for a Rolex.
Well, I told you that a couple months
That&#39;s sick, dude. I&#39;m happy for you.
That&#39;s cool.
Yeah. Thank you very much.
Holy boy. Now you&#39;re just throwing that
[&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] off all
walking around like this all the time.
Hey, bud. Oh, what time is it? Did you
ask? I don&#39;t know how to read this
clock. I really don&#39;t carry stuff with
my left hand, but I went to the grocery
store yesterday and I grabbed the
grocery bag with my left hand.
Oh man, that&#39;s cool. Ken, you got to get
a rolly.
You know, I&#39;m uh putting my money into
other things right now.
Yeah, he&#39;s got an Apple Watch.
I actually almost bought an Apple Watch.
Like, I want to track my steps. And I&#39;m
also trying to not look at my phone so
So, you&#39;re going to be looking at his
little [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] watch. No, I just I think
I check my phone a lot to see if like
the group chat&#39;s been going off or
something&#39;s happening and I&#39;m missing it
and then it just created this like
anxiety and that I&#39;m like always looking
at my phone. Like I&#39;m like literally
walking from here to there. I look at my
Like keeping track of my steps is why I
bought the Apple Watch when we started
the fitness thing. I was like, &#34;Okay, I
Oh, really? I thought you had one long
before that. You four generations.
I haven&#39;t worn it for like a few years
and I was like, &#34;Okay, I got I&#39;m going
to get a new one. I&#39;m going to try and
like keep track of what I&#39;m doing all
day.&#34; That&#39;s that&#39;s the whole reason why
I bought it.
I guess I can&#39;t say much. I wear a Whoop
band, butoop.
Dude, I kind of converted over before I
was like Apple Watch all the time
because I like getting the notifications
on my wrist, whatever. So, I wouldn&#39;t
check my phone. But then I discovered
once I got a few other watches that I
just genuinely use my watch to tell the
But then I also was like, this is such a
funny thing to Google. I just Googled
this like two days ago. Why are watches
so expensive? And the general consensus
came down to because of the price.
That doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t seem very uh
explanatory, but like
it is at the end of the day. It&#39;s like
uh watch is jewelry. They were like yes,
it takes lots of precision machining,
engineering, high quality materials, but
like but that is only going to get you
to they&#39;re saying like a Rolex costs
like a,000 to like 2,000 to make for a
basic one.
Really? They got that much of a markup
on there.
Exactly. At the end of the day, huge
People are willing to pay. So then why
would you not sell them for that much?
Yes, they they last for a long time. I
think that&#39;s a big part of it. But like
at the end of the day, if you want to
just like tell the time, then just like
or something.
The exclusivity um how it&#39;s built and
like Rolex are handmade,
right? And the exclusivity is a big one.
I just thought it was funny that I had
to Google it when I really It is. It&#39;s
just jewelry. Can I ask you?
It&#39;s just an expensive luxury good.
That&#39;s That&#39;s all it is.
It is. I got I have three Rolexes. I
guess I only have two now because I gave
one of them to Mac. Well, I didn&#39;t give
it. We gave Legendary. You guys You guys
paid me back for it.
I wondered if you got paid back for
Yeah, I still kind of took a loss cuz I
think appreciative, but I just sold it
for what it was.
I just thought it was Yeah, it was
really nice of you cuz I was just like,
&#34;Yo, like thinking about giving Mac a
Rolex.&#34; And then in like 2 hours we had
this minty ass Rolex and I was like,
&#34;How did we get
sacrificed? I sacrificed mine. But uh
where I was going is I had three. Some
of them are great investments. Some of
them are at the least store values. Like
Dalton&#39;s not going to lose money on his
watch. Like the one that you guys just
going to kind of stay at exactly what
you bought it for. But what&#39;d you pay
for that thing, Dton? Can I ask you or
Uh 102.
102. That&#39;s why I figured about 10 grand
for that watch.
Yeah, [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] a daily.
I got I had This is the new daily.
This is the new wear this until uh till
I can&#39;t anymore. until it does.
No, I was saying a a vehicle
where you car
that&#39;s still coming. This this cash I&#39;ve
been saving up. I&#39;ve been
Okay, that&#39;s separate separate saves.
So interrupted nothing to do with buying
a daily.
The thing is you can&#39;t just go into the
Rolex store and buy a new Rolex most of
the time. Like they&#39;ll maybe only have
one that you could buy and it&#39;s just one
in the whole place just because someone
backed out on it. But like you have to
order it and then wait. It can sometimes
be years before it comes depending which
one you get. So, if you want to get it
now, they&#39;re immediately worth more what
they actually
MS have. What&#39;s up, buddy?
What&#39;s going on?
How you doing?
Hey, guys.
The whole fam. You guys ready for our uh
golf tournament tomorrow or what?
We are.
Hell yeah.
I heard you&#39;re the stick, John.
We&#39;ll see.
We&#39;re the defending champs this year.
No, I don&#39;t know about that. But
you guys called me last year all laried
up like, &#34;We won. We won. We took
first.&#34; I was like, &#34;Oh, really?&#34; And
you&#39;re like, &#34;Yeah, we took first.&#34;
Thought we did good the last tournament,
too. And then I heard we got last. So, I
don&#39;t know.
That&#39;s true.
First to last. That&#39;s true. Well, we&#39;re
going to get some practice. Dalton&#39;s
playing with us, too. Did you know that?
So, we got five. That should help our
odds, but we went
We went and practiced over there. Was it
yesterday? Two days ago. So, we&#39;re
Where&#39;s the tournament at?
Just down the road. Not too far. So,
Patty, welcome. This is your first time
It is. I&#39;m happy to be here.
Good. We&#39;re happy to have you. Could we
interview for you for like five seconds
with about Ev? Have you and EV on? Is
that okay?
Ev, you want to hop on?
I knew this was
Do I have time to use the restroom? No,
you got time.
She&#39;s out of here.
This is going to be good. What&#39;s up, Ev?
You&#39;ve been winning big.
How long are you going to be here, Ev?
Will you be here this weekend?
Going golfing.
Nice. Where?
Back home.
See, I golfed Sunday, Tuesday,
Wednesday. Going to golf today. Going to
golf tomorrow, golf Saturday, and golf
Oh [&amp;nbsp;__&amp;nbsp;] bro.
Yeah, a lot of golfing.
Been on a run.
A lot of golfing. Well, at least you&#39;ll
have your swings in.
Yeah, my back&#39;s starting to feel it
today after that drive, but should be
all right.
How&#39;s golfing with Slim?
Train wreck, but fun.
No, he&#39;s getting it together pretty
good, honestly.
Getting better.
He&#39;ll just like make a 10-on one hole
and then par the next one. Just
honestly, like the rest of us.
Yeah, I was like, that&#39;s how I golf.
It&#39;s insane how popular golf is getting.
Like obviously it&#39;s always been popular,
but like seems like all my friends are
doing it now. And you would ask me last
year I had like two.
Slim&#39;s kind of funny. He was always
like, &#34;Oh, going golfing, like
whatever.&#34; Just like never kind of
thinking it was lame.
And he&#39;d go out like play nine holes
once every 5 years and not hit it very
good and then was just like over it. But
now that he&#39;s been out, he&#39;s been
playing like every weekend this summer
and he&#39;s getting better. Like every time
he goes out just like the rest of, you
know, getting better, getting better.
Now he&#39;s like hooked. Come on in, Patt.
It&#39;s kind of like Dalton buying all the
accessories and just like just opened up
a whole new event or sport, whatever.
Well, we have Evan&#39;s mom.
Thank you.
Welcome. This is your first time up here
ever, isn&#39;t it?
Well, yes. To this place. Yes.
And Evan&#39;s been here for 4 years.
He always he always mentioned he was
always like, &#34;Yeah, my mom really wants
to come up.&#34; But
I think he doesn&#39;t want you to see his
Well, I was just going to say, did he
clean his room?
I&#39;m kind of afraid to see it.
No, I I I chucked some packages in
It&#39;s decent.
It&#39;s been worse. It&#39;s been worse. It&#39;s
been worse.
It&#39;s medium right now.
Probably smells fine, I&#39;m assuming.
I won&#39;t judge.
Well, I mean, it&#39;s probably been this
way his whole life, I&#39;d imagine. Hasn&#39;t
Are you kidding me? Well, oh, no, but I
was really fussy growing up, and now I
feel like this is part of your
rebellion, but that&#39;s okay.
He&#39;s rebelling at age 30. I&#39;m not
cleaning my room.
No, you can&#39;t come over.
Yeah, that&#39;s awesome. Well, welcome.
We&#39;ll have to
give you a tour.
Yeah, we&#39;re excited to show you around
the full tour. And
you guys are only here for a day,
though. But like I said, we were doing
the golf tournament, but yeah, maybe hop
in, have his Lam Lamborghini, go to his
or something, hit the boat.
He did say I could drive it.
You haven&#39;t drove it yet?
Have you gotten a ride in it?
Not that one. I I haven&#39;t Oh, the other
I wrote in the giveaway one, but yeah, I
do want to drive the Lamborghini and I
would like to drive something on the
Yeah, I was just gonna say that. What
you need to do before we go golfing is
Evan needs to take you for a ride in the
drift Miata.
Oh, yeah.
That is a the ride of your life.
The convertible.
It is actually like it&#39;ll be insanely
scary, but also you&#39;re in great hands.
Like he could drive it with his eyes
closed. I think
we trust Deon. I do. We should actually
have Gav throw some new tires on that
thing or something so ready. It&#39;s ready
to rip.
They&#39;re probably like half like halfife.
You&#39;re brand new for Uncle Rich and we
did a half Yeah, probably half burn.
Yeah. So like did you know Evan was
going to end up like how do I describe
you? I mean a legend in terms of you can
drive or rip any vehicle. Anything
wheels and a motor is your specialty.
And you grew up on a golf course. So,
like golf was kind of your your sport,
wasn&#39;t it?
I mean, I definitely played it a lot
growing up, but I always wanted to do
action sports, but I was never really
allowed to have motors.
So, I just skateboarding, BMX.
My dad wanted me to be the golfer. Maybe
that pushed me away a little bit too
more cuz that&#39;s
I want my kids to be golfers, too.
That&#39;d be great.
But, uh, yeah. So, you weren&#39;t allowed
to have like dirt bikes or anything
until you were 19 or whatever.
snowmobile when you were what 15 or 16.
Yeah. I mean my grandpa had like
How fast did you crash then?
So he&#39;s been crashing stuff since a
young age. So you&#39;re almost protecting
Yes. Totally. When he was younger.
Totally. Yes.
Was when we had So you guys had got me
that snowmobile. First snow. I crashed
it into a culvert. When they bring it to
the shop.
You can&#39;t you can&#39;t control that.
Hold on. So you hopped on it and then
broke it right away.
I mean like 10 minutes.
Oh good. Probably. He wasn&#39;t like No,
I&#39;m trying to think. It might have
actually made it one full winter, but it
was the following winter and there was
like 6 in of snow cuz I got it for
Christmas and we had snow that year, but
so maybe it was the next year, but
there&#39;s 6 in of snow. Shouldn&#39;t have
been riding. Buried in a culvert.
They&#39;re pissed. We get it fixed and it
they my dad drops drops it off and you
guys had to go somewhere. I don&#39;t know
if you&#39;re going to dinner or whatever.
You said don&#39;t touch the snowmobile. So
the second you guys left the
neighborhood, I hopped on the snowmobile
and you know when you&#39;re going like
really fast on an icy road going like 50
just start sliding sideways and then
just torpedo the goddamn thing and like
the culvert just like bent up the front
a little bit. This
that that was the end of it.
Well, yeah. Pile Yeah. Hood busted and
handlebar. Yeah. Really jacked it up.
What What age was this at?
15 probably.
Oh wow.
Okay. So this this is the first I&#39;ve
heard that&#39;s exactly what happened. This
detail, but you told us you simply drove
it up to the country club parking lot,
which is literally 50 yards away, and
just rolled it on a snowbank in the
parking lot.
Yeah. No, I was going pretty fast. It
was pretty scary. No helmet, no no like
snow gear, just like a sweatshirt and
tennis shoes, you know?
Yeah, of course.
I wasn&#39;t going to do anything crazy.
Just ride it for like 10 seconds real
quick and put it back.
A quick full throttle pull down the ice.
Literally what it was, just pull out.
just hit it wide open and probably
didn&#39;t let off until I was upside down.
That is my nickname for him is full
that&#39;s a good nickname for him.
When did he get that nickname was when
he was
I don&#39;t think he even knows that that&#39;s
what I would refer to him. Did you know
that, Evan?
Not necessarily. I guess I&#39;ve maybe
heard you say it a few times.
Yeah, I that&#39;s what I would call you.
Probably not to your face, but yeah, not
in a bad way, but um
it&#39;s a compliment. When did you know or
did you did you know that Evan would
have such a knack for a camera? Like
Evan is such an entertainer. Has he
always been that way? Like when he was
when he was a kid and you were filming
home videos, was he good on camera or
was he like me and just kind of curled
No, he liked to perform. I mean, he
didn&#39;t mind being on the camera.
We loved it. We always wanted to watch
it back like right at like you were
still like, &#34;No, go do some stuff.&#34;
We&#39;re like, &#34;No, we want to watch it.&#34;
Yes. You You and your sister both like
which a lot of kids do. they like to be
videotaped and then watch it back. But
um yeah, you like to perform, you like
to do whether it&#39;s magic shows, stunts,
um anything that could be videotaped.
And then you were lucky that David was
your friend who had the equipment and
could video you. And
so like when he was young, was there any
signs of like this guy&#39;s got some
daredevil in him like at a very young
age? like any pre precursors to
tell them about when the neighbor had to
come over about the ramp I built.
Oh yeah, you were little and I was not
watching. You were in the backyard
playing and and the neighbor guy called
me and he&#39;s like, &#34;Patty, do you see
what Evan&#39;s building in your driveway?&#34;
And I go out and he had found a whole
bunch of boards and probably ladders and
things and they were all stacked up to
make this scary looking huge jump which
I recall part of it being held up with
like a vertical hockey stick like
something that was never going to work.
It was so sketchy. Yeah. So then I came
out and helped him dismantle that and
there was no injuries as far as I know.
Um in the driveway. But when you took we
took the training wheels off your bike.
You took off like a madman and never
went down and was like
You mean the first thing I did is I ran
right into the tree. You didn&#39;t know how
to steer back could me.
Well, no. I thought without the training
wheels that I had to go f like the speed
was what was going to keep me on two
wheels. So, I just started pedaling and
I just shot across the yard and just
went right into the trees.
My buddy Ken did that once.
Man, I would have loved to have known
little Evan. That would have been
hilarious. He was going 100 miles an
hour most of the time.
Never stopped.
Who do you think he got his daredevil
from? John or you?
Definitely me over John.
Patty, you don&#39;t strike me as a
daredevil. I hate to say
before I had kids I was, but I had a big
old 59 Osmo and I would drag race the
boys on Highway 61.
I had a big old engine. Um, yeah, a
little bit for a short time. I was kind
of wild. But otherwise, once I had kids,
I was I became very much uh more of a
At least I never gave you much to worry
Do you have any other funny stories of
uh Evan getting in trouble at a young
age or doing something funny like that?
Oh yeah.
Oh gosh. You used to sneak out at night
and I didn&#39;t realize that. He would come
home like his curfew was say at 11:00.
I even got a broke my foot one night,
snuck back into the house with a broken
foot and then pretend to fall on the
You fall on the stairs.
Just finding out about this. John&#39;s
like, &#34;What?&#34;
Maybe I never did tell him. I know. You
You knew.
Evan&#39;s dad&#39;s just finding this out now.
Yeah. I rolled my ankle running from the
cops and I broke my foot.
Yeah. And they we think it&#39;s just a
fresh injury that happened going
downstairs.
Oh, it was so brutal. I had to wait for
like 6, seven hours and my foot&#39;s just
swallowing, throbbing. I got to wait
until morning and then maybe made it
till like 6 or 6 a believable time and
kind of clunk clunk stumble on the
That&#39;s pretty The hardest part. That&#39;s
pretty good. The hardest part would have
been faking your falling down the stairs
with an already broken.
Well, no one was really watching. I just
needed to make a little noise and I
don&#39;t know.
Did you already tell them about the
Santa Claus Santa Claus?
Santa Claus story.
My mom has these window clings that look
like a Santa Claus or an elf or a
reindeer and they&#39;re kind of like makes
it look like they&#39;re peeking. You put it
in the corner of a window.
And I went to I was sneaking. I remember
it was winter and there&#39;s a big tall
snowbank and I was walking. I look over
the snowbank and I see this face in the
window. She must have just put the
window clings up. So I like and I&#39;m
wearing like shorts cuz I&#39;m just snuck
out and got picked up and then I got
dropped off. So I&#39;m like laying in the
snowbank and in shorts and every time I
I look up, oh god, he&#39;s still looking.
They&#39;re still looking. But I don&#39;t think
they saw me because they&#39;d probably do
something. So then after like 10
minutes, I hear the garage door opening
and I realize my dad&#39;s snowblowing the
driveway in the front yard. I&#39;m in the
backyard and I look and that face is
still like 6:30, 7 in the morning.
And then yeah, finally I realized, well,
if my dad&#39;s out there snowblowing,
then I look a little closer. I&#39;m like,
&#34;Oh, fuck.&#34;
As the sun starts to come up.
That&#39;s actually funny. Kept you outside
for a little while.
I did have a good run at the Not that I
was doing anything wrong. Probably just
like a curfew thing, but ran from the
cops twice.
Not that I was doing anything.
Never never got in trouble.
I had I had a good story, too. Running
from the cops around same age. I think
everyone kind of did that.
But it&#39;s a good way to get some cardio.
I thought you were going to say some
cred. Some street cred.
Street cred.
Oh, yeah.
I think that that&#39;s all we really had
for today for the podcast. We were we
were going for like an hour before this.
So nice.
I do think that you should do the Miata
ride if you want. That that maybe be
even worth like just filming for like
throw a GoPro just like a couple cams.
Like it&#39;d be a funny little bit.
I don&#39;t know. Maybe you&#39;ll be just stone
cold just chilling. She&#39;ll probably ask
to drive.
She&#39;ll be screaming.
she screamed when I when I hammered down
on the Lambo for like didn&#39;t even get
going fast. Just did like a 10 to 70
pull or whatever and she was shrieking
and I was I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I knew
it was fine. I just shrieked.
No, I just didn&#39;t expect it.
My mom did the same thing.
Your mom does the same. Yeah, my mom
does the same, so it&#39;s okay. But, uh,
yeah. Sweet. Sounds great. Thank you,
